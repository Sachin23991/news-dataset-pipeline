Ned Lamont (D) told Balance of Power wind power is essential to bringing down energy costs in New England. \n\nThe US is suspending leases for all five wind farms under construction off the East Coast, the latest blow to an industry that’s been targeted repeatedly by the Trump administration as part of its attack on clean energy.\nThe US Interior Department announced the move Monday, citing national security concerns as the massive turbines may interfere with radar systems. The suspension will let the administration work with developers and states to mitigate any security risks, the department said in a statement.\nThe projects impacted are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Coastal Virginia, which lies off the coast of its titular state; Revolution Wind, near Rhode Island; and Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind, both off the coast of New York. The five projects represent about $28b in total committed capital, according to BloombergNEF. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIf, in fact, this is halted here. The mayor of New London, Michael Bizzaro, says the Grinch has just stolen Christmas. Is he right? Not a heck of a Christmas present, was it? What you just heard the president say. It does high wind power, but he's not the leader of things that were committed a long time ago. Are we in revolution when was actually permitted under from one back in 2000, 1890. So a long time ago. So this was a real shock to our system. They did it to us over Labor Day as well. Remember, they had a stop work order, no warning at all this time. They've pulled the permits and we've got to fight like hell to come back because they're never going to bring down the price of electricity in New England unless we get more generation. And that's what wind power does. Governor, in September, your state successfully won its bid in courts to lift the moratorium that the Trump administration put in when it first took office on wind power. Now, the administration is going at it again and raising national security concerns. Some analysts are looking at that and saying this could be a more durable way to essentially do the same thing. What's your take? And do you think those national security concerns are legitimate? No, I think the president said I don't like wind power. Come up with another way that I think you can shut it down. And it was only very recently they came up with these are national security concerns. I talked to the secretary of interior, Doug Burgum. I known for many years. I said, I'm not sure this is real, but if you want to, we'll come down, we'll talk to you about it. We'll bring down the folks building the wind power, the engineers. But don't stop us in maybe construction for the second time in three months. You're just blowing a hole in our efforts to bring down the price of electricity in New England. You know, we understand that this project is about 85% complete. It would power some 350,000 homes across Connecticut and Rhode Island. What will happen to electricity bills without the wind farm more likely to spike if we can't get pipes in the ground and get natural gas and oil? We're just not that type of the state. We don't have the capacity is very rare that we can create our own generation. Offshore wind is one way we can do that. And the more generation we have, the less spiking energy during very cold periods. And that means we can save money for electric ratepayers. We want to welcome our viewers joining us from the TV side, Bloomberg TV colleagues. And we are here with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, talking, of course, about this new announcement out of the Department of Energy today, putting a halt on those five major wind farm projects, including the one that's being assembled in your state. Governor, I'm curious how this is going to play with constituents, not only in your state but across the country as energy prices are expensive, it's cold and they're looking to spike. You know, the energy crisis is something that's constantly talked about. This is also an administration that is trying to remove barriers to other forms of energy, including nuclear. The president has said he wants to restart coal. So why not add wind energy to that? Why is this specific mechanism of generating power in his crosshairs? It is contradictory. I've talked to the president about this. He cares very strongly about bringing down the price of electricity, especially in New England, where we don't have a lot of our own generation and gets expensive. I said, We'll work with you on a nuclear power to work with you on natural gas and other sources. But don't pull the plug on a plant that's already 85% complete, ready to turn on in just a few months. That makes no sense at all. I thought we had an agreement. They weren't going to do that. Then we were shocked. All right. Well, I want to get back to the justification from the administration here, Governor, and I know you commented on this briefly, but I'd like to hear more about the national security concerns or lack there of knowing that the Interior Department says these turbines may interfere with radar systems. We understand, however, according to the attorney general, William Tong, the project's already gone through a federal review. He says fully vetted, permitted state, federal, up and down, inside out every which way you can. Is that correct? WILLIAMS Absolutely correct. And actually, it went through a very strong national security review over the last few years, voted on on a bipartisan basis in Congress just a year and a half ago. What they said with the administration just making this already, it is the administration just making this up then. I think so. But look, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Get us down there. Will bring the very best engineers from worst. Ed, who's a developer, will talk it through. But there's no excuse for shutting this down in mid-stride. Not in the ninth inning of the ballgame. Look, they're saying drones has changed the world dramatically. They want to take a second look and, you know, on shore radar and then change the world in the last 12 months. Also, this is not the point you made earlier. This is not a new technology. These wind turbines have existed in Europe, much to the president's chagrin, for quite a few years now. We haven't previously heard of it having big impacts on NAITO or Europe's military readiness in offshore areas there. We've also got some reporting from Bloomberg and analysts at Raymond James saying I'm skeptical that there's any new information about the military concerns all of a sudden that singlehandedly warrants these projects being halted. So do you think this is an aesthetic, not necessarily an economic or national security decision? You know, I mean, last time around it was birds and whales. This time around, it's radar. I don't know what it's going to be next time. I got to tell you, I come out of the business world. I thought the Trump administration had a lot of business folks and it was going to be a pro-business administration. But this herky jerky on again, off again. First, they didn't snap. Now they're doing wind power. Makes it very difficult to do business with this administration. Very difficult. Well, I'd like to hear more about that just from your view. In Connecticut, you mentioned SNAP. We can add Obamacare subsidies that are about to expire, sending people's bills higher. How much are you and other governors working to fill affordability gaps that are being created by the administration? I can tell you here in Connecticut, we've set aside, you know, $500 million just to lease protect the most vulnerable. But the idea that you're going to yank food support from working families when food prices have almost doubled in the last five years made no sense. And it's pointed out when it comes to the health care subsidies on the exchange, people are going to see their bills go up one or $2,000. That's a heck of a Christmas present. And that's a real shock to the system. So we made sure that we protected all of our families up to about 128,000. Then we soften the blow for everybody else. Governor, you said you've been talking to the Trump administration throughout this process and about this decision, how they're treating it previously. I'm wondering, did you get any kind of a heads up? Have you spoken to the president since this decision came down? And if not, what do you want to tell him? No, This really came out of left field at the very last moment. We had had a conference call, all the governors with secretaries. And right just a couple of weeks ago talking about pipelines and natural gas just did not come up at all. Like I said, I think this is a problem, a solution, looking for a problem and it's the wrong solution. Just lastly, then, Governor, what would you tell people driving to work today in Putnam, Connecticut, who are already looking at expensive electric bills? They're worried about the data center that might be coming in next door. Do they need to brace for higher prices? And what will they look like in 2026? Well, we're seeing a pause on data centers just because they suck so much electricity and drive up costs. But one of the things we need is more generation. I think those rate payers in Putnam know all too well. We're doing everything we can to add more electricity generation, bring down costs for you and your family and call the Cleveland revolution. Win in the ninth inning. Makes no sense at all. Well, this is something that we're going to keep talking about here. It sounds like you might not have a sense or be able to quantify how much those bills are going to rise. Governor, is that fair to say? I can tell you that it's going to go up and it could go up dramatically during very cold times when wind power is generating the most and we're going to have a spike in energy demand. That's what I'm trying to protect you from.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:34:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:32.832007"}

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nCan. Logan, great to have both of you here in studio. Of course, the kickoff to season three of the Golden Touch and talk a little bit about just the process of filming this series for Netflix, of course, alongside Logan Paul, who appears in at least two or three of those episodes here. Oh, look, I love the show, You know, King of Collectibles, The Golden Touch. This is our third season launch today. It's, you know, takes you into the incredible world of collectibles. The value of the items, the history behind it, the story of the chase, the excitement, and also the personalities that collect the items that buy the items. And you know why the collectibles are so incredibly important. It's a fast paced show, and I love doing it. I'm I hope I'm doing it ten years from now. When you talk about personalities, no one's a bigger personality than Logan. Paul, you seem to be clutching your chest right now. Is that because you're wearing a very expensive jacket? Yeah. Well, yeah, the jacket is expensive, but that's neither here nor there. No, it's because I have the most expensive Pokemon card around my neck, and I. Yeah, Look, Super Bowl might be one of one PSA ten Pikachu Illustrator that is on season three of show, the most coveted card in the world. Absolutely. So those folks who aren't Pokémon experts, I mean, you famously bought this card back in 2021, the most expensive one ever. And this is a rarity. I mean, these cards weren't really sold. They were just kind of given out. Right. And at some point, you managed to get a hold of one of the few, not only just intact ones, but I'm pretty sure this is the highest rated one out there. Yeah, it's the only one in the world that's a PSA ten. Meaning it's perfect. Yeah. And like I said, it's one of one. Like you said, it was one of 39 copies handed out in 1998 for a Pokemon illustration contest. So this card couldn't be bought. It was earned, which is part of the reason why the lore contributes to such a high value for the card. When you pay what by most reports is upwards of $5 million. For this, there are a lot of people. They said you are an idiot. Yeah. Like, what is he doing? Who would pay that much for a card? Now I'm told that you're actually willing to put this back onto the market. You think you're going to get more than the five $5.3 million that you paid for it? Look, that's honestly always the goal, right? But I actually say willing is a great word. I had to be convinced to put this card at auction. Ken has chased me for years trying to convince you to sell the card. And let's be honest, the Pokemon market is as hot as it's ever been right now. And those people who thought I was an idiot, I think I'm the one laughing in the face now because Pokemon has delivered higher returns than the stock market in the past 20 years. Buy it by upwards of 3,000%. And so while I think this will probably go for more than I bought it for, it's an auction, but it is the best card in the world. There's nothing like it and it's a piece of history now. I wore it out to my WrestleMania debut. It's on Ken's Netflix show, and I think we're excited to see what he can go for. And it's funny you bring it up and we talk about this idea of collecting or just let's start with art, right? That was what if you had a lot of money, you bought your your Monets or Jackson Pollock, things like that. There was sort of this wave a few years ago with this younger generation coming in, Ken, as you know, that were much more interested in things like Pokemon cards, Magic, the gathering cards, sports memorabilia, and a lot of people kind of scratch their heads. What's that really worth? Comic books, you know, hip hop memorabilia. It's really expanded. Talk about how that's expanded your business away from the more traditional collectibles that we think about here. What you have to realize is that collectibles as a category right now is an asset class. It is an alternative asset class. And while maybe in, you know, in 100 years ago and also in the 1930, 40 or 5060s, you know, collecting art, whether it was Picasso, whether it was Renoir, whether it was Monet, Warhol to go more recent, you know, was what the, quote, super Rich did. And that was the traditional collectibles. You know, people who, you know, grew up worshipping athletes and people you know of, you know, a little younger than me who grew up on Pokemon, which has its 30th anniversary in February this year. You know, they did not grow up dreaming about owning a big art collection. And as they get into their thirties and forties and fifties and late twenties, they have a lot of money. So to them, owning the best of the best, whether it's a Pokemon card, whether it's a game used jersey, whether it's a sports card, that is what they aspire to be, and that is how we can see something like a basketball card with pictures of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant sell for 12 and a half million dollars. Yeah, that's how we can see a jersey worn by Babe Ruth sell for 24 million. That's how I can sell a baseball that was hit by Shohei Ohtani for 4.4 million. And that's how we can see, you know, the Pokemon illustrator. This single best card. Yeah, I did the entire poker. My genre, which is the world's biggest franchise, sell for eight figures. But there's also added value to it as well. Obviously the card in and of itself has value, but the fact that it's associated with someone like Logan Paul or you have a celebrity, I mean, there's a rarity, as you know, in the collectibles market that drives price. And you talk about you wearing it in your WWE debut and the other facts. I mean, that has to add to the value, right? Not only that, am I going to get this illustrator card, but I'm taking the illustrator card that was once owned by Logan Paul We will see. I would I would certainly think. Right. But the card's only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Like Ken said, Pokemon is the highest grossing, most popular franchise in the world. It's a Guinness World Record setting card as well at this point. So yeah, it has the lore, it has the story, It does have all of the ingredients include the actual substances substance of the card itself. Yeah. To potentially sell for eight figures like Ken said. But you know, well we'll see what people are willing to pay for it. I would also like to point out most people don't wear eight figures around their neck. Is now is the is the change is the framing and the changes that come with it. It just doesn't. Yeah. And I asked if I could do it. I want to hand-deliver it to the buyer because when I bought this card from the guy who I chased it down for from four years, he was in Dubai and he made it an experience for me and it contributed to how I felt about the card. And so who for whoever buys it, I would like to reciprocate that and make it an experience for them as well by delivering it myself. Logan Talk about some of the other things that you've bought, collectibles that you've bought, and I am curious also, how do you make sure that what you're getting is authentic, that you don't sort of get taken by somebody trying to find something off? Well, actually, I've bought a decent art from Golden Auctions, and the goal there is that auction houses have a reputation, and that reputation hopefully means that the items you're buying from them is authentic. So the authenticity is kind of like a check when I buy most of these items. But man, I'm a I'm a collector of all sorts of things. I have Michael Jordan Fleer rookie and PSA ten. I have Erling Haaland's, one of one super factor. I got Wayne Gretzky's last championship game hockey stick for $336,000. I bought a meteorite older than the Earth, 4.5 billion years old for like $80,000. KS bears the dinosaur skull. A triceratops skull in my living room. Yeah. Painting a Bob Ross, Right? Dude, I love collectibles. Yeah, because they mean something to me. They're an art piece, and hopefully they appreciate in value because it's part of this strategic asset class that I think people are now finally becoming aware of and so can talk about that asset class. I mean, we're talking about a market now, the collectibles market. If you just take traditional art out of it, you're talking about a few hundred dollars Billion now and it gets you this idea of what comes next. I mean, what do you think that next generation are going to be chasing after? Because I assume it's going to be something maybe a little bit different. Sure. I mean, look, I think as far as sports cards, what I tell people is, you know, professional baseball has been around since the 1860s and baseball cards have been around since the 1860s. So I think the traditional stuff, like trading cards of all genres, you know, is certainly going to continue to only rise in popularity, especially when you have some of the larger companies like PSA and fanatics with, you know, billions of dollars invested in the industry and athletes getting into it. You know, anything can really become a collectible. And to me, you know, just because I don't collect what somebody else collects doesn't mean it's not a collectible. For example, we had our first ever rock and roll and hip hop auction. We set records. I mean, whether it was Tupac, whether it was Nirvana, whether it was Guns and Roses, this stuff was going for Absolutely. Eminem. I mean, crazy prices for four albums and four greatest albums. And what really made the trading card market take off? Yeah, is when the great grading companies came in. And now there are companies that grade, you know, cassettes and albums and CDs and the market's taking off. And it's funny to mention, I mean, the hip hop auction was big. You know, somebody who collects a lot of stuff from hip hop, a lot of the stuff was seen as worthless just a few years ago. And now you have, I think with Christie's or Sotheby's doing their own sort of hip hop auctions. But it gets to this idea and I want to get to this idea with you, Logan, the idea of kind of being an outsider, I mean, your fame and your celebrity did not go through the traditional path, obviously, with Vine and YouTube and eventually with wrestling and all the other ventures that you have here. And I do wonder if that parallels kind of what we're seeing also in collectibles, where you have people just saying, no, we don't need to do it the old fashioned way in terms of, you know, what we collect and how it's true. I mean, yeah, collecting is nice because if you're passionate about something or even just care a little bit, you can make a foray into the hobby. Like, Dude, I started collecting rocks when I was a kid and then it moved to coins and then it graduated to footballs. And my interests have changed and I made a lot of money and I spend it on cardboard and, you know, like you said. Some people laughed at me at the time. But collecting is nice because like, you don't need a credential to start. You can just buy things that interest you. And you know, like I said, the goal is always that they appreciate in value. All right. Season three is out now or coming out now. What else is next for you and you and Logan? Well, we we have a as people will find out by watching the show. We have planned together what we believe will be the biggest TCG trading card game auction in history. The illustrator is going to be the anchor and there is going to be millions and millions and millions of other dollars of other items. You know, Pokémon Magic, The Gathering, and similar items. And we're going to have the auction is going to launch in January. It's going to close February 15th and timing it for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon. And that's something that, you know, we're looking you know, my worst case scenario on that is 15 million. I'd love to do a 25 or $30 million auction with that. And that's that's really, to me, a big event for the industry. I can tell you what's happening for the industry right now. Over the past six weeks, I've been contacted by multiple firms that are either in existence or just starting up or want to start up to have, you know, basically funds dedicated to collectibles. When you say funds like coins, like like, like, like, like, like a gold fund or a crypto fund, but a collectible fund and, you know, whether it's $50 million or 250 million, we seen that, I mean, or something like an even an ETF or something. That's exactly what people are looking to do for now. There is there is one company out there that is doing it. They're doing it solely with basketball cards. These these people want to do a more broader basket. And, you know, as as probably hobby wise, the most well-known guy, they're coming to me and asking for advice. But I, I think that that is really going to take the market to the next level. And you think that's possible? I mean, what are the regulations? You think there is a successful fund? Yes, that's operating right now. Yeah. And but it's very private, very closely held. Sure. But I do think that, you know, there's so much opportunity, I expect that to happen.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:31:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:42:12.375284"}

{"title": "Baby Bonds vs. Trump Accounts", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-12-24/baby-bonds-vs-trump-accounts-video", "summary": "A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. Darrick Hamilton, Henry Cohen Professor of Economics and Urban Policy at the New School, is behind a comparable concept known as \"baby bonds,\" which he sees as a means to granting more social mobility and agency to young people regardless of family income levels. Professor Hamilton compares and contrasts his idea with the Trump administration's mechanism with Alexis Christoforous and Isabelle Lee on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat is, I guess, the main difference between baby bonds and the Trump accounts? Because on their face, there seem to be a lot of similarities. Well, conceptually, the goal is to provide access to asset building by way of having some financial capital so that you can get into that building. The problem with the Trump accounts versus baby bonds is baby bonds focus on what actually is the problem. It's one of endowment, essentially the way wealth is created, as wealth begets more wealth. It's having a large enough nest egg so that you can get into a home or get into an education without debt, or to be able to have some capital to start a business. The Trump accounts essentially emphasize savings by way of the tax code. So in an ironic way, it's structured in a way that's potentially going to subsidize those that have the wherewithal to raise capital in the first place. What does it signal to you when billionaires step in to fund used wealth building programs? Are we seeing it as innovation that government couldn't achieve on its own, or is it just a quiet shift away from maybe public responsibility? I mean, I applaud philanthropy that desires to be vanguards and trying to create pathways to democratize wealth. However, however, the mechanism in this case is only feeding into a bad system. The federal government should not be ultimately subsidized for their duty. We shouldn't be reliant on the charitable contributions of a billionaire for our salvation. But what a billionaire can do is provide demonstration, be a catalyst, seed some some momentum so that we ultimately can have them invest. And, you know, I'll make one other quick point, which is when you think about the $6.4 billion, which is a huge number, it requires context. So two context points. One is it's contextual to that $4 trillion big, beautiful bill that was referenced at the beginning of the segment. So if we're thinking about the ways in which the federal government is spending wealth towards advancing access to asset building for the population, that 6.4 billion deserves context to that $4 trillion, which is from our public regress. And then the other context, about 80% of children between the ages of zero and ten will have some access to this donation, this regress. But if you were to disaggregate that, that amounts to about $250 per child. Right. So essentially, that's not going to be the catalyst. So it's distracting a little bit. You know, some countries have done this pretty successfully, right? I know. I believe Germany is among them. They'll give an allowance, a monthly allowance to parents for for kids of a certain age. Some countries use it as an incentive to get people to have more children. It's now these baby bonds have been implemented in, let's say, Connecticut since 2023. I believe they were the first state. How are things going? Oh, it's still the infancy there, but how are things going? I mean, Connecticut is a really great model and it's a state, so it doesn't have the capacities of the federal government. But here you have a scenario with every Medicaid birth will receive 30 $200 automatically at birth. And the Treasurer is managing that money in a collective fund in an astute way with responsible investing, where the projections are that the children, you know, low income children born as part of a medicaid birth from rural to urban areas throughout the state will have about 12 to 18000 as some seed capital to begin wealth building. Any you know, other examples would be the U.K. did it. They didn't fund it to the extent that we would call for in the U.S. And then here's perhaps even the best counterfactual. The United States has done similar programs with the GI Bill. That's about right. We have a history of doing this. Do you think that programs like these have an influence to affect economic policy long term, or do you think to create risking a system that just really hinges on, to your point, philanthropy of maybe rich individuals or big corporations? And that's exactly why it should be a government responsibility. And here's the point. This is not charity. This is an investment. So if you believe in the market, if you don't believe in the market regardless, again, it's pretty simple. The way wealth is created, it is that down payment to put you in an asset that passively appreciates over your life. So if you are authentically somebody who believes in transaction in the market, then you should support people having some seed capital to get into that asset. So again, it's a question of endowment, not savings behavior. Is there anything about the Trump accounts that you actually like? I mean, we have to I think we can agree that, you know, the concept I mean, the heart's in the right place. You Well, I mean that to sit at the attention of. On trying to make sure that we democratize access to wealth. That's a good thing. But to structure the 529 structure, we have lessons from that where, you know, 529 saving tax provision savings so that we can provide access to college for our children. The bottom half percent of earners essentially don't participate. Only about 2.5% of Americans participate. So there are really good ways we can do it. My fear is that we co-opt a good idea. It's a really good idea. We have pathways to really facilitate a good value for our American economy, which is inclusion. We just got to work on the delivery. To Alexis point, there's the idea of corp match welfare embedded here. Are there any upsides to that? What should policymakers be cautious about? I apologize for laughing, but the phrasing of of of corporate welfare again, I it I take the Dell's is being not disingenuous but really trying to be supportive. I think there's better ways there's more catalytic ways they could spend that $6.4 billion. But at the end of the day, the American people don't want to be at the whim of billionaires. And then there are other aspects as well that we should be leery about, which is state private partnerships for which we have to be concerned about the potential for grift when we're relying on billionaires to provide economic security for the American people. So if if we're thinking, you know, look, a lot of folks are not going to take advantage of a 529 plan, is that because they don't have the money to do it? Is that because they don't know they exist? Is that because a lot of Americans cannot be left to their own devices to save for themselves? I mean, think about how, you know, some of our our programs like Social Security came to be. It's because it was supposed to be some sort of a safety net. So. So is it a good idea for the government to put aside some money for folks who might not otherwise do it? I mean, that actually is a great idea. But just how in the mechanisms by which we do it, that's the problem. So it is the case that clearly we have an affordability crisis in this country so people don't have the wherewithal to save en masse. And that's a big reason why people don't participate in a 529 counts, not as if they don't love and adore their children and desire for them to have savings. It's wherewithal. And then the other big point is for those that have amassed wealth in America, it's not active saving lives, driving debt. And by active savings income that we actively save, it's passive savings. It's that down payment. It is critical for young adults to really have some capital so that they can get into that automatic vehicle to save.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:54:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T06:44:04.353345"}

From politics and policy to tech and trends, David Ingles and Annabelle Droulers give global investors unique insight, delivering in-depth discussions with the newsmakers who matter. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nGood morning. It's 9 a.m. here in Hong Kong, in Shanghai and in Shenzhen. You're watching the China tour, our final full broadcast of the year coming out to the open markets in Greater China. Let's get to top stories today. Stocks across the region up after tech gains pushing Wall Street to yet another record. Ethics markets in focus with the yuan at its strongest level in over 14 months. Seven is very much in focus. And also in South Korea, warning against excessive weakness in their currency. Gold soaring above 40 $500 an ounce for the very first time. And escalating tensions in Venezuela and lots of bets on more Fed rate cuts in 2026. Also ahead, Washington holding off on new tariffs on Chinese chips even after accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices. Plus, we take a closer look at the challenges facing Chinese battery maker Seattle as the company seeks new markets overseas. Welcome to the program. Hope you're all well. Lots to get through over the next 2 hours or so. Let's get started with what's really been a fairly consistent story almost all year round, with the exception of a few wobbles, as we can see the rally across risk assets. Right. Asia Pacific 2 to 7 right now in the benchmark 3/10 of 1%. As you can see, the tech, the tech sub gauge is leading that one. COSBY There's a separate conversation. We'll get to that in a moment. As far as the currency goes, some strong language coming through out of authorities there, leading to some strength coming through in their currency. Taiwan is coming in line within that market. It's not just tech. We're looking at insurers to given this rule change and effects. More on that as well later on. We talked about the one winning today, dollar one down. As you can see, we're up 1%, stronger than 1% on the Korean currency, 1.4, rather, 156 now on dollar yen. The markets there warning of strong determination as it pertains to maybe these moves in the market might have reached maybe a tad or to a level a notch or two beyond what is comfortable. Question mark. Right. The big story as well in markets is when you have copper at 12,000, we took that out yesterday, 4500 and gold, also a nice round number on platinum. We're up about 3% there in silver, of course, 150% year to date. We took out 70 yesterday. It looks like 72 is a very, very close, if not already on time contracts very quickly the approach of the Chinese market open. So we talked about copper coming up on your screens as well and to see you in China is 7017. And the reason that's important, if that puts us about 0.2 6%, 0.27%, just doing some rough math in my head, which roughly translates to about that's about a one standard deviation move historical that's a daily if we get that which is rare of course, statistically that would take us below seven. Suffice to say it's possible, but unlikely. And we are looking at weakness going into the open today. And of course it's a public service reminder that several markets in the region are operating on truncated sessions today Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and also in New Zealand. Okay, let's have a look at the agenda today. And oh, okay. This is the agenda today. Well, it's partly it. So the next rally we had the Fix. It's an early close in Hong Kong, but yeah, okay, we'll talk about this later. Okay. Let's talk about the chip curbs. Right. The US is holding off when new chip Chinese chip towers until MIT. We'll fix that for you is what I'm trying to say. That's despite accusing Beijing of engaging in unfair trade practices in the chip sector. Let's bring in Min Miller, China correspondent here with us on set to tell us more about this investigation. It's it's something that didn't happen overnight was months long. What did the findings and what what it might mean for her policy. Yeah. So it's nearly a year in the making. It was launched in the final few weeks of the former US President Joe Biden's administration, and it was expected that President Trump would resolve this by the findings from the U.S. Trade Representative offices that China has used aggressively and sweeping to use non-market policies to create foreign dependence on its products in a way that was not advantages for U.S. commerce. So the decision is not to impose any tariffs in the next six months, but starting from June 2027, they will impose tariffs, but rates are only going to be announced at least a month before. So this is a clear signal that President Trump is in some ways trying to stabilize ties here and keep to that tweet truce that he agreed with President Xi when they met in South Korea. But at the same time also creating that opening right to revisit this one and a half years later and potentially a bargaining chip when China and U.S. has to renegotiate the extension of the trade truce. Already, we're not even at 2026. You're taking us into mid 2027 amendment. What was China's response to this? So the US, the Chinese embassy in the US has responded and obviously hit back at this, saying that, you know, they're opposed to this and also saying that they will take whatever necessary measures to protect their legitimate rights and interests. And you can see here the statement they said to instrumentalize and weaponize trade and take issues and destabilise global industrial supply chains will benefit no one and will eventually backfire. Now, this comes as China also hit back against the new US rules to ban foreign drones and drone pods, and also saying that that the US is bullying Chinese companies, saying that China reserves the right to protect or safeguard Chinese interests and also calling on the US to withdraw those rules. Right. Thank you so much, Laura, China correspondent there. Our other top story, all the data that came through overnight in the US, obviously the headline was GDP. Within that you had several things like so the two year yield, for example, spiking a little bit. Not a lot of material pricing changes around the Fed. You have consumer confidence numbers separately also showing. Maybe the opposite, but maybe the same. Right. It's a it's a multi multifaceted coin. Consumption and exports driving us growth. On your screens, GDP, of course, coming in north of 4%. Quite a substantial beat looking at where the estimates were to just help us understand the context are guilty says our managing editor who's with us here on set up. Good set of numbers, good growth. Yeah, I mean, look, I think, you know, you're looking at GDP growing at the fastest pace in two years in the third quarter. So obviously some pretty robust figures there. But what you're really looking at here, David, is that the economy did seem to continue to build some momentum, and that's after some of the most severe of the Trump tariffs were actually lifted. So there was a little bit of a reprieve there, not really a ton of impact sort of you're seeing from, you know, some of you know, some of the some of their political issues. I think, you know, we're likely to look at is sort of that continued sort of strength as you as you start to head into 2026. I think the consumer confidence divergence, though, is quite interesting. Maybe tells you a little bit, David, about how the way that people actually spend, because, you know, part of the strength in these GDP figures was really because there was more consumer spending. But, you know, maybe there's a divergence there in how people were actually spending versus how they feel about the economy. I mean, certainly, you know, some concerns there in those consumer confidence numbers about, you know, the labour market going into 20, 26 tariffs, that kind of thing. But at least, you know, that's not showing up in the spending figures just yet. So tells you a little bit there. Yeah, just some breaking news right now. So a judge has upheld the White House's 100,000 fee on H-1B visas, of course, which is a story, of course, that made a lot of waves globally when it was first introduced out of the White House. And it seems to be that will remain the case moving forward. Jill, are you going to comment on this or should we talk about the weakness indication because we know that what it means for the Fed, it's your choice. Yeah, I think we can probably move on to the Fed has been kind of slow to digest, you know, exactly where this kind of goes in terms of the court decisions here for this visa rule. But when we're talking about the Fed here, I think some really interesting comment. Obviously, we're all kind of on tenterhooks waiting for Trump to actually announce whoever his Fed chair nominee is going to be. You've got really the latest comments from Trump. I think we're very, very, you know, in line with what we've come to expect from him, essentially saying that no matter what the economy is doing, essentially he wants whoever his Fed chair pickers who really, really rally for cutting rates, obviously, like, you know, I think some divergence there with, you know, some market fundamentals certainly over the last several decades. It's not about the economy. But I think that, you know, what we're really hearing from Trump is just that he is so adamant about wanting to have somebody in that position who is going to do what Trump wants him to do. Right. Like, I think you've got he he wants lower interest rates and he wants to install somebody that's actually going to tackle that. Of course, David, I mean, we've talked I don't even know how many times about the fact that, you know, it's obviously not just the Fed chair himself that, you know, makes those types of decisions. You know, you have to rally the rest of the FOMC around you to sort of bring something forward. But it does indicate, obviously, you know, Trump is really, really, really wants a Federal Reserve that's essentially going to do what he wants. Does he get that in 2026? I think it is. It is just one vote to the point you're making. Right. So just looking at the dots, too. Thank you so much, Jill. Fantastic. Jill, is there a managing editor now we might not even need to crowbar in lower rates, Right, because there is a case to be made for lower rates. In fact, post these numbers that that that did come out, of course, on consumer confidence, specifically our team at Bloomberg Economics. Let me just paraphrase this and shorten it quite simply. Is that because of the consumer confidence numbers in a weaker side of things, they're a function of labor market health, which is important to the Fed at this point in time. Given that mandates plural, they do expect more rate cuts, an easing in 2026. Right. Speaking of 2026, a market outlook for next year with these markets coming up here and why they think Chinese markets are just starting to win over some long, all the investor that's coming up counting down to the open of trade, Shanghai, Shenzhen and here in Hong Kong, this is the China show. Good morning. Good morning. 17 minutes to the opening bell again, a reminder that it's a shortened session here in Hong Kong today. I think we're at lunch and then, of course, that allows us to ease our way into the stillness of Christmas Eve. Well, I guess depending on what your plans are, certainly in my end, it's going to be it's going to be quiet copper on your screens, of course. And we'll talk more about the commodities rally. But certainly when you look at the commodity complex and the overlay on equity markets, resource heavy markets did also do very, very well this year. Right? Whether that's precious metals, you have copper, that's an air power play as it pertains to the air, obviously has been doing very well. A record low right now across these benchmarks. Asia Pacific, those up 3/10 of 1% this 24th of December to get an outlook for next year. Vanessa Shu is here with us on set, co-founder and CEO at VZ Partners, Hong Kong. Good morning. Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you again. America Christmas. Yes, I'll do it again. Okay. The this year has really been dollar weakness. Stocks have done well. Yes, m m has done well. Do you think m still have room to rally with against the backdrop of just things are no longer as cheap as they were at the start of the year broadly? Well, I think the m good performers will continue because of the fundamentals are driving earnings expansions and driving credit expansions when dollar is going to a easing cycle regardless of, you know, how much and how fast and out of that cuts. Well provide a liquidity support. And the DM market, particularly the US economy is healthy albeit to some cyclical slowdown. So so that provides the demand support for the market. And you know, there is a difference of this growth cycle, which is it is the DM, particularly the US debt has undergone massive expansion on infrastructural constructions of, you know, manufacturing sites, data centers and an expansion in industrial assets and a rebuild capital formation. So that's going to have a demand effect on the EAME supplies. So exports are going to stay healthy, which, you know, the supply from industrial will turn that into consumer spending. Power grows, wage growth in middle income households and wallets and growing. So that's going to provide a fundamental healthy support for. M What if the Fed what is the Fed doesn't cut any more? What if what if they've ended it? Even if the Fed doesn't cut? I think, you know, the we have posted the peak rates perhaps. Right. And inflation expectation has been so far well anchored. Even if the Fed doesn't cut the US fiscal expansion is there and the liquidity is changing from, you know, monetary liquidity that flows into the financial markets, to fiscal liquidity that flows into the real, real industries, to the main street rather than Wall Street. Right? So Wall Street is asset price inflation and Main Street is a real economy expansion, which is going to support demand. I think also the DM has to survive. The PE creates a balance sheet, has been improving, profitability has been solid and cash flow has been solid after corporates has survived of the of the of the PE career to remember two or three years ago we were worried about the debt refinancing was that the cooperative couldn't survive the post-COVID post-COVID world and you have to we had at the peak rates so that and bankruptcy did not go up. Yeah and corporates have fundamental research has survived that cash flow around the price of profitability below. Okay. So that's going to support the M demand. For example, you know, India is perhaps a lagging in the, you know, M with the size, but fundamentally I think India will be picking up in terms of less restrictive of a regulatory environment, more liquidity, because the central bank has cut and the solid households consumption grows. But but India, just to play the devil's advocate, has underperform. For him this year because it neither has a strong air component in the market, nor does it have, nor is it a very resource heavy index, for example. Right, right. So that's the case for India. The two prominent sectors performed very well that India is relatively weaker, but fundamentally, India is at that credit expansion cycle. Is that infrastructure building cycle, the housing market, which an economy housing market is a pillar for the for the economy. After ten years of a down cycle, India as a housing market is booming. Therefore, it will have a, you know, impact on consumption, impact on construction, impact on, you know, durable goods such as the cars and appliances, etc.. So the fundamental has been there. I think MSCI India's earnings growth has been revised up and the financial sector, industrial sector and has been doing very well. So maybe next year. I think India is a is a is a worse look on a relative a value basis. And particularly given the other market has gone up pretty a bit in market. Can I ask you about China? Sure. There's a big swing in attitude from this, an investable tag to certainly a lot of global investors have not only increased allocations, they've asked they've at least explicitly talked about wanting to also increase their allocations even further. There's still question marks. Yes, I think the point you made and I think the point you're making is China does not have to be in a bull market. It just doesn't need we just don't want to be in a bear market. As things stand, you see more allocations going into China next year, even if the macro stays the same. Well, you mentioned one thing, but one thing and the doing there is a gap. So when the mind to begin to change, it takes time, particularly for large, very fundamental lam money to realize perhaps the risk allocation was too bearish and too little for China to actually add a you know, I see or see out office level to change the risk allocation and take actions. All of that takes time. So I think China rebounded the sense that September 24 last year. So it's slightly more than a year and that ended the export industrial compound remained remained healthy, although domestic economy still have some headwinds. So it has triggered the people to deeply rethink about geoeconomics, a rethink about how to look at a China as a fundamentals. And and that takes time I think as long as next year. It is not a bear market that even if it doesn't, the market doesn't go up as much. It will have a and people will allocate it to China more particularly in a broader context. As we mentioned the M still, this is the logic is the GM component and the for sizable capital to deploy to GM, china has to be a you know, Moscow. Is it a better play next year do you think? Is it a benchmark play China I think it's a it's an alpha play. So look at the economy. There is a buy faction. Advanced industrials are cheap, making the semiconductor related to value chains are doing very well. It will continue to do well. And we see a very healthy and strong high quality pipelines of IP also coming to Hong Kong or domestic market for them or for that matter. But on the other side, the consumption remains still, you know, a little bit weak and real estate continue to have dragging, in fact, on the traditional economies, too. So it's a it's a also alpha market for stock pickers. And it's it's a play mainly in Hong Kong because Hong Kong has had, to your point, massive IPOs this year. It's been a very, very good year. And I think you think the world under appreciates the fact that the market structure in Hong Kong is changing Correct. And the market structure trend in meaning that, you know, Hong Kong used to be perceived as, you know, massive state owned companies, the traditional banks and and insurances. And the Hong Kong is lacking innovation and innovation goes to a stop order in China in Shenzhen. But now look at Hong Kong. It has a very well-rounded industry combination of the new issuances and the reassurances. So you can find the leadership almost across board of all industries. So so the innovation force is driving the Hong Kong IPO market to end. The world has not to realize the data. Give it another year. To the world where it will not stand a very strongly. The Hong Kong market structure has fundamentally changed. Okay. Yeah, we we're out of time. We didn't get to talk about private credit alternatives and fixed income. No doubt we'll have more time for that next year. Vanessa, very nice to see you. Very nice to see you, too. A merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mary Kay. Hi to the team for us as well. Vanessa Schuh, their co-founder and CEO at VZ Partners here in Hong Kong. We are flat on a Hang Seng at the open A50. Futures are down about a quarter of 1%. Plenty more heads. A preview of the session. This is the China show. Good morning. Right. Welcome back. Going into the open today. So the seven level on the currency, we're close. It will need to be a fairly statistical aberration esque date to take us below seven. On Dollar China, we'll talk about Sihanouk and MGM China in a moment. We've talked at length already about precious metals. There's a seven year bond. I think it's 8 billion renminbi today and of course, early closed. So we open at nine and then I think we shot at 12. So 3 hours for today. All that is to say it doesn't even matter if the market is open. Right, because investors have largely checked out. So we talked about falling vol and turnover, 15 day moving average on a Hang Seng index turnover charts coming up on your screens Green circle well Christmas theme right green circle is the was the peak this year that's the deep sneak moment from that low and red is where we are and we're at the lowest level at going back to about the start of the deep signalman, right almost come full circle on turnover. But again, on price itself, we are we're certainly holding up near the higher end of this year's range. And Hang Seng index, in fact is on a very note. Have a look at where we are here. $26 in, let's call it that Hang Seng Tech on your screens, dollar China and Hang Seng China. So we're slightly and I'm being generous clearly going into the the open today. The opening bell coming up next. 3 minutes away. This is the China show. Good morning. Right. Each and every day, while not each and every day. Let's call it more. More often than not. You know, I get reminders of how blessed I am to be covering a region as diverse as the Asia Pacific. While we were looking at Japan for potential intervention, we were looking at China for a potential break of seven. What happened was the Koreans came out and gave us those conversations to have separately. But yet that is just to say, of course, lots of stories to get into as we wrap up. Even a very, very quiet session in the equity markets is a massive move down in dollar one today. We were, I think 1.3, 1.4% to the downside there on dollar one. Okay. That is also to say that it has been a outside of that. It's been a it's been a weak dollar story going into that one story this morning. Dollar's weaker, a third day. You had the fix in at 701. I've talked about this in case you missed that, that's about a one Sigma move away on a daily basis that takes us below seven. That doesn't seem to be anything on the agenda. Clearly, we don't know what we don't know, but doesn't seem to be anything that is visible that might act as a catalyst for a one Sigma move down in Dollar China today, as you look at the bond yields and as we changed a page, just a reminder that we have a seven year CGP auction today. Keep an eye on that 88 billion me on offer tend to 1% of the upside just 200 short of the 2600 level on the Hang Seng index. It's quite as far as sector news. There's chips and of course there's drones, which I think we can get to later on as far as the movers go. Obviously, precious metals, that's a separate but related stories. See NOOK is up 3/10 of 1%. Another oil discovery in the Bohai Sea. Not much reaction in the market today one debut coming through ding bought Jan sent on your screens were up 200 plus percent. Beyond that, I can't tell you more really that's a first day of trade so let's put the page please. But suffice to say it's another good day, good trading day. Blue chip stocks in focus. There we go, SMI c up 4.3, while Hong is up about 4%. This has been a fairly consistent move, by the way, since the more threads unveiling their new product on the weekend and that we talked about gold right 4500s on spot silver is up 7172 so it about 70% Silver's up by double Jiangxi copper 1.4%. Putting everything together as far as the copper story is concerned, 12%, 12,000. Iron, copper. There we go. Thank you. 12 one And of course, also, I think we're at 90,000 on a Shanghai contract. Let's bring in our cross assets. Reporter Richard Henderson. He's in Melbourne for us today. Richard, good morning, sir. Thank you for coming on the show. Cross It has been a very busy, busy area this year. Take your pick. Where do we start going into next year? What's top of mind for you, sir? I think stocks is a great place to start. You know, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up 27% for the year so far when you include dividends. And part of it is a dollar story. You know, weakening dollar does flatter some of those returns. But I think underlying that is a great technology story and it really is easy to point to deep sea at the start of the year that showed investors and it comes up all the time when I'm talking to chief investment officers and portfolio managers in the region. It really underscored the type of possibilities and talent that's on offer in China, but also in places like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, where from a hardware and software point of view, it's so tightly integrated into the global technology supply chain and often at a far greater, more attractive valuation, let's say, than the United States. And we see those persistent concerns around the max seven valuation story, for instance. So I think going into 2026, we're going to see investors really like to to build out their tech exposure in Asia, to build on some of those gains and to potentially try and serve up the AI theme at a cheaper price point, basically. Yeah, If you just got out, you don't need to look cross. I said just look across the Pacific And any concerns over valuations, you know, after, you know, after a year and let's take Korea obviously isn't a very extreme example because I think that is the best performing index. And a lot of that has to do with high index and Samsung beneath the hood. After a year that after a year like Korea has had. Are there concerns over market concentration or valuations within that space? Just to maybe just close the door on that on that one? Definitely, Yeah. Those concerns are going to be very key to the to the, you know, the investment thesis for those single names and for the index. But I think we're not really seeing the same levels as we're seeing in the US where, you know, the Mag seven is some 33% of the S & P 500. Now, you know that that makes the, you know, the index so vulnerable to such a few companies. There's also great earnings underpinning some of these supplies in Asia. So so I think given that attractiveness of valuation relative to the US and other global peers, investors will still see a lot of value through through Asia Tech. So I expect that to continue into the new year. Okay. What about credit, sir? What's top of mind going into next year? Credit. Credit, Yeah. Investment grade dollar credit in Asia is heading for its best year since 2019. It's outperformed the US. It's a great, great year for Asia credit. And part of this is, you know, not not a huge gluts of supply and also pretty pretty attractive on the defaults, you know, very low defaults. So, you know, when we talk to portfolio managers, they really like Asia credit at that at that investment grade level. But also high yields had a great had a great year relative to the US. I think it's you know best year in seven from memory so so yeah Asia credit still very attractive and again it's you know it's partly reflecting the relative attractiveness to its global peers. But I think another another strong year for credit potentially in 2026. The it's quite an equity markets and now the news flow keeps keeps giving and I think that you know the Koreans we talked about this and I'm not sure if you heard the what happened there. Of course, the Bank of Korea just now talking about how the NPS was activated, new strategic effect hedging. But just to say, of course, very, very strong language coming through out of Korean authorities on the currency markets. What's obviously against the backdrop of a very weak dollar this year, does the weak dollar continue next year? And how what does that how does it activate regulators that might be maybe too worried over a too weak dollar, for example, or the opposite in the case I guess of of of of the Koreans. Exactly. And you can point to Japan as well. We had comments this week from the finance minister, I believe, reminding the market about the ability for official intervention. Listen, I think because of the Federal Reserve cuts that are forecast in the year ahead, we're going to see a pretty, pretty sort of persistent weakness in the outlook for the dollar. And again, relative to some of those Asian, Asian central banks, Australia and New Zealand, Japan, that are now shifting or already in a tightening cycle that will support their currencies. I think the yen, the dollar weakness trade should should endure until we start to see a shift in in US inflation or jobs. Richard. Fantastic. Thank you, sir. Richard henderson there in oz for us across assets. Reporter. Just very briefly, you know, for many people sorry, may be the hardest word. Not for us. We're sorry we made a mistake. The graphic that we showed you earlier on the show. Silver was up 400%. That did look kind of sketchy, though, to begin with. There's the correct graphic for you. Year to date, that's what we're doing in Silver gold spot and also copper. But you know what? Just to say, it's been a good year still. Right? Okay. Plenty more ahead. This is the China show. Welcome back. You watching the China show? Let's talk about strategic investments, talk about ports. Right. So China's invested, what, billions, billions and billions of dollars really in building ports right around the globe here, giving Beijing a strategic advantage given the trade and tensions conversation. It's breaking security, current concerns as well around the world. And our team at Bloomberg Originals, in fact, has taken a closer look at this trend. Every year, China imports about 66,000 metric tons of these. That's the weight of about six and a half Persian landmarks, or if you like, 440 blue whales. And most of these avocadoes come all the way from Peru. This journey used to take over a month. Now it's a straight shot cut in it by ten days. Why? One word, Megaport. And it's paid for by China. Chinese President Xi Jinping begins a week long South America tour, opening a China funded megaport in Peru. This is a huge investment not only for Peru but in Latin America. And it is expected to triple agricultural exports of Peru over the last 20 years. China has built up a network of about 100 ports on every continent except Antarctica, clustered around key maritime choke points, which are crucial to global trade. This gives China a strategic advantage as global trade tensions rise. But it's also sparking concerns, even though these ports, by and large, commercial ports, some of them do actually have the capacity to host naval vessels. So why did China build a global ports empire? And should Washington be worried about it? Without ports, the global economy pretty much grinds to a halt. Roughly about 80% of global trade is conducted via ships, and ports are crucial to that. Six of the ten busiest ports in the world are located in China. And 95% of the nation's trade is done by sea. China has made itself rich by being able to find markets overseas for its manufactured goods and being able to ship raw materials to China to be processed. So making sure that it has access to a network of global ports is a key part of that. And it's not only ports. China is also the world's biggest maker of container ships, making these generational investments to dominate global trade infrastructure. It's a central pillar of the Belt and Road Initiative. Over the years, it has become President Xi Jinping's signature global initiative, with the goal to strengthen or improve global connectivity through building up infrastructure projects. This has meant modernizing the ancient Silk Road with highways and rail, while securing maritime pathways in and out of China. Since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese entities investment in overseas ports have accelerated both in terms of scale and numbers. This map shows Chinese entities have invested in 129 port projects, totalling over $60 billion from Tanzania and Australia to Nigeria and Cambodia. This dwarfs investments made by any other country. There is no US government initiative that tries to finance or build port projects overseas. China has an entire ecosystem of companies from cement firms, iron steel firms that specialize in building out ports. Those are not industries where the U.S. has been focused in recent years. But the level of Chinese ownership over its ports varies. China's global network is made up of a series of different forms of ownership by Chinese state run companies and also Chinese private companies. In most cases, they team up with multinational or local companies to build and run the ports, even though the land is still owned by local governments. 17 of the ports China has invested in have majority Chinese ownership, which could offer Beijing more leverage at those sites, such as prioritizing container ships from a certain country or denying the docking of ships from other countries. But China has little reason to disrupt global trade. Which takes us back to the first megaport we mentioned at Junkee in Peru. 60% is owned by China's state run shipping company COSCO, and 40% by an entity controlled by an Argentine investor. Chiang Guy is located around 40 miles north of Lima, and in its final phase, the main area of the ports is expected to be around 700 acres, which is about 80% the size of Central Park. So the port itself is huge. This port is part of China's large infrastructure push in Latin America. Currently, three out of four of the biggest economies of South America, a trade war with China than the U.S.. In fact, a third of all the containers exported by Peru are sent to China, carrying not only these favorites, but other agricultural products and minerals as well. So this makes Peru a crucial gateway into China for Brazil, Chile and other countries. The initial investment was of $1.3 billion. But if there's more demand, Costco has said that it could invest $3.5 billion total for an expansion of the port. Chiang Kai is a deep water port, which means that shipments can take place directly from Shanghai to major Chinese ports. So that would enable journeys to be cut down, costs to be reduced, trade to be increased between South America and China. US officials have criticized this for telling Peruvian authorities that they should not have allowed a Chinese firm to create such a big investment in the region. But Peruvian officials have countered, saying that the US hasn't been willing to make such a big investment in Peru. As we know by now, this is not just a story about overseas investment. It's also about national security. A number of Trump officials have even suggested that the port could be dual use, meaning that at some stage it could be used not just for economic activity, but for military activity, too. That's something that Peruvian officials strongly deny and that China denies, too. But these concerns are not unfounded. Well, U.S. intelligence says China's first overseas military base in the tiny African country of Djibouti is likely to be followed by several more in Djibouti. What began as a commercial port eventually turned into China's first full fledged overseas military base. Remember this map of the 17 ports with Chinese majority ownership, 14 have potential for both commercial and military use, meaning it can a service of commercial ships, LNG tankers, oil tankers. And it might also have the physical capacity to host fueling ships, logistics, ships for military purposes or a military battleship. China only has one overseas naval base so far as compared to the several that the US has dotted around the world. In fact, the U.S. also has a naval base in Djibouti, along with at least 127 other overseas military bases. Chinese officials strongly denied that the ports are for military use. But still, many countries around the world are concerned that these Chinese port operators could in turn become listening posts to what the economies that are surrounding these ports are doing. But the more immediate concern is that China could leverage these ports in a trade war. China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back. For the U.S. the Panama Canal is really a crucial economic lifeline. Something like 5% of global trade travels through the canal and 40% of U.S. contain the traffic flows through it. Without that ability to easily pass between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans through that corridor, U.S. trade will be very much impacted. Two of the ports on either side of the canal are owned by Hong Kong based conglomerate S.K. Hutchison. To all intents and purposes, Beijing doesn't have direct control over Hutchinson. But the very fact that the key executives at these companies may have direct relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, that really makes a lot of Western governments uncomfortable. A foreign power today possesses through their companies, which we know are not independent. The ability to turn the canal into a choke point, and that is a direct threat to the national interests and security of the United States. China has said that it has always respected Panama's sovereignty over the canal and that it firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices. Yet it has also pushed back against a deal that would give control of Hutchinson's Panama ports to American asset manager BlackRock, calling the deal a betrayal of national interests. The European Union has introduced investment screening regulations which make it much more difficult for China to buy out critical infrastructure, including ports across the continent. A tit for tat over docking fees has also been rippling through the shipping industry. Washington has also suggested that all this Chinese money comes with heavy strings attached. But if you talk to officials in Nigeria, Peru, beyond, there's a feeling that, look, we need this infrastructure. It's important for our economic modernization plans. And China is the only game in town offering it. Ultimately, we're going to see a reshaping of global trade flows because maritime trade has become more and more political. Enjoy that. Yeah, fantastic stuff. And work, of course, out of our team at Bloomberg Originals as subscribers, by the way, can watch that specific one and others, of course, on the terminal it's also on the website on Bloomberg dot com. China has certainly emerged as one of the key markets this year. That's imports do of course catch and read up on sure these call them today a fantastic one. Repeat after me. Never ever underestimate China of course in terms of what happened this year. Trade war, air developments, everything in between. The latest article in Focus is on why one should not undertake that exercise. You can read about that on terminals. Well also on the Bloomberg dot com. Right. Welcome back, Chips and Focus. Well, a couple of things is obviously. One is the US has, at least for now, pushed back the prospect of duties and that following, of course, the review. The second one comes down to what the security news reported late last night. And also, as you might see, in fact, raising some prices, some products by 10%. More on those stories coming through in the next hour of the China show. Welcome back. You're watching a China show half an hour into the Twas the Night Before Christmas, as they say. And certainly volumes are screaming that fact out when you look at turnover turning down volumes at this point in time of the day, we're about 48% lighter than than the month's average. Price swings are obviously going to be exacerbated. But that's just to say, of course, markets have effectively checked out for for the year. And it's been a really, really, really good year to be long. Major assets like stocks, precious metals. We get into all of that, of course, in the next hour of the China show. And of course, Bill is standing by in Sydney for us to help drive the ship in the next hour. Bell drive the ship for the last show before Christmas. And definitely here in Australia people have well and surely clocked off by now. But we are going to be bringing you all of the market moves over the coming hours and just starting us off in the session today. I mean it's it's pretty strong and and we have really eventually got that Santa Claus rally, it seems, just given what we had on Wall Street. It's translated eventually across to the Asian benchmarks in this session, with the exception actually of the ASX 200 standing out to the downside this morning. But it is that continued theme you see around tech, in particular metals and Vietnamese stocks. We're also tracking those ASX. You get the Vietnamese stocks first because as you were saying, Dave, I saw your email you sent earlier, this is by far the best performing benchmark globally. Over the past few weeks you're seeing gains of around 7%. But even in the session today, very strong moves and this is really perhaps a little bit more political clarity coming to the fore here because we may be soon set to get a new picture, a clear picture of the new top leaders for the country as well. Metals, as I mentioned, because very strong moves across the board in in the likes of copper, palladium, platinum, rather silver, gold. I mean you're seeing platinum record highs, silver above $70 an ounce at 4500 on gold spot as well, copper about 1200 thousand a tonne for the first time ever. Very strong moves really with these expectations around Fed easing into next year. There are some tariff risks as well that are coming to the fore, particularly for those copper prices but also taking a look in the currency space because again, as you said, Dave, you get that seen in trading, it leaves you open maybe to some more stronger moves. And the Korean one is maybe reflecting a bit of that today, but it is strengthening. And that's after authorities said excessive weakness in the currency is not desirable. So some strong determination to act. I mean, we didn't we just got that early this week as well with from the finance minister in Japan. But certainly you have those government officials in North Asia prepared to step in. Absolutely. In fact, Mark Cranfield is standing by for us to help us understand the context here in terms of what's happening broadly, of course, risk assets. And we talked about the markets and the complications suddenly of us looking elsewhere. Mark, we were talking about the we were looking elsewhere for intervention. Japan is a good example. We were talking about seven on the Chinese currency. And then the Koreans came out and said, hey, look at us. How do we need to be looking at this risk? Well, the Korean timing is very clever indeed, because they obviously were waiting to some extent for a for a change in the Japanese currency. The two are usually pretty closely linked together. So since we've already had Katayama, the finance minister, helping the yen to get a little bit stronger, the Korean authorities are following up. And the timing is also good because if you look at the the performance of the dollar against the Korean one over the past year, you'll see that when it gets close to the 1480 kind of area, which it is approaching today, that's a pretty important pivot area. And if they had allowed it just to drift even beyond that, by the time we come back in January, we could have a very weak currency indeed. And it might be beyond their control to do anything about it. So very important that they step in when they did. And if you look at the measures that they've announced today, that the key one is the one that's aimed at individual investors, there's been there's been talk for quite a while. The Koreans have been sending a lot of money to the US to buy tech stocks in America. It seems that the individuals in Korea, they love American big tech names, people like Tesla and India, all those kind of players. And there is so much money stored up in the US dollar via the equity market, the Korean authorities, and now encourage them to bring it back to Korea and do so at advantageous levels as well. So clearly it is very much aimed at getting money back into Korea to support the Korean currency. So very good timing from their point of view. So the chances of them drawing a line under the weakness in the currency is pretty good as they go into year end, and they should be able to start the new year on a much better footing than they would have done if they just allowed it to drift around. Let's talk about, I guess, some other implications of that weaker dollar story as well, because you've got gold that's about 4500 an ounce for the first time. What does that tell you and what's the direction for metals going into next year? Because a lot of these moves, I mean, again, at record levels. Yeah. I mean, that's a that's a double edged thing there. So General, US dollar weakness usually is good for precious metals, especially gold, but you're seeing it branch out way beyond this going into, as you say, into silver, platinum and other places as well. So on the one side is a dollar story, but on the other side, clearly geopolitics is playing a pretty big role as well. The fact that the United States and Venezuela, the situation there is pretty tense, could even deteriorate further. People are concerned about that. I think you still got a lot of unresolved issues in other parts of the world. There seems to be no sign that Russia and Ukraine are going to have a truce there either. So there's plenty of reasons when you look across the world, if people want to be nervous, if they want to be defensive, then obviously going into gold and other places is pretty good. And then you get the double whammy effect because the dollar is falling as well. And in the background, the treasury curve is pretty stable. And one of the few things that can derail the gold rally would be if suddenly we get a big jump in Treasury yields. That doesn't seem to be happening right now. People still think the Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates again next year. So all the conditions are very much in favor of gold and silver, staying on a pretty good track for the time being. Mark, I'm just taking a look at crypto prices and Bitcoin in particular. It's actually pretty incredible given all the optimism we had around crypto going into 2025 and the expectations of where it would end the year, it's actually managed to go lower by around 8%. What does that mean? I think if you if you've been following what we're saying on Markets Live for the past few months, crypto is a side story. I think people there's enough happening in major currencies, inequities in global fixed income markets. There's enough asset classes which are looking very, very interesting. Crypto is a sideshow. People are just moving their money away from it. It's increasingly becoming less relevant to what happens in the other markets. It's no longer really across asset story. It's out there on its own. There are people that like crypto. They want to be involved. The read across for other major assets is becoming less and less all the time. So with that background you can have crypto continuing to slide lower. And frankly, bond traders have exchanges. They don't really care. Really great love that mark that was out in life strategies that mark rounds out Cranfield rather in Singapore and I think just saying that there's a lot more interesting asset classes to attract leads us perfectly into our guest we've got Masahiko Lui joining us senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors Semester. I mean you just heard Mark telling us straight, there's there's just too many more captivating stories in in markets to grab traders and investors. What's most interesting for you in the fixed income space. I think fixed income space, right, is a Korean income story. We have seen a lot of, you know, sell off in fixed income, especially at the market. And e market, too, is a pretty interesting place to be for next year. And then there's a lot of talks about diversifying away, not divestment, again, from U.S. Treasuries right into different parts of the world. We have, you know, m as a substitute. We have seen investors, you know, willing to go. You have been investors trying to move in to a bit of foreign flows into JGBs actually lately. So I think you are going to next year fixed income is still a carry and income story and then with yield at this elevated level, I think it's a good entry point for investors with a long term investment perspective. So we're setting out maybe for a bit softer dollar story as well. What does that tell you about the preference for fit in versus down? I think for M market, you know, if you look at the total return year to date item, local currency has returned around 18% this year, one eight 18%. And if you look at something like global act, right, what we're aggregating throughout probably 8%, which is more carry and roll. And the reason why, you know, m local debt has outperformed is because of the all the weakness. We do think that, you know, with a slightly dovish fit into next year, we etc. we actually had a pretty consensus call of for cuts in 24 and 25. We had three cuts. This is from our chief economist Simona based in Boston. She had a pretty good call this year right. Despite all the ups and downs in the market where people pull back that rate cuts forecast, we stuck we stuck to our guns and then into next year we do forecast, you know, 2 to 3 more cuts off from the fat, you know, and that will probably impart a slightly weaker, you know, US dollar, maybe 5 to 7% weaker from here. And I think in the world, you know where you have Goldilocks growth and then a slightly weaker dollar and that will actually benefit him local currency debt as a whole, especially when you know a lot of this global investors, remember, they are very, very they are still underweight, you know, under emerging market debt. So it is an asset class that is underground. It pays high real yield. And then, you know, that's more room to appreciate versus the US dollar. Fantastic myself. Of course, we'll have more from Masahiko Lu in a moment there. We've largely had a look back at this year and sees some mighty supports some of the areas of the market that he likes going into next year. We're underweight globally, of course, as you can see across the fixed income space, high yield has done better than most. Does that continue to be the case in 2026? More on the outlook coming up next. This is the China shop. All right. Welcome back. You're watching the China Show, our final full broadcast, by the way, of the year. So it's Christmas. And let me let me find a way to crowbar my favorite Christmas movie of all time. And the conversations around to Fed. Might more FOMC members turn out to be doves? Actually. Masahiko Lu is still with us, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors Mazda. Thanks for sticking around. I think you just mentioned in the previous segment two or three rate cuts for next year. Almost everywhere has done well across the fixed income space, high yield and everything in between. When you look at consensus right now and you look at what markets most people are expecting, what could go wrong? I think next year, you know, the things that might go wrong is, you know, we do have like a bubble burst, albeit this is not our base scenario. Theme for next year is uncomfortably bullish. So we are still alone in risk assets and we do want to have some hedge do right. So if you have that, you know, a small bubble burst or we call it a momentum crash rather than burst. And and then there's also talks about your own carry treatment and one which is I don't think we will see that we might see a bit of, you know, periodically volatility but it's not the system is systemic or structural risk that that policy. So if we do have that, you know, small turmoil in the market, that's when, you know, risk assets will do worse. Right. And then that's when know hedges will come in and do well. And that's why we have seen investors, you know, locking into having traits that, you know, they are long risk like equities. And then, you know, if you long see, for instance, the short end of the US curve is a pretty good player. If, you know, risks plunge and fat wall will cut. Right. So that's a pretty good place to be for fixed income has its place, albeit not in the longer and a curve but the short end of the curve. And how does asset class or you know like fixed income that's has cheapened up a lot like GBS for instance. Right. If you do have a change in sentiment, I think that, you know, rewind that reversal would be pretty quick. And also, you know, you can sit on assets like, hey, just like gold, you know, and convertible bonds, right? We have seen actually investors, especially in the in European investors taking chips off a bit, you know, when it comes to US equities, right. Growth equities. And then if you are in converts, you do have that upside in equities and also you do have a downside protection of a bond. Like that's a tough time protection, right? So that's why we have seen, you know, a lot of industrials trying to have have hedges on. What fantastic advice, I think. Can I just pick up on one of the points you just made? It's the short end. So I think we've seen three straight years of the US curve specifically steepening. Do you see anything that upsets that, that that trend is are we going to get a fourth year steepening? I think we will get a fourth year of steepening into next year. You know, albeit, you know, a flattening is probably more of a 2027 story. Right. Even in Japan is the flattening is going to be a late 20, 26 story. But I think, you know, globally, you still have a lot of fiscal slippage and a lot of issuance in the longer end of the curve. You know, that be us Germany, including Japan's euro where I sit in. Right. And that's why we think that the curve is remains distorted albeit you know there's a lot of fixes or like tweaks being done. You know like you know you can cut a bit of the issuance on the back and issue more you know in the bill strikes or cut coupons and issue bills. A lot of this you know technical things can happen that could contain the steepness of the curve. But, you know, in general sense, I think a lot of people aren't comfortable sitting on a shot and then having to price a bit of term premium into the longer end. Yeah, I guess that's also a reflection around the yield curve outlook, just as of a lot of the spending that's tied to the big, beautiful bill that's going to kick in. And a lot of what we see in terms of CapEx investments as well as an investor in more of the corporate space. Is there any concern about some of those those bonds that are tied to air specifically? Sure. At State Street Investment management, you know, we actually we favor sovereign bonds over credit for the next year. Right. The reason why is because, you know, we have seen a lot of issuance, you know, funding aspiration of HYPERSCALERS in CapEx. And that will I think will drive, you know, spreads higher into next year, especially focusing on the type names that will basically drive, you know, spreads when it comes to like for instance, US IG rate is trading around 80 basis points, 75, 80 basis points at almost at all time tight. Right. We think, you know, the general travel direction of travel is to get spread a bit wider maybe, you know, 200, 120 when it comes to high yield, it's trading at 25 currently is also at all times tight. So, you know, there's only so much, you know, room for it to rally from here further to tighten further. So we do think that, you know, if we do have a bit of more cockroaches in the market per se and then more issuance, that will basically put on some pressure in the credit market. So we are favoring sovereign debt over credit and then we also favor M local that and other, you know, hedges like coal and converts. What about the the Japan debt market as well because I can see in your notes is saying JGBs look pretty cheap but sentiment does still remain pretty cautious as well. This is something very interesting talking to foreign investors. So me sitting in Japan so I cover impact on do travel to you know in the US and Europe from time to time talking to investors. You know, you have seen two types of investors right. Domestic and foreign foreign investors, they are getting more attracted to GGP market, albeit a lot of the money that flows into Japan from foreign is still in the fast money or you know that the ones that are active more tactical type of investors. We do sense that you know there's more and more of this the real real money right there, like the likes of the sovereign wealth funds, like your pension funds in the U.S.. Right. That has never been looking at JGB for the past three years because it's going at 0% right now. Suddenly it's yielding at par with Germany 30 years. Right. And then if you're a foreign investor, as you head you back to, you know, your foreign your own currency, home currency, you actually get the hedging premium, which is around one 200 to 200 basis points, you know, of of of attractiveness. And as a domestic investor in Japan, no one wants to catch a falling. Naturally, Japan banks are sitting on a lot of cash, ¥400 trillion of cash. Right. Those are the money that will be deployed in the job market. But speaking to investors in Japan, we have started to see this pick up of up interest. But then it is going to take a long, drawn process. You know, they have to wait until BOJ gets to closer to the terminal, which is we think round one 125 by early 2027. So, you know JGB that you get the structural buying from Japanese investors will be a 2026 later health story but you know before we get there you know a lot of entry points for investors to to to to get in when especially when the market you know GGP market sell off under a headline of increase issuance of fiscal slippage for us we think that you know Takeuchi if she has a choice I don't think she wants to be distressed right. I think she's going to be. MALONEY Like, you know how Italy has outperformed the market. I'm going I'm coming into this several quarters. Yeah, that seems to be an easy, easy choice of preference, let's put it that way. Can I just I mean, perfect, perfect segue way for. The JGB market, the KGB's. So obviously we've seen this yield yields cross because of the sort of Japan normalizing interest rates, the lack of inflation in China on our screens for our viewers. Must you say 2026 will be will be the becomes the verdict year on China's ability to exit deflation? Two part question Do you think they will exit deflation? And if they do, what's the trade? And by the way, third question why 2026? I think 25 freight has seen, you know, like look at the chart. Right. This is pretty surprising. I like to me is a Baltic expression. Baltic Chinese yield is trading underneath Japan. Right. Jiji It's actually doing one two GBS right. And I think 23 five is the year that, you know, investors have shifted away from thinking this segment of Asia is actually Japan for the past 30 years. Right now, once you know Japanese yield is next, nothing right now Japan is actually doing a lot better. There's a lot of foreign inflows in both JGBs and also Nikkei equities. Right. And if you talk to a lot of foreign investors, they are very actually pretty bullish when it comes to Japan, especially when it comes to macro growth and stuff. But shifting to China, I think, you know, is actually there's a lot of similarities, a bit of differences between Japan and China and what sitting in China, I'm looking at I'm sorry, sitting in Japan looking at China, I could see China is mimicking Japan back in the 1990, early 2000, right where Japan was in the early stage in this was going to last decades, I think 2026 is the verdict year because, you know, we have seen China's inflation improving a bit. Right. But still, you know, is still in a deflationary stage. And there's a lot of targeted spending, targeted growth initiatives done by the government. And 2026, you know, if anything we think is going to be a pivot in a year for them, if they could actually actually deflation and also induce a bit of growth in the market into its economy. But, you know, having putting every piece into the puzzle, we do think that, you know, trying to asset is still a pretty is is going to take a pretty long time for China right to to actually actually exit that whole deflationary and also growth on the mining mindset just because of how look in Japan right you have the demographics aging society and you have elevated debt And then the third one is, you know, secular decline in potential growth. China is doing better than Japan, right? Because they do have, you know, 45% potential growth. But then, you know, is there will be a lot of pressure, external pressure, too, on China. And we think that, you know, CGP is actually attractive trade to be whenever there is a sell off taking you know from the experience of Japan and Jeju market. Thank you, sir. Have a good rest of your week and holidays ahead myself. Masahiko Lu, the senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Tokyo, writes, We'll leave you with a look at markets and then we'll see you on the other side of this break. Welcome back. And some of the corporate stories that we're tracking this morning. We're watching Senate shares. That's after it announced a major oilfield discovery in the Bohai Sea. Sinovac says that Qinhuangdao 29, Dash six, holds 100 million tons of oil with the discovery well producing 2500 barrels of crude a day. China's Comac is set to miss its annual delivery target for a sea 919 single aisle jet by almost 50%. Data from Cirium and plane spotters dot net suggest Comac shipped just 13 of its flagship plane this year, well short of the target of 25 Planemakers expected to have received the SI 919 this year, including Air China and China Eastern. All right. Let's have a look at these markets. Chips and focus SMI here the news yesterday out of the that's near these times and that dovetails really into the well the well first the jump in the shares clearly and some prices and some products by 10% make the entry model Qualcomm. Sam is also on the up here, 1.2%. Taiwanese insurers also in focus today on the back of some changes in, I guess effects and that should be leading to some gains not all but we are coming off highs, if not completely reversing in some cases on some changes in accounting rules. Right. We'll take a short break and have a look at the Japanese. Close the market close in a moment. This is Bloomberg. It's 11:29 a.m. in Tokyo this morning. Japanese markets just about to go into their lunch break. We're not really seeing too much trading activity and we're seeing holiday thin trading across the board. No surprises. Why? Of course, it is Christmas Eve, but still, we are just seeing stocks inching marginally higher and that's after we had some pretty strong GDP figures out of the US overnight. That set us up nicely and played in again to that Wall Street session. Asian markets as well. Let's take a look at what's happening across the board today. As we said, it's it's very light in terms of of news stories, but still it's just some incremental moves here to the upside, still seeing that continued outperformance of tech there. And of course, the commodities rally is the other big story that we're tracking here, Dave. Yeah, it really is. In fact, we're going to get into that in a moment. I would really you know, as recently as a few weeks back, I thought we were kind of done with the rally. And then the last week happened and, you know, here we are, 45 and gold, 4500 silver, 72, platinum, copper, 12,000 of equity markets. Just very quickly, of course, in case you want to take if you're keeping tabs, best year since these years on your screens. Clearly, the Cosbys had a standout year. I think it's the best performing major benchmark globally and yet they're clearly the best on price this this this this century. In fact, the and the rethinking of its role specifically not so much as a tech play. That's been a that's been a consistent theme for for many years with the page but as a really vital cog to the air supply chain. God there we go. It's been you know, the fact that you have an underperformer, that the fact that gold has seen 50 record highs and it's still one of the underperformance relative to others like Silver just tells you how good, how good things have really been. BELL Yeah. And let's get more on that gold story. And commodities generally bring in our Bloomberg Metals and Mining reporter Martin Ritchie in Shanghai. So, Martin, was this something you had thought would be the case, would see 40 $500 an ounce by the end, by the end of the year? And and how does that set us up into next year when you still got more bullish calls saying 4840 900 is even possible. Yeah, it's been a pretty spectacular year for for gold. And since you asked for that. One of my colleagues was mentioning this morning that when he covered gold, you know, you could never imagine prices this level even two years ago. But here we are. And I think this December rally that you've seen in gold and in the precious metals is really a continuation of the same themes we've seen throughout this year. It's about. It's about the debasement. Trade is the growing sort of mistrust in traditional assets, the sovereign bonds and currencies. It's about the weaker dollar. It's a bit central banks buying gold because of those things, and it's about a little bit more private investor money coming into gold. But you have all that and then you have kind of low liquidity in the in the end of year season, which means that these kind of momentum trades can can take hold and spreads to other metals. We've obviously seen silver, platinum, palladium, all these precious metals that are very small markets and can make very big moves. We've seen those start to make pretty spectacular moves, in fact, in the last few days. Yeah. And you know, when they use a spectacular could sometimes be an understatement. It tells you how good things have been. Martin Leap Let's talk about copper. Obviously, the we all know about the supply issues there, the big the three big copper biggest copper mines in the world. Where is there? Well, when I look at the economic forecast for next year and this is the economic overlay, people seem to have a mixed view on whether the global economy will do better next year compared to this year. And I wonder whether there is an economic consideration when you look at Dr. Copper doing what it's doing to the upside. I would I would. I see this opportunity to talk a little bit about the downside for for for copper. You know, we're seeing this we're seeing this rally to 12,000 well past 12,000 already. And we're seeing this happening even as demand for copper is is quite weak, especially here in in China. We've seen over the past two months a really quite marked slump in demand and supply driven rallies, especially when they're driven by a kind of time limited thing like the prospect of us import tariffs are maybe not that reliable and is already a lot of people saying that 12,000 is just too high for copper. It's it's higher than where it should be relative to demand. If we look globally at supply, the market is not that tight. It's it's only because there's a lot of stuff going to the US two front run tariffs that you're getting this sort of slightly distorted sense of where prices are. So those are all reasons to be kind of a little bit more cautious. A guess about about next year with copper at these already very high levels. MARTIN Thank you. Mark Rich in in Shanghai for us, our metals and mining reporter there. Right. Just ahead here, we're having some when we talk about a closer look, really a close and deeper and comprehensive look at Seattle specifically. So the company has taken on new heights this year. It's setting its sights then on further expansion overseas. But there are some speed bumps and bottlenecks ahead, including politicians and Donald Trump in the way. Details on that story just ahead. This is Bloomberg. You're watching the China show and taking a look at some stocks that are moving very strongly to the upside today. These are smart driving stocks listed in on the mainland. But but the story here and the reporting we're actually getting from Xinhua is that the that Beijing city has issued the first batch of license plates for all three autonomous vehicle operating on expressways. Now, to put it in perspective, L three technology, it's when the technology of the vehicle becomes significantly more autonomous. So at this point, maybe you can have a car that can really perform all driving tasks at some point, maybe where humans can start to recline a little bit in their seats and focus on other tasks. That's what the technology is capable of. A step below what you see Robotaxis operating at today, which is L4 but definitely above L2. The way we see in terms of basic adaptive cruise control lane centering other sorts of technologies as well. Dave, you know, when you mentioned L2, and I think a lot of people will well appreciate this jump in my in my head it's l2l3l4. It just makes me think about my discs and my lower back. Right. So L4 L5 a lot of people have heard her animations and I'll just borrow of course, people people like me. We do need, of course, reclining seats when you do have bad backs, right, Because they alleviate some of the pressure on your L4, L5 sometimes even that's one OC anyway. That's okay. Let me. How did I get myself into this corner? Let me pull myself out of this hole and then pivot back, get back on the road. Talk about Seattle, the world's biggest EV maker, with a fantastic big take today on this. Get this, the company has powered one in three cars sold this year. That's according to data from South Korean based energy research. But as growth slows domestically, the company is now looking abroad for expansion. Let's bring in our transport reporter here, Linda Loo, to talk us to today's big take. Let's talk about, pun intended, the road ahead and the road overseas here for the company before we talk about the challenges. Yeah. So Seattle is making a really big push into Europe as already built two factories, one in Germany, one in Hungary where it's producing batteries to supply to us clients like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes on the continent is building a third factory in partnership with Stellantis and Spain. So it's really ramping up presence in Europe. What's in the way and the way is a uneven demand. You're seeing that in China. You're also seeing a little bit of that In Europe. We just saw the EU essentially kind of scale back the commitments to phasing out sales of petrol and diesel cars by in the near future. So that step back, combined with some of European countries like Germany and France scaling back incentives to support EV purchases, could in the long run kind of slow down this demand for EVs. But I think Seattle is banking that the transition towards EVs will might be uneven, but it's not going away. So is really putting its production capacity on the line there. What can it do in terms of containing costs as it looks to expand, then, if it really doesn't have any other choice but continue to look to your really. Yes, that's right. Europe has a really important market for car sales, as well as EVs outside of China. You're probably seeing the biggest source of demand from the European continent. And another big factor is the higher prices that even makers can command in Europe. So that's really going to help boost the margins of these manufacturers, especially considering at home there's a price war that's being waged for the Chinese companies. So Seattle is also hoping to capitalize on some of those higher margins in Europe. On the flip side, as factories that's operating in Germany, maybe possibly Hungary is actually at a lower efficiency and probably at a higher cost compared to factories at home in China. So it's kind of a balancing act that needs to address as it develops. And the European markets, not so much a focus, I guess, for this piece, but just generally, can you help us understand as well for next year for Seattle, the the importance of of energy storage systems as well to the business, given you've got maybe some weaker or more mature demand already for the EV battery side. Yes, Energy storage systems is actually a market that a lot of people are banking on for fast growth, especially now as the demand for API and data centers are surging. So having these storage systems, I think these data centers will really help manage the energy demands that these operations will have. So Seattle has already made a lot of groundwork and foundations for producing energy solar storage systems, not only in China but in the US is actually very interesting. They are pivoting together with Ford to go into this energy storage energy storage systems market with Ford hoping to leverage the licensing deal it has, or Seattle to start providing those type of products. That's actually an area that you have if you make makers like Tesla already very strong and in the space. So it'll be really interesting to see how Seattle can kind of gain a little bit of access into the US market through partnerships like this. Linda, great reporting. That was Bloomberg's Linda Liu there in Hong Kong talking about today's big take, which is China's battery giant needing new markets after dominating at home. And on that point and continuing Seattle we actually spoke to earlier this year and the company told us that it's making overseas expansions its top priority in light of what Linda was saying. But amid an intense for domestic competition, its chief manufacturing officer spoke with Stephen Engle, our chief North Asia correspondent at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin early this year. Irrational competition. I will call it everyone but industrywide. And the government knew this is a problem in this House. This will destroy the industry. So there is a lot of a sentiment to come up with a regulation and a policy to prohibit this kind of price war. And as a result, that also forced everybody to dig in. Can you further improve your internal efficiency and so maintain reasonable business margin to survive, to continue to innovate? So for that part doubt, I expect there will. How are you doing that? How are you? We are proving good efficiency. We are trying to do everything improve the production utilization. How is I employed? They asked me used to actually see it has been using embracing the air revolution maybe seven, eight years ago. At that time it really started from simple repetitive task and manual work. They tried to use air to capture, to do more efficient work, and now we not only use AI to screen the material because the different material, different chemistry and also different design, and also during the stage of manufacturing and also after the sales. So air has been utilized to improve and make sure the processes are stable is in the control. Over the next 5 to 10 years, what would your ideal. Next generation super battery factory look like? Well, I would say in the next five years, ideally, let's take on all the trade barriers. All the consideration ideally should be green, number one, because we want to save our planet. The factory we actually already do extensive improvement. We reduce our energy consumption, reduce any of the emission and circulate any of the waste of material we recirculate into our production. That is number one. Number two, it should be a smart so that any human labour intensive, dangerous task should be taken care by machines, by robots, by computers. So that's what we are saying also should be reconfigurable, because when you put that down, this is a capital intensive facility where you put the production line you don't want to see, oh, after year the product, the end product, our consumer, our customers, the vehicle don't sell well. So we would like to switch that to a different vehicle. But can you quickly flexibly adjust, adapt to the new product? So that's our effort. We tried to make it as a user friendly as possible. How do you avoid the pitfalls of overcapacity that is affected the solar industry right now? And a lot of people in the industry are fearing that maybe there's going to be a battery overcapacity in the coming years. How do you feel about. Well, we don't look at that. We believe it when the global community going to a green sustainable award and there's a surge, the demand is drastically increasing. The key is a high quality battery. Of course, you can't if you don't put that high standard, you can put a cheap battery. That capacity maybe is are plentiful. But the consumer and our basically a workhorse OEM in the car industry energy company, they demand a high quality save and a long life battery for that it's there's a shortage. Otherwise we would not go to many parts of the world to make those high quality batteries. Would you say going overseas now because of the high demand demand? Well, there's obviously I wouldn't say the market is saturated in China yet, but there's a price war, obviously, which is brutal. Would you say, though, that your number one priority is kind of figuring out the international expansion, that sort of the best, I guess, algorithm for making it work? Is that your number one priority? Yes. And that was in June there. The chief manufacturing officer at the company with exclusively with a colleague, Stephen Engle. That conversation was back a few months back. The safety has really been and staying largely on theme here, it really has been a major concern for the industry this year following a fatal crash of a show me car that then led to a nationwide uproar. Steve also had a look at the story. He took a test track, took to a test track in Shanghai where Seattle is looking to make charging faster and also safer. Seattle likes to think of itself as doing sort of the dirty work of building electric vehicles, not only where the rubber meets the road, but where the charge is put into the chassis. Seattle's so-called skateboards are a modular cell to chassis product that integrate the battery cells under the floorboards with the chassis engine, drive, train and other modules. Seattle's many car brand customers then build out their own flashy bodies on top, and this stripped down and top off skateboard skeleton is not just for show. It rips on the test track. Our test drive took place just as Seattle touted it can now offer 520 kilometres or 323 miles of range from an industry best just 5 minutes of charging time. Total game changer. Because with that technology and then the infrastructure that follows behind it, range anxiety should be a thing of the past. Seattle has more than one third of the world's EV battery manufacturing capacity. They can scale it. Analysts say this will be the year in China when EVs finally outsell internal combustion engine passenger cars for the first time. But tragedy also has recently accompanied that rapid growth. In late March, a shammy SUV, seven traveling at high speed on an expressway with self-driving reportedly switched on, plowed into a concrete wall and caught fire, killing three people. The Shell Me accident really put the focus on EV safety, not only with autonomous driving, but with battery safety. This is the Seattle first generation of the skateboard chassis. Underneath are the batteries. The next generation called the bedrock, is promising at least 120 kilometers an hour. Frontal impact will not cause a fire or explosions. Also known as thermal runaway. Greater oversight safety will become a priority for a lot of these homes. They're all talking about it here. I think the problem with the way the self-driving technology features have been solved is it's caused people to think that they could be less attentive to the way the car is actually performing. You still need to monitor the car for putting the onus on battery makers to to make sure such a high impact thermal event won't lead to a fire. For one, is championing advancements in less combustible sodium ion batteries, which Catl says are ready for commercialization, though. Well, this reporter is ready for perhaps just one more spin around the track. Stephen Engle Bloomberg News Check. And we're going to continue the discussion, rather, on Chinese sector in the next hour. We'll have a battery analyst, you and me, from Great Will Securities and also the automobile City founder and CEO Bill Russo, who you just saw in that tape. But Bill Russo joining us as well. You can catch that interview at The Times on your screen. This is Bloomberg. Right. Welcome back. Just before we wrap up the show today, just a glance at markets in Vietnam, some weakness today. We were up as much as 1%, if not more. In the opening minutes, have since clearly pared back and still one of the best performers. In fact, I'd say it's the best performing index over the past five days on political clarity is what we're pointing to at this point in time. Right up on the up still. We're looking at gold. Of course, that's really been a big story. Gold stocks specifically when you look at Indonesia. There we go on your screen some of the big mining related names as gold continues to hit new highs. Just before we wrap up, a quick glance at the Hang Seng index and also some benchmarks to its reminder that we are a day to Christmas and we have some early closures of these markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and also in New Zealand, which is already shots, a truncated sessions there. And since this is our final full broadcast of the year, let me just take the opportunity to wish you all well a happy holiday. Thank you for joining us. Not just today, but for this year so far. We will see you all in full in the new year for the economy. Spend a bit of money for your future self. Maybe don't spend everything, but of course, spend a lot of time, if you can, with your loved ones from us here at the China show. We wish you all well. We'll see you all in the New year.

The announcement came after the US Food and Drug Administration surprisingly rejected Sanofi’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug tolebrutinib. Bloomberg’s Ashleigh Furlong reports.", "content": "00:00\n\nIs this still a surprise for Sanofi? Very much so, because we're seeing this situation obviously where vaccines globally, we were seeing sort of a hit to vaccine sales. Sanofi itself has said at the last quarter that its vaccine sales were down. In the US we have a Health Secretary, Robert F Kennedy, who is almost systematically undermining some of the tenets of vaccines really. But what we have seen is that's mainly targeting childhood vaccinations and this deal is mainly focused on adult immunizations. So I'm assuming that that said, Sanofi is hoping that adult immunizations are protected from those changes that we're seeing in the U.S.. And obviously, you know, this deal will well might take sort of, you know, several years to sort of show show true value for the company. So, you know, we might see changes in the in the rules around vaccines, but in the coming years in the U.S.. Okay. So actually, that's the vaccine story around Sanofi today. Sanofi has also said that the US FDA rejected its drug for multiple sclerosis. What does that setback mean for the French drugmaker? So this is a significant blow. We already in a way expected difficulties with the submission and the FDA had already delayed the to the decision date and we were expecting this potentially come next year. It's surprising this has come so quickly. And and it's also a significant blow potentially to two patients who with a specific type of M.S., which have few options. But for Sanofi, which is really trying to replace its leading drug, DUPIXENT, and that's coming generics are coming in in the next couple of years for that drug. And this this this mass drug was supposed to sort of help it on its way to just sort of replace those revenues. So this rejection in the U.S. is going to be significant for it. And Sanofi seems to hope that, you know, there's a way still a way forward and that it's still discussing with us, with the FDA. But obviously, it is a significant blow. This was the potential for 1.7 billion USD in annual revenue, which would, you know, we the sales will only potentially come from the rest of the world now.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:02 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T09:38:24.937038"}

The UK oil giant will divest a 65% stake, retaining the remaining interest via a joint venture. Bloomberg’s Mitchell Ferman reports.", "content": "00:00\n\nHow big a deal is this, then, for BP and for Stonepeak? Good morning. Yeah, BP reset its strategic direction earlier this year and part of that reset was announcing a $20 billion divestment program. Castrol its lubricants business was the central divestment target for for that program. And the expectations were that this asset could could bring BP as much as 0 billion. And and so, you know, as we as we see today, they sold a majority stake in it for about 6 billion. And obviously, Mitchell, good morning. We know that BP is undergoing this transition period, is getting a new CEO in Meg O'Neill. Does this sale mean that BP can streamline its portfolio as much perhaps, as Elliott wants it to do? Yeah, Good morning. It's you know, it definitely achieves a target that BP set out earlier this year. However, a lot has changed since BP set out that target right there. There is a new chairman. You know, you're talking about Novo Nordisk. There was a bit of a through line with BP. The chairman that departed both BP and Novo this year was Helgoland. And and his replacement at BP is And he is, as you say, he is made quick work with with the CEO change and And so there are still a lot of questions now about about the direction of BP. Yes. And think let's think about those into 2026 then Mitchell. I mean, this is a business that had what mishandled. Is that the way we describe it, a pivot towards renewables. Now it's going to be under a new management team. I mean, is this a sort of back to basics oil business? Is that where we're going? That's what it appears, right? The new chairman said that he wants a simpler, leaner BP. And clearly, And so Meg O'Neill, who starts in April, well, will have to lay out a vision that, you know, could go a number of directions. But the thing that is clear is that it will be an oil and gas vision. And do you think there will be more h.r. Personnel changes under meg o'neill's leadership than if it's going to be a serious pivot, hopefully successful pivot for them this time under her leadership. Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of unanswered questions. Staff internally, as we reported on bloomberg late last week. Staff is is uncertain about about what's happening right now, what's going to happen. They have gone through years of transformations, of strategic pivots, and now they have another another pivot. Murray didn't even have a year or two to kind of carry out his his plan. And now they're going to have a new CEO come in. Most people internally at BP were shocked by this kind of sudden announcement. That shock is probably what investors were were looking for to some degree. But as a result, there are a lot of questions about what's next. And and Meg will have to answer those in due time.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:17:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T09:38:25.220653"}

SHERRY SAID PPR A LITTLE HIGHER, TRADING HIGHER AFTER THE OIL GIANT AGREED TO SELL A MAJORITY STAKE IN ITS LUBRICANTS DIVISION TO THE U.S. INVESTMENT FIRM SANPETE PARTNERS TO RAISE ABOUT $6 BILLION. JOINING US FOR MORE IS A BIG OIL REPORTER MITCHELL FURMAN WHO IS WITH US THIS CHRISTMAS EVE AND HERE TO BREAK DOWN THE STORY. WE HAVE GOT SOME NEWS TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS GOOD I'M PERHAPS WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE A SLOW NEWS DAY. HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS THIS? > > GOOD MORNING. IT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF BP'S 20 BILLION KNOWLEDGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY, STRATEGIC RESET TO MOVE AWAY FROM ITS FAILED LOW CARBON BETS AND BACK TO OIL AND GAS. PART OF THAT WAS DIVESTING $20 MILLION OF ASSETS TO APPROVE THE BALANCE SHEET AND REVERSE YEARS OF UNDERPERFORMANCE IN WHICH THE GAP BETWEEN BP AND ITS COMPETITORS HAS WIDENED. ANNA: DOES THAT MEAN THIS CASTROL SALE, BP CAN STREAMLINE ITS PORTFOLIO? THIS HAS BEEN THE AREA OF FOCUS FROM A PARTICULAR ACTIVIST INVESTOR WHO IS HAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF IMPACT AT BP. > > THIS DOES MAKE SOME HEADWAY IN IN BP'S PORTFOLIO. CASTROL, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN IN BP'S PORTFOLIO THIS CENTURY SINCE IT ACQUIRED IT 25 YEARS AGO, THE ASSET WAS NOT AS FULLY INTEGRATED AS OTHER PARTS OF THE BUSINESS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS BP, WHILE IT IS A MASSIVE OIL AND GAS PRODUCER, IT IS ALSO A MAJOR COMMODITIES TRADER. AND CASTROL WAS NEVER REALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE TRADING BUSINESS LIKE BP'S REFINERIES AND UPSTREAM ASSETS AND PIPELINES WHICH IS TRADERS CAN USE TO OPTIMIZE. CASTROL NEVER REALLY PLAYED IN THAT WAY. SO IT ALLOWS BP TO KIND OF FOCUS ON PARTS OF THE BUSINESS WHERE IT CAN'T OPTIMIZE ITS TRADING ADVANTAGES. ANNA: THAT IS WHY THIS MIGHT BE THE RIGHT ASSET SALE, MITCHELL. WHAT ABOUT OTHER ASSET SALES? THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROGRAM OF SELLING ASSETS TO GET BACK TO BASICS I SUPPOSE FOR THIS OIL BUSINESS. WHAT ARE WE EXPECTED IN 2026 ON THAT FRONT? > > YOUR QUESTIONS ARE AS GOOD AS ANYBODY'S BECAUSE THE NEW CHAIRMAN JUST LAST WEEK ANNOUNCED ABRUPTLY THAT THE CEO WHO ANNOUNCED THE STRATEGIC RESET IN FEBRUARY WILL BE DEPARTING AND MEG O'NEILL WOULD BE COMING IN AS CEO TO REPLACE HIM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MEG O'NEILL WANTS TO DO. WE KNOW CHAIRMAN WANTS BP TO PREPARE BETTER, WHAT'S A SIMPLER, LEANER BP THAT ACCELERATES THIS OIL AND GAS STRATEGY. BUT HOW EXACTLY BP GETS THERE REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND MEG O'NEILL WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS. SHE TAKES OVER APRIL 1. ANNA: MITCHELL, THANK YOU FOR THE BRIEFING. A LOT TO COVER BP IN 2026 NO DOUBT. JOEL FUHRMAN ON THE OIL NARRATIVE THIS MORNING. LET'S TURN TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR. SHARE SUBS TO KNOW IF HE ON THE MOOD THIS MORNING. FROM HER GRAVE TO BUY -- THE FIRM AGREED TO BUY FOR $2.2 BILLION IN A BID TO EXPEND ITS VACCINE PORTFOLIO. THE STOCK IS DOWN .3%. WE ARE JOINED BY ASHLEIGH FURLONG. IS IT SURPRISING THIS BUSINESS THAT SO NO DOING THIS DEAL FOR A VACCINE DEVELOPER RIGHT NOW? TALK US THROUGH THE LOGIC. > > IT IS INTERESTING. AT THE MOMENT WE SEE VACCINE SALES GLOBALLY DOWN. IN THE U.S., VERY SPECIFIC SCENARIO PLAY OUT. WE HAVE A HEALTH SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. THAT IS ALMOST SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINING MANY OF THE TENETS OF VACCINES BRINGING IN QUESTIONS AROUND VACCINE SAFETY. MANY ARE TARGETED AT CHILD HOOD IMMUNIZATIONS. SO POTENTIALLY THERE IS LESS OF A TENSION IN THE ADULT VACCINES BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING TYPE TO BE DOING A VACCINE STEEL GLOBALLY AND SANOFI ITSELF HAS SAID VACCINE SALES ARE NOT DOING AS WELL IS HOPED. ANNA: THAT IS INTERESTING ON THE VACCINE SIDE OF THINGS AND WHY MAKE THIS AT THIS POINT. ELSEWHERE IN THE SANTA FE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY SAID THE U.S. FDA HAS REJECTED ITS DRUG FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. WHAT DOES THAT KIND OF SETBACK MEAN FOR THIS FRENCH PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS? > > IT IS A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK. THE SHARES HAVE NOT REALLY REACTED THAT MUCH AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST BEEN PRICED IN ALREADY. WE SAW EARLIER THIS MONTH THE FDA DELAYED, SAID IT WAS GOING TO DELAY ITS DECISION ON THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DRUG AND ANALYST HAD ANTICIPATED THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A NEGATIVE REACTION. BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR A REALLY TRYING TO REPLACE ITS TOP-SELLING DRUG TO PICK SENT. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF REPLACING AND AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THAT $1.7 BILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE THAT WE HOPED FOR FOR THE DRUG IS UNDER QUESTION AND THEIR QUESTIONS AROUND WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO GET ANY OF THAT REVENUE IN THE COMING YEARS. ANNA: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. HAVE A GOOD BREAK. THE LATEST ON SANOFI. LET'S WIDEN THE LENS. STOCKS AND COMMODITIES HITTING RECORDS DUE TO POLITICAL TENSION AND DATA FROM THE UNITED STATES SHOWING THE ECONOMY EXPANDED AT ITS FASTEST PACE IN TWO YEARS. ALL OF THAT IS VERY MUCH IN THE BACKGROUND FOR ALL ASSET CLASSES RIGHT NOW. LET'S TURN TO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CREDIT MARKETS. JOSH FARBER IS WITH US FROM BNP PARIBAS. NICE TO SPEAK TO YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SPEAK TO US ON 24 DECEMBER NO LESS. WE HAVE A HOST OF THINGS AND PLAY RIGHT NOW. STOCKS ARE DOING REALLY WELL. METALS, COMMODITIES ARE DOING WELL. WHAT KIND OF OPTIMISM TO CREDIT MARKETS GO INTO 2026 WITH? WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK LOOK LIKE TO YOU? > > WE ARE BULLISH ON CREDIT AND WE THINK MOST ASSETS PRICE THAT BULLISHNESS, NOT ALL OF THEM DO, AND WE WANT TO LOOK TO BUY THE ASSETS THAT HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE RALLY. THE PLACE WE START IS HIGH-YIELD SINGLE BE. ANNA: WHY THE HIGH-YIELD? WHY NOT INVESTMENT GRADE? WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE HIGH-YIELD SPACE YOU THINK IS WORTH THE RISK AND PAYING YOU THE REWARD YOU NEED? > > GREAT QUESTION. THE FIRST POINT IS THAT THE RISK TO THE DOWNSIDE FROM LOWER GROWTH WE THINK HAS GONE AWAY. WE THINK THE PATH IS TOWARD A WARMER EUROPEAN ECONOMY LED BY GERMAN FISCAL AND HIGH-YIELD, PARTICULARLY EXPOSED TO INCREASING GROWTH. THE OTHER POINT IS HIGH-YIELD IS CHEAP. ESPECIALLY SINGLE B BECAUSE IT WAS UNFAIRLY TAINTED BY THE PRIVATE CREDIT DEFAULTS IN THE U.S. ANNA: INTERESTING. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN THE GERMAN FISCAL PUSH AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE CREDIT SPACE. IN GERMANY, THEY ARE LOADING UP OUR DEFENSE SPENDING AND ALSO DOING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. IS IT IN BOTH AREAS YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS TO PLAY OUT WELL FOR CREDIT OR MORE THE MOOD MUSIC AROUND THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING MORE AND THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT INTO THE GERMAN ECONOMY? > > IT IS THE -- FIRST OF ALL, IT IS THE POINT OF THE AGGREGATE GROWTH PICTURE IS STRONGER. IN HIGH-YIELD, WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT IS DO YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK? IT IS HARD TO HAVE DEFAULTS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING FASTER. THE SECOND POINT IS HAVING A GLUT OF BULLETINS, WHICH WERE NOT REALLY USED TO AND EUROPE, MEANS THE ASSETS WHICH COMPETE FOR BUNDS, RELATIVELY FEW ARE AROUND. AND THE SCARCITY POINT WE THINK PEOPLE WILL FLEE RATES AND GOING TO CREDIT. ANNA: WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET? WE SPENT A LOT OF THIS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STRESS IN FRANCE IN PARTICULAR AND SOME CORPORATE'S IN FRANCE CAN BORROW MORE CHEAPLY THAN THE SOVEREIGN FOR EXAMPLE NOW. WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS IN RELATION TO YOUR PREFERENCE FOR HIGH-YIELD IN EUROPE? > > WE THINK THE POINT IS THAT THERE IS ENOUGH GOVERNMENT BOND SUPPLY TO KEEP RATES STEEP AND RELATIVELY HIGH IN EUROS AND THAT IS KIND OF A SWEET SPOT FOR CREDIT WHERE IT IS ENOUGH YIELDS TO ATTRACT INVESTORS IN BUT NOT SO VOLATILE TO SCARE INVESTORS AWAY. ANNA: THE SOVEREIGN SIDE? IS THAT LEFT OTHERS TO DECIDE? > > LISTEN, I'M THE CREDIT GUIDE. I WOULD SAY THE MAIN POINT IS WE ARE QUITE COMFORTABLE ON HOW THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM IS POSITIONED WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT. AND SO THIS CONVERGENCE TREND WE SEE, IF WE HAVE MORE BUND, WE ARE LESS OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT IS QUITE HEALTHY FROM A CREDIT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOVEREIGN RISK IN THE WAY YOU DID 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO. ANNA: CREDIT MARKETS HAVE BEEN ENJOYING A LOT OF ISSUANCE FROM HYPERSCALERS RECENTLY. IS THAT SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING PLAY OUT EVEN MORE IN 2026? > > THAT IS THE KEY THING TO WATCH. IN CASH WHAT WE WANT TO BUY SINGLE B IS HER MAIN ASSET OF CHOICE, THE THING WE WANT TO SELL IS THE LONG END OF AN EUROS AND DOLLARS. WE ARE NOT USED TO THE LEVEL OF DURATION, LEVEL OF SUPPLY WE ARE GOING TO SEE FROM THESE HIGH QUALITY HYPERSCALERS. SO THAT IS BASICALLY THE COMPRESSION TRADE IS ON THE ONE HAND, HIGH RISK ASSETS ARE UNDERSUPPLIED AND LOW RISK ASSETS ARE VERY HEAVILY SUPPLIED . WE THINK SOMETHING LIKE 10% OF THE TOTAL HYPERSCALE DEBT ISSUANCE IS GOING TO COME TO EUROS. BUT 10% OF THE AMERICAN MARKET WHEN THE DOLLAR MARKET IS THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF THE EURO MARKET AND ABOUT 2.5 TIMES DURATION, IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. ANNA: WHETHER IN DOLLARS OR EUROS, NOT PAYING YOU ENOUGH CASH NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH? > > IT IS NOT THE ISSUER'S THEMSELVES, IT IS MORE THE DURATION BUCKET OF THE EXISTING BONDS WILL NEED TO REPRICE FROM EVERY COMPANY THAT ISSUES AT THE LONG AND IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH THE SUPPLY COMING. ANNA: THAT IS WHAT IT DOES TO THE REST OF THE MARKET. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT WHETHER STOCKS ARE OVERVALUED IN THE HYPERSCALER SPACE FOR EXAMPLE. ONE THING THEY CHOSE TO WATCH AS DEBT LEVELS. THEY SAY IT IS DIFFERENT TO THE LATE 1990'S BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT VERY INDEBTED COMPANIES. YOUR CAUTION RALLIES HYPERSCALERS IS NOT TO DO WITH IN WORRIED ABOUT DEBT SUSTAINABILITY, IT IS MORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH REWARD FOR TAKING ON THE DEBT. > > IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL POSITION WE THINK THAT PART OF THE REASON WHY THE DEBT IS COMING IS BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO IT, BUT THE POINT FROM THE INVESTOR PERSPECTIVE IS THE TECHNICAL AROUND THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THERE IS SO MUCH SUPPLIED THAT IT WILL BE PRICED IN THE MARKET. ANNA: THERE AREAS YOU DO WORRY ABOUT, TO FASTER GROWTH RATE OF DEBT FOR SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES ON THE AI BUILD OUT, THE DATA CENTER BUILDOUT? ARE THERE ANY ALARM BELLS GOING OFF RIGHT NOW? > > WE DON'T HAVE ALARM BELLS. OBVIOUSLY, NEED TO LOOK AT THE CREDITS CASE-BY-CASE. BUT ON THE WHOLE, WE THINK CREDIT IS STILL IN A FAIRLY SWEET SPOT WHERE THERE IS ENOUGH SUPPLY IN DOLLARS FOR THE BOND SCARCITY BUT NOT SO MUCH AS TO DROWN US. ANNA: WE TALKED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM ABOUT M & A STORIES, BP SELLING ONE ASSET, SANOFI BUYING ANOTHER ASSET. IF M & A COMES BACK IS A BIG THEME IN 2026 -- IT IS ARGUABLY HERE ALREADY AND INVESTMENT BANKERS HAVE BEEN TELLING US IT WAS COMING FOR A WHILE. PRIVATE EQUITY MAY BE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING AS WELL. IF WE SEE MUCH MORE M & A, IS THAT GOING TO MEAN A LOT MORE CREDIT ISSUANCE? IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL PLAY INTO YOUR SPACE? > > THAT PLACE AND OUR FORECAST BUT LARGELY A DOLLAR STORY. THE ANIMAL SPIRITS ARE MUCH STRONGER IN THE U.S. IN EUROPE, WE SAY IT IS MORE LIKE A PLANT. THE PACE OF M & A WE EXPECT IN EUROPE IS MATERIALLY SLOWER. AND THAT REFLECTS JUST A DIFFERENT ECONOMY AND DIFFERENT SECTOR MIX. ANNA: THE M & A STORY WILL BE STATESIDE YOU THINK? A LOT OF PRIVATE EQUITY NAMES AND EUROPE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME FOR M & A TICKET IN SO THEY CAN TRY AND GET SOME OF THEIR MONEY BACK. > > WE THINK IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL YOU A STORY, YES. ANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, JOSH FARBER, HEAD OF EUROPEAN CREDIT STRATEGY AT BNP PARIBAS. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS REIGNITED TENSIONS OVER GREENLAND THIS WEEK AS HE APPOINTED HIS FIRST EVER OR THE FIRST EVER U.S. ENVOY TO GREENLAND. WE WILL DISCUSS WITH ROBERTA HAAR OF MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: WELCOME BACK. THIS IS \"THE PULSE.\" LIVE FROM LONDON. PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SAYS UKRAINE AND THE UNITED STATES REMAIN SPLIT PRIMARILY ON TERRITORIAL ISSUES IN TALKS ON A PEACE PLAN TO END RUSSIA'S WAR. WEEKS OF U.S. BROKERED TALKS HAVE PRODUCED 20 POINT PEACE PLAN THAT COULD BECOME THE BASIS FOR ENDING EUROPE'S WORST CONFLICT SINCE WORLD WAR II. THE UKRAINIAN LEADER EMPHASIZED THE DRAFT LARGELY REFLECTS THE JOINT UKRAINIAN AMERICAN POSITION AND SOME POINTS STILL NEED TO BE FINALIZED. MEANWHILE, RUSSIAN CONTINUES TO TARGET UKRAINE'S POWER SUPPLY WITH MISSILES AND DRONES AT A TIME OF YEAR WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND FREEZING. THE CEO OF UKRAINE'S BIGGEST PRIVATE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT, TOLD BLOOMBERG THIS IS GOING TO BE THE HARDEST WINTER YET. > > UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE UNDER MASSIVE ATTACKS OF RUSSIANS AND THE MAJOR TARGET ATTACK IS POWER STATIONS. AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE BEING ATTACKED ON A PER STATION MORE THAN SIX TIMES SINCE SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR. I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE HARDEST WINTER SINCE A FULL-SCALE INVASION. ANNA: MEANWHILE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS IMPOSED VISA SANCTIONS ON FORMER EU COMMISSIONER AND FOUR OTHER PEOPLE FOR TRYING TO MAKE AMERICAN TECH COMPANIES POLICE POLITICAL SPEECH. IN A POST ON X, RESPONDED THE EUROPEAN WAR WAS VOTED IN WITH BROAD-BASED SUPPORT WRITING \"TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS, CENSORSHIP IS IT WHERE YOU THINK IT IS.\" THE STATE DEPARTMENT TARGETED ACTIVISTS AND NONPROFITS FOCUSED ON DIGITAL HATE SPEECH. LET'S DISCUSS THE BROAD DEFENSE AND DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS WITH ROBERTA HAAR, PROFESSOR OF FOREIGN POLICY AT MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY. PROFESSOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET'S START WITH THE BROAD STATE OF AFFAIRS TRANSATLANTIC LATE. WE RECENTLY HEARD FROM THE UNITED STATES CODIFYING THEIR SECURITY STRATEGY UNDER THIS NEW NATIONAL SECURITY DOCUMENT. I WONDER WHERE THAT LEAVES THE STATE OF RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC? > > THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. YES, AT THE MOMENT, RELATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY BUMPY. CERTAINLY, THE DOCUMENT THAT JUST CAME OUT REALLY WOULD PUSH, SHE MENTIONED BEFORE, THE FAR RIGHT OR THOSE THAT ARE ALIGNING MOST OF THE MAGA IDEAS WITHIN EUROPE, AND THIS WOULD SEEM TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT ALSO WITH JD VANCE THAT THE DIGITAL GOVERNANCE IS A PROBLEM, AS YOU SAID, RATON IS THINKING ABOUT THE EU FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS. SORRY, I'M GETTING RATHER NERVOUS. ANNA: THAT'S OK. LET ME ASK A QUESTION ON THAT MIGHT HELP US TO FOCUS THE CONVERSATION A LITTLE MORE. HOW DO YOU THINK EUROPE SHOULD RESPOND? THE UNITED STATES HAS PLACED SANCTIONS ON PEOPLE LIKE TERRY RATON, WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT SUGGESTS THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETING FREE SPEECH. HOW SHOULD EUROPE TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT SANCTIONING OF THOSE KINDS OF INDIVIDUALS? > > I THINK ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING THIS FLATTERING PLOY AND RESPONDING -- I THINK EUROPEANS SHOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO COME THEY SHOULD FIRMLY RESIST THIS PRESSURE TO SAFEGUARD, SHOULD TRY TO SAFEGUARD THE REGULATORY AUTONOMY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGIES WE HAD I WAS WITH A POLICY BRIEF AND WE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE CLEAR INTERNAL POSITIONS, SHOULD RESIST THE TIPS TO DILUTE OR REINTERPRET THEIR DIGITAL MARKETS, DIGITAL SERVICE ACT, AI ACT AND SHOULD TRY TO HOLD IT AS A REGULATORY LEADER. I THINK THEY SHOULD RESIST TRYING TO TRADE AWAY THEIR DIGITAL STANDARDS AND NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING TRADE, TARIFFS, SECURITY COOPERATION. I THINK THEY SHOULD TRY TO SHIELD THEIR EU DECISION-MAKING FROM THEIR COERCIVE BARGAINING TACTICS COMING OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. ANNA: ROBERTA, WHY DO YOU THINK EUROPE APPEARS SO CONSTRAINED WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? CLEARLY, WITH UNITED STATES PROVIDING THE SECURITY BACKDROP OVER DECADES, THAT HAS BECOME TOO COMFORTABLE POSITION PERHAPS FOR EUROPE, CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE THE VIEW OF THE AMERICANS. SO MAYBE THAT LIMITS EUROPE'S ABILITY TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. > > EUROPE DEFINITELY HAS HISTORY OF FRAGMENTATION. HISTORY OF THINKING OF SOVEREIGNTY MINDSETS. THEY ALSO HAVE MANY VULNERABILITIES. BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO INTENSIFY THEIR MILITARY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES SO THEY ARE DOING THAT. I'M SURE YOU HAVE DISCUSSED ALREADY THE LONDON-BASED II SS STUDIES HAS TALKED ABOUT THE THREAT FOR THE RUSSIA COMING AS EARLY AS 2027. IT COULD TAKE AS MUCH AS $1 TRILLION TO BRING UP THEIR NON-NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES ON A LEVEL THAT THE U.S. IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING. THEY ARE DOING THAT BUT I THINK THIS FRAGMENTATION IN PROCUREMENT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE JOINT PROCUREMENT, LESS WEAPONS SYSTEMS COMPARED TO THE PAST. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THEY NEED TO DO TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR DEFENSE PROCUREMENT AND POSTURE. ANNA: WITH ALL THAT SAID, ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A FLAREUP IN TENSIONS BE AROUND GREENLAND AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY. THE STORY SORT OF LINGERS. HOW SHOULD EUROPE RESPOND ON THIS KIND OF FRONT? PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING -- WELL, POINTING SOMEBODY TO BE ALMOST LIKE AN AMBASSADOR TO GREENLAND AND MAKING CLEAR THERE IS STILL AN INTENTION TO TRY AND MAKE THAT AMERICAN? > > CERTAINLY TRUMP HAS PAID TO PLAY FOREIGN POLICY I TALKED ABOUT WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SORT OF BASED ON MORE OF AN OVERSEAS PRESSURE. LOTS OF CORRUPTION SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. I GUESS GREENLAND WOULD FALL INTO THAT. THERE WAS A RECENT ARTICLE THAT IS PART OF A GOAL TO HAVE EUROPE AS A NEOCOLONIAL OUTLOOK ON HOW TO DEAL WITH EUROPE, THE WINNERS IN THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. SO LIKES THIS TOUGH GUY AND EUROPE WOULD BE SORT OF THE DEBTS REPLACED BY THE ALPHA MALES OF THE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT. ANNA: AND PART OF THAT ANALYSIS, DOES THAT INCLUDE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA -- WHICH HAS BEEN TRULY RESHAPED I SUPPOSE UNDER THIS TRUMP PRESIDENCY? > > I THINK TRUMP HAS A FONDNESS FOR RUSSIA OR IDEA THAT HE WANTS TO DEAL IN A TRANSACTIONAL WAY OR INVESTMENT WAY WITH RUSSIA SINCE HIS FIRST ADMINISTRATION. IN AN ARTICLE IN 2021, CERTAINLY THAT IS CONSISTENT OF HIS VIEW OR EVEN BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT THAT HE HAD THIS VERY POSITIVE VIEW TOWARD PUTIN AND TOWARD RUSSIA AND NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE INVESTMENT POSSIBILITIES WITH RUSSIA. CERTAINLY, HE LIKES TOUGH GUYS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW TRUMP DID WITH POLITICO, HE ALSO CALLED EUROPEAN LEADERS WEAK BUT HE WAS VERY POSITIVE ABOUT ERODGAN OF TURKEY. HE CALLED HIM A TOUGH COOKIE. IN ONE WAY EUROPE CAN RESPOND TO TRUMP IS NOT LETTING HIM BULLY THEM BUT TO DO WHAT MARK CARNEY DID OR ERDOGAN OR EVEN WHAT SUSIE WILES TALKS ABOUT IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, STAND UP TO HIM OR THE NOT SO FLATTERING BUT MORE RESILIENT AND MORE TOUGH. ANNA: ROBERTA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY, ROBERTA HAAR. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, A BUSY YEAR IN THE COURTS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HIS ADMINISTRATION LOSES A CASE AT THE SUPREME COURT THAT IS ANOTHER RULING UPHELD BY FEDERAL JUDGE. ALL OF THAT JUST YESTERDAY. WE BREAK DOWN ALL OF THIS WITH A LAW PROFESSOR SHORTLY. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME BACK TO \"THE PULSE.\" THESE ARE YOUR TOP STORIES. THE CENTER REALLY MARCHES ON. THE S & P HITS A RECORD AND GOLD BREAKS THROUGH $4500 FOR THE FIRST TIME. MARKETS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POND CLOSE EARLY TODAY. BLOWOUT GDP IN THE USA, AMERICAN GROWTH CRUSHES ESTIMATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER WITH ITS FASTEST READING IN TWO YEARS. AND A SETBACK FOR BIG TECH AND SKILLED FOREIGN WORKERS. A FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN MOVE AHEAD WITH A $100,000 FEE ON APPLICATIONS FOR NEW H-1B VISAS. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN IT COMES TO SETTING POLICY AND EXPANDING THE LIMITS OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER. IT CERTAINLY TESTING THEM WITH HIS TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENTS IN PARTICULAR, SENDING SHOCKWAVES AROUND THE WORLD. BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS CHIEF ECONOMIST LOOKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE TRADE POLICY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR INFLATION AND THE U.S. CONSUMER. > > CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE, PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A BIG BET THE U.S. HAD A MAGNETIC APPEAL. AND THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO GET A BETTER DEAL FROM U.S. TRADE PARTNERS AND COMPANIES THAT WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. ON THE EVIDENCE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS, THAT IS PLAYING OUT PRETTY NICELY. ECONOMISTS DON'T AGREE ON MUCH. ONE THING THEY DO AGREE ON IS THAT FREE TRADE IS GOOD AND THAT TARIFFS ARE BAD. TRUMP ESCALATED U.S. TARIFFS ON CHINA ALL THE WAY TO 125%. IF YOU PLUGGED THE U.S. TARIFFS INTO A MODEL OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WHAT IT SAID WAS THERE WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT DRAG ON GROWTH AND THERE WAS ALSO GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT UPWARD IMPULSE TO PRICES. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO INFLATION OVER THE SUMMER, IT HAS NOT COME DOWN BUT IT HAS NOT COME UP EITHER. WHY IS THAT? IT IS BECAUSE U.S. IMPORTERS AND FOREIGN EXPORTERS SAW THE TRUMP TARIFFS COMING AND THEY RUSHED TO FRONT LOAD, SHIPPING TO THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE TARIFFS COULD COME INTO FORCE. ONE THING THAT IS HAPPEN IS WE HAVE GONE FROM A LOT OF UNEXPECTED BAD NEWS CONCENTRATED ON A SINGLE DAY TO A SERIES OF COUNTRY BY COUNTRY DEALS, SOMETHING OF A SWISS CHEESE OF EXEMPTIONS AND CARVEOUTS. THE TRADE WAR IS A DRAG BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING WHICH IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE GOT TAX CUTS WITH TRUMP 'S ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL AND A BONFIRE OF REGULATIONS WHICH IS STOKING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS OF U.S. BUSINESSES. WE ALSO HAVE GOT THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT GOING INTO DATA CENTERS. TARIFFS ARE HAVING AN EFFECT. CHINA'S EXPORTS TO THE U.S. ARE WAY DOWN RELATIVE TO THE HISTORICAL TREND. SO WHO PAYS FOR THE COST OF TARIFFS? DESPITE HIS WELL-KNOWN LOVE OF GOLD, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT AN ALCHEMIST. HE CAN'T MAKE SOMETHING FROM NOTHING. THAT MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE READ ALL OF THE EVIDENCE SO FAR SUGGESTS THAT IN THE END, THE BULK OF IT IS GOING TO COME FROM U.S. BUSINESSES AND U.S. HOUSEHOLDS. ANNA: REPORTING ON WHITE HOUSE TRADE POLICY AND THE IMPACT IT HAS AND HAS NOT HAD ON THE U.S. ECONOMY. LET'S PIVOT FROM THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS TO THE LEGAL SIDE. A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED THAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN GO AHEAD WITH IMPOSING A $100,000 FEE ON NEW H-1B VISAS APPLICATIONS. IT IS A SETBACK FOR U.S. TECH COMPANIES PERHAPS THAT RELY ON HIRING SKILL FOREIGN WORKERS. THE JUDGE SAID THE MOVE WAS LAWFUL BUT THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WHICH SUED TO BLOCK THE PROPOSAL, CAN APPEAL. MEANWHILE, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS REFUSED TO LET PRESIDENT TRUMP DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN CHICAGO. A MAJORITY OF JUDGES RULED THE ADMINISTRATION FAILED TO IDENTIFY A SOURCE OF AUTHORITY THAT WOULD ALLOW THE MILITARY TO EXECUTE THE LAWS. AT THE MOVE IS A SETBACK FOR TRUMP'S BRIBED TO USE OF MILITARY IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LET'S PUT THIS TOGETHER AS THE YEAR COMES TO A CLOSE AND ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE JOINED NOW TO DISCUSS THE SUPREME COURT IN PARTICULAR BY ILARIA DI GIOIA WHO IS WITH US TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL SIDE, LAW PROFESSOR AT BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. WE HAVE GONE TO A COUPLE OF STORIES HOW IN SOME CASES PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WINNING OUT AND THE EXECUTIVE IS GETTING ITS WAY IN WHAT IT WANTS AND IN OTHER WAYS THE LAW, THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS PUSHING BACK AGAINST HIM. HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE 2025 AND THE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE SEEN BETWEEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE EXECUTIVE? > > 2025 HAS BEEN A VERY DISTINCT YEAR FOR A LAW PROFESSOR TO WATCH AND I THINK FOR EVERYONE. IF WE PUT IT IN A FRAME COME THE SUPREME COURT IS A CONSERVATIVE COURT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS APPOINTED THREE OF ITS MEMBERS. ACTUALLY, WHAT WE EXPECTED WAS THE SUPREME COURT TO BE INCREASINGLY FAVORING PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS HAS BEEN EVIDENT IN MANY CASES. YOU JUST MENTIONED THE TARIFFS. THE CASE WAS DISCUSSED IN NOVEMBER, THE HEARING WAS IN NOVEMBER AT THE SUPREME COURT. WE DON'T KNOW YET THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE BUT WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUSHING THE JUDGES TO RULE IN HIS FAVOR AND IS DOING THIS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, DOING PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE ON JUDGES THAT ARE HIS NOMINEES. THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AMERICAN SYSTEM, OF THE AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE JUDGES ARE NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT. SO IT IS SOMEHOW POLITICIZED IS A COURT THAT IS VERY EXPLICITLY POLITICIZED. AND IT IS A COURT THAT IS IDEOLOGICAL. SO CONSERVATIVE JUDGES HAVE CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGY. ANNA: THIS YEAR, HAVE WE SEEN THE SUPREME COURT ACT IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP MORE THAN WE MIGHT HAVE DONE UNDER PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT'S WHEN THEY WERE NOT -- THEY DO NOT REPRESENT QUITE SO MANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPOINTMENTS? > > WELL, IF WE PUT EVERYTHING ON THE SCALE, WE CAN SEE THE TREND ALREADY STARTED DURING THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. MANY WERE TAKEN BY THE SAME JUSTICES. THE TREND IS ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO THE FIRST TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND THE SORT OF SLOWLY INCREASING -- I WOULD NOT SAY THIS IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW OR UNEXPECTED. THIS IS JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FIRST TRUMP PRESIDENCY, OF THE NOMINATION OF THE JUSTICES. AS I SAID, WE ALREADY SEE THE TREND UNDER BIDEN AND THIS EXPANSION OF EXECUTIVE POWER THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT IS VERY, VERY EVIDENT STARTED ALREADY UNDER THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. ANNA: GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MUCH -- OK, SO UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW MUCH OF A STEP UP WE ARE SEEING IN THIS USE OF UNILATERAL EXECUTIVE ACTION. > > WELL, THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE IS A THEORY CALLED THE EXECUTIVE THEORY THAT SAYS THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE ALL THE POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND IT MEANS THE POWER THAT CONGRESS DELEGATES TO THE PRESIDENT'S POWER THE PRESIDENT CAN HOLD UNILATERALLY. NOW, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY -- NOT ONLY IN THE COURT BUT IN FACT, THE CONGRESS OF SLOWLY DELEGATING AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO TARIFFS. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ARGUING THE CONGRESS HAS GIVEN HIM THE POWER TO IMPOSE TARIFFS AND THIS IS, AS I SAID, A SLOW PROCESS THAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE FOR ONE MAIN REASON -- NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COURT, IT IS BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS GIVEN UP ITS CONFIDENCE TO THE PRESIDENT. THE POLARIZATION THAT HAVING AN CONGRESS FROM THE GRIDLOCK, THIS INCREASING DIFFICULTY IN COMING TO A DECISION MEANS THE PRESIDENT HAS THE UPPER HAND. DELEGATION OF POWER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY CONGRESS AND IS NOW UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE SUPREME COURT. ANNA: IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THEN THE SUPREME COURT WILL AGREE WITH THAT VIEW, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VIEW AND SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO ON THESE IEEPA TARIFFS? IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT WILL HAPPEN OR WE SAW QUITE A LOT OF REPORTING THAT SUGGESTED THE EARLY COMMENTARY COMING FROM THE SUPREME COURT WOULD PUSH AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. > > INDEED. DURING THE HEARING, THE JUDGES -- THE JUSTICES WERE PUSHING AND WERE PUSHING AGAINST THE FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR TRUMP. HIS NOMINEES WERE PUSHING AGAINST HIM. BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DECISIONS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE ON PAPER. IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THE DECISION TO ARISE. AND THERE HAVE BEEN OF COURSE AMICUS BRIEFS PUSHING AGAINST -- THE FACT REMAINS THE COURT IS A CONSERVATIVE COURT. IF WE DON'T SEE A DECISION IN FAVOR OF TRUMP, WE WILL SEE A DECISION MAY BE OF THOSE NEUTRAL DECISIONS THE SUPREME COURT ABSTAINING FROM DECIDING RATED THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER OPTION. SO I DON'T SEE THE SUPREME COURT TO BE COMPLETELY IN FAVOR OF TRUMP BEING ABLE TO IMPOSE TARIFFS BECAUSE IT IS A VERY NARROW LEGAL ISSUE THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON. IT IS QUITE PROBLEMATIC. BUT SEE THE SUPREME COURT USING HIS VERY INTERESTING LEGAL WEAPONS TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL. ANNA: SO I HADN'T REALIZED THEY COULD ABSTAIN. AT IS INTERESTING. WHEN WE EXPECT -- SOME EXPECTED WE MIGHT GET A DECISION THIS WEEK. LOOKING LESS LIKELY I SUPPOSE. > > THE CASE IS NOT A NORMAL CASE. IT IS ONE OF THOSE EXPEDITED DECISIONS. USUALLY CASES ARE DECIDED IN JUNE BUT I WOULD EXPECT THE CASE TO BE DECIDED A BIT EARLIER PERHAPS JANUARY OR FEBRUARY BECAUSE IT WILL NEED AN EXPEDITED DECISION. ANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, ILARIA DI GIOIA, LAW PROFESSOR AT BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY WITH THAT BRIEFING ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE EXECUTIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE ARE WATCHING OIL PRICES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THIS MORNING. NEARLY HALF A DOZEN TANKERS LADEN WITH CRUDE HAVE DEPARTED FROM VENEZUELA'S COAST DESPITE INCREASED PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES. DATA SHOWS MOST OF THE TANKERS ARE HEADED TO WASHINGTON AND AT LEAST HALF OF THEM ARE CHARTERED BY CHEVRON AS A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INTENSIFIES EFFORTS TO CURB OIL REVENUE BY TARGETING SANCTIONED VESSELS. THE VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST AND NOBEL LAUREATE TOLD BLOOMBERG IN OCTOBER THE U.S. PRESSURE ON CARACAS SHOULD FORCE PRESIDENT MADURO TO BEGIN A TRANSFER OF POWER. > > I BELIEVE THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE AND THE ESCALATION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IS THE ONLY WAY TO FORCE MADURO THAT IT IS TIME TO GO. AND THOSE THAT STILL SUPPORT HIM , WHICH ARE VERY FEW AT THIS POINT, THE TOP BRASS OF THE MILITARY, FINANCIAL ENABLERS, FRONT MEN THAT ARE MAKING HUGE ABSTAIN FORTUNES -- I'VE SEEN FORTUNES, BETTER UNDERSTAND TIME IS RUNNING OUT. I BELIEVE THIS ESCALATION IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE THAT STILL SUPPORT MADURO TO UNDERSTAND THEY NEED TO TAKE ALL SUPPORT AWAY FROM HIM AND MADURO HIMSELF TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE TO TRULY FACILITATE A PEACEFUL AND ORDER OF TRANSITION, WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT. ANNA: LIBYA'S MILITARY CHIEF OF STAFF HAS BEEN KILLED ALONGSIDE SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE IN A PLANE CRASH IN TURKEY. HE HAD BEEN RETURNING TO TRIPOLI FROM ANKARA WHEN THE PLANE REPORTED AN ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF. FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN THE MANAGING EDITOR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THIS CRASH? > > THE JET CARRYING THE LIBYAN DELEGATION CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER ITS TAKEOFF AT ABOUT 8:00 P.M. IN ANKARA THE PLANE NOTIFIED THE AIR CONTROL IT WAS SUFFERING FROM ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AND ASKED FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING BACK WHERE IT HAD TAKEN OFF FROM. PREPARATIONS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THE LANDING WHEN RADIO CONTACT WITH THE PLANE WAS LOST. ITS WRECKAGE WAS LATER FOUND IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL WITH ALL ON BOARD FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT PEOPLE INCLUDING CRUDE MEMBERS -- CREWMEMBERS, WERE KILLED. THE LIBYAN MILITARY DELEGATION WAS HEADED BY MOHAMMED ALI AHMED AL-HADDAD. HE WAS A WELL-RESPECTED FIGURE BACK IN TRIPOLI AND A KEY FIGURE IN U.N. BACK TALKS IN UNIFYING THE TWO RIVAL GOVERNMENTS IN LIBYA WHERE THE TWO ADMINISTRATIONS. ANNA: WITH THAT BACKDROP IN MIND, WHY WAS THE DELEGATION VISITING TURKEY? > > HE WAS IN ANKARA FOR DEFENSE TALKS. HIS ADMINISTRATION IN TRIPOLI HAS BEEN BACKED THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND THAT BACKING WAS MOST PRONOUNCED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO WHEN A PREDECESSOR TO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION TRIPOLI WAS UNDER ASSAULT BY FORCES IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY AND HAS SAVED ADMINISTRATION FROM COLLAPSING. SINCE THEN, ANOTHER GOVERNMENT IN THE WEST THAT HE BELONGED TO HAD BEEN OPERATING MILITARY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING PRODUCT DRONES. ONE IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN THIS REGION. THEY BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY AND WIDELY IN CONFLICTS FROM LIBYA ALDWYCH OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE WHERE THERE WAS A WAR BACK IN 2020. THE DEFENSE CORPORATION WAS THE MAIN ITEM THAT THE DELEGATION HAD COME TO ANKARA TO DISCUSS BEFORE THEY TRIED TO FLY BACK TO TRIPOLI BEFORE THE JET CRASHED. ANNA: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM COME IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL SYMBOL HAS APPROVED A STOPGAP BUDGET LAW FOR NEXT YEAR. WE WILL BRING YOU THE LATEST NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: THE CONVERSATIONS THAT MATTER AND THE INSIGHTS YOU NEED, THIS IS \"THE PULSE.\" THE FRENCH NATIONAL SYMBOL HAS APPROVED A STOPGAP BUDGET LAW FOR NEXT YEAR AFTER FAILING TO AGREE ON THE FULL FISCAL PLAN. THE SO-CALLED SPECIAL LAW EFFECTIVELY ROLLS OVER 2025 FISCAL PLANS INTO THE NEW YEAR, ALLOWING THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT TAXES AND BORROW MONEY. FOR MORE, LET'S GET TO OUR ECONOMIST AT BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS WHO JOINS US NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE FRENCH ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. WE STILL DON'T HAVE A FULL BUDGET FOR 2026, BUT ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD A FULL BUDGET? WHERE ARE THE STICKING POINTS NOW? > > THE POLITICAL SITUATION REMAINS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX. PARLIAMENT IS DEEPLY FRAGMENTED BETWEEN THE CONSERVATIVE SENATE AND THE LEFT-LEANING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. ON TOP OF THAT, POLITICAL PARTIES ARE UNWILLING TO COMPROMISE AND ARE LOOKING TO BRING HOME SOME MAJOR CONCESSIONS FROM THE GOVERNMENT LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER TAXATION ON WEALTH. UNDER BUDGET ITSELF, WE THINK A COMPROMISE IS ENRICHED AS SOME 10 BILLION EUROS OF TAX HIKES OR EXPENDITURE CUTS ARE MISSING TO ENRICH THE 5% DEFICIT CARD TO GET FOR 2026 -- TARGET FOR 2026. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE POLITICAL RISK PREMIUM IN THE MARKET IS FAILING. IF YOU LOOK AT GERMANY, IT IS BACK TO ITS AUGUST WHICH I GUESS IS QUITE A GOOD SIGN FOR THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. ANNA: YES, INDEED, THE SPREAD IN FOCUS. YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT HOW FRANCE CAN RAISE THE MONEY THAT IT NEEDS. PERHAPS SAVING BILLIONS BY BORROWING SHORT-TERM DEBT. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF GOVERNMENTS BRING FOCUS ON THE SHORT-TERM DEBT RAISING AS OPPOSED TO THE LONG END OF THE CURVE. WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THIS ANALYSIS? > > JUST TO TAKE A STEP BACK, FRANCE NEEDS TO FIND MORE THAN 100 BILLION EUROS OF SAVINGS OVER FOUR YEARS JUST TO REACH ITS COMMITMENT OF BRINGING THE BACK TO THREE PERCENT OF GDP IN 2029. TO DO THAT, MAJOR SPENDING CUTS AND PENSION REFORM AS WELL AS TAX INCREASES REMAIN CRUCIAL TO KEEP THE DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL. IN THIS CONTEXT WE CAN LOOK AT ANOTHER WAY TO SAVE MONEY AND THAT IS WHY WE LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF ISSUING SHORTER BONDS TO REDUCE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THIS WOULD BRING SOME HELP TO REDUCING INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER TIME. IT WOULD BE -- THE GAINS WOULD BE BIGGER IF THE ECB WERE TO BE A BIT MORE DOVISH. STILL, IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL. IT WOULD COME AT A HIGH COST. SOMETHING THAT LEADS US TO SAY IT WILL BE A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RISK AND SAVING MONEY. ANNA: THE ROLLOVER RISK COULD THROW UP ISSUES INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JEAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. THE ECONOMIC DATA ONCE AGAIN LEAVING INVESTORS SPLIT ON WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR MONETARY POLICY. ON ONE HAND, THE UNITED STATES, U.S. ECONOMY EXPANDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AT THE FASTEST PACE IN TWO YEARS, BOLSTERED BY RESILIENT SPENDING. ON THE OTHER HAND, A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE TOPLINE GDP DATA. THERE TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL, ARE STRATEGISTS VEN RAM. YOU HAVE DONE SOME DIGGING INTO THEIR PRINT. THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS WAS A BLOWOUT NUMBER ON GDP OUT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DEEP DIVES YET THAT REVEAL ANY SKEPTICISM. WHAT HAVE YOU UNCOVERED? > > GOOD MORNING. I THINK THE BROAD PERSPECTIVE IS YOU COULD QUIBBLE ABOUT THE ACTUAL GROWTH NUMBER BUT THE BIG PERSPECTIVE, BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE IS THE ECONOMY IS GROWING -- SEEMS TO BE FIGHTING ON ALL CYLINDERS. THAT IS A BIG TAKEAWAY. YOU'VE GOT 4.3% GROWTH EVEN ABOUT 3% FROM A 4% THEREABOUTS. I THINK U.S. ECONOMY IS DOING PRETTY WELL. THE FED EXPECTS -- THE FED HAS BOOSTED ITS OWN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH THE ECONOMY WILL GROW NEXT YEAR TO 2.3%, WELL ABOVE TREND GROWTH. HERE IS AN ECONOMY DOING PRETTY WELL. IF YOU JUXTAPOSE THAT WITH 2.8 PERCENT ON AVERAGE THIS YEAR, IT RAISES A VERY DISTURBING QUESTION. SHOULD THE FED BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES AT ALL IN THIS KIND OF SCENARIO? WHICH PART OF THE ECONOMY NEEDS RATE CUTS? IF WHERE INFLATION ISN'T AT TARGET YET, WHY ARE THEY RUSHING TO CUT RATES? THAT IS A BIG QUESTION FOR THE MARKETS TO WRESTLE WITH NEXT YEAR. ANNA: OK, AND ANOTHER QUESTION, WHETHER WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON METALS, PRECIOUS METALS IN PARTICULAR? CAN THE RALLY CONTINUE IN PRECIOUS METALS? > > IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE. IT CERTAINLY GOT MOMENTUM. THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL SEEM TO BE BUYING GOLD. SILVER IS LEADING WITH GOLD HIGHER IN PARTICULAR LIKE OF THE CYCLE. THE SUPPLY SQUEEZE CONTINUES, I THINK SILVER WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD GOLD HIGHER. MARKETS HAVE CAUGHT UNDER THIS PROPHECY THAT IT IS GOING TO GO TO $5,000 AN OUNCE. SO EVERYONE IN GOLD, EVERYONE'S CROSS HAIRS. TO AN EXTENT, THIS IS A BIT OF A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY FOR THE MARKETS. EVERYONE IN THE MARKETS EXPECTS THAT LEVEL TO BE CROSSED AND THEREFORE IT DOES LOOK LIKE WE MAY GET TO THAT LEVEL. BUT THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES A RISK-REWARD BEYOND THAT? GOLD CAN'T KEEP RISING. IT HAS RISEN 70% THIS YEAR. THAT IS THE SECOND BEST ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SINCE 1979. THE IRONY IS IF YOU BOUGHT AT THE PEAK IN 1979, IT TOOK YOU YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE YOU BROKE EVEN. I THINK INVESTORS NEED TO PAY SOME CAUTION TO HOW MUCH THEY ARE PAYING TO GET -- GOLD. ANNA: KEEP THAT FACT IN MIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO GET IN TO THIS TRADE. LOOKING AT CENTRAL BANKS IN 2026, ARE WE LOOKING AT A FULL RANGE OF HAWKS, DOVES, NEUTRAL, EVERYTHING IN THE MIX IN TERMS OF CENTRAL BANKING? > > WELL, I THINK AT LEAST A FEW THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE GOING TO BE HAWKISH. THE BANK OF AUSTRALIA AND BANK OF NEW ZEALAND ARE ALREADY SHOWING INCLINATION THEY'RE GOING TO BE A BIT HAWKISH. GET THE ECB THAT IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE NEUTRAL BECAUSE INFLATION IS A TARGET. IT IS PROBABLY THE CLEAREST READ ON WHICH CENTRAL BANK IS GOING TO STAY PUT. ALSO AVERSE TO NEGATIVE RATES SO I THINK THEY MAY STAY PUT. IN CANADA AND THE U.S. I THINK INTEREST RATES NEED TO GO HIGHER. IN CANADA, THE MARKETS ARE PRICING SOME CHANCE OF A RATE HIKE BUT IN THE U.S., AS YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE THINKING AND THE MARKETS ARE THINKING INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN BECAUSE OF WHAT TRUMP WANTS . WE WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES. IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING 2026 FOR THE RATES MARKETS FOR SURE. ANNA: COMPLEX FOR ALL OF THE USUAL REASONS AND A SPRINKLING OF POLITICS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE LATEST ON SOME OF THE CENTRAL BANK THINKING AS WE HEAD INTO 2026. A QUICK WORD ON THE MARKETS, QUITE FLAT ON EUROPEAN EQUITIES. NOT MANY OF THE EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE OPEN. WE ARE OPEN IN LONDON, PARIS, AMSTERDAM. GERMANY IS CLOSED, SWITZERLAND IS CLOSE, MANY OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN MARKETS AND NORTHERN EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE CLOSED MOST OF U.S. FUTURES POINTING TO TOUCH LOWER. IT IS CHRISTMAS EVE. HAVE A GOOD HOLIDAY, EVERYBODY.

GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT NEW HIGHS -- AND MERRY CHRISTMAS DO YOU -- WHAT NEW HIGHS WE CAN HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY MARKETS NEXT YEAR? CAMERON: GOOD MORNING AND MERRY CHRISTMAS. IT IS TIME TO DUST OFF THE OLD ADAGE WHICH IS RESPECT THE TREND BUT DON'T IGNORE THE RISKS AS ARE GOING TO 2026. RESPECTING THE TREND APPRECIATES THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL IN AN UPTREND IN THE MARKET, AND IT IS BEING LED BY PROCYCLICAL AREAS. YOU MENTIONED INDUSTRIAL COMMODITIES. YOU ALSO HAVE LEADERSHIP WITH THINGS LIKE BANKS, TRANSPORT STARTING TO TURN HIGHER, SO THERE IS A PROCYCLICAL MESSAGE COMING OUT OF THE MARKET, AND YOU ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT UPTREND IN EARNING ESTIMATES AND GDP ESTIMATES, AND THIS HAS BEEN THE KEY FUNDAMENTAL UNDERPINNING OF WHY WE KEEP GETTING TO WRESTLE WITH NEW HIGHS. AS LONG AS YOU REVISE ESTIMATES HIGHER, THERE'S USUALLY A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR TAKING. THE SECOND HALF OF THAT IS DO NOT IGNORE THE RISKS. THAT IS WHERE WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE VALUATIONS AND SIGNS OF COMPLACENCY IS WITHIN MARKETS, LOOK AT THE VIX TURNING EVER LOWER EACH AND EVERY DAY, SO IT COULD BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE STILL ABLE TO CARVE OUT NEW HIGHS BECAUSE OF THE EARNINGS ESTIMATES, BUT THERE COULD BE SOME VOLATILITY ALONG THE WAY, SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A HIGH MARK WITH VALUATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS, AS WELL. ANNMARIE: BUT YOU THINK POSITIONING IS NOT STRETCHED. WHAT WOULD GET US TO THAT POINT? CAMERON: OUR FAVORITE MEASURE IS LOOKING AT THE DEUTSCHE BANK CONSOLIDATED EQUITY POSITIONING, MEASURING INSTITUTIONAL POSITION. WHAT IS FASCINATING IS WE ARE IN THE 62ND PERCENTILE, SLIGHTLY OVERWEIGHT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT DISCRETIONARY INVESTORS, THEY ARE STILL JUST NEUTRAL. WE THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR MORE PEOPLE TO GET DRAGGED INTO THE MARKET, BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONING, WE HAVE TO MENTION HOUSEHOLDS AND THAT IS WHERE YOU CANNOT MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE UNDERWEIGHT EQUITIES. YOU COULD LOOK AT THE SURVEY THAT LOOKS AT THE POSITIONING. THAT IS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT HAS BEEN SINCE 2018 AND 2022. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MARGIN LOANS HAVE GROWN EXTRAORDINARILY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS AT ABOUT A 40% CLIP, SO THERE ARE SIGNS THAT HOUSEHOLDS ARE FULLY INVESTED, BUT SOME INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS HAVE STILL SAT ON THE SIDELINES, WHICH IS LIKELY WHY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR SO, EVERY DIP HAS GOTTEN BOUGHT SO QUICKLY. SCARLET: TALK ABOUT THE MONEY ON THE SIDELINES, THE DRY POWDER IF THEY WILL. WE TALKED ABOUT MANY MARKET FUNDS AND HOW THERE ARE 70 TRILLION FORMS OF DOLLARS WAITING TO BE DEPLOYED. MAYBE RETAIL INVESTORS ARE FULLY INVESTED, BUT THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD PUT MORE INTO THE MARKET. HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THAT MONEY TO BE PUT TO WORK? CAMERON: WE NEVER CONSIDERED THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS AS FUNGIBLE THAT COULD GO INTO EQUITIES, MEANING THAT THESE WERE SAVINGS AND CASH BALANCES THAT WERE TYPICALLY HELD IN CASH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS VERSUS THINGS THAT WERE JUST ANXIOUS AND WAITING TO GO INTO EQUITIES. SO MAYBE AT THE MARGIN, AS YOU SEE THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS START TO FALL, IT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT LINE STRAIGHT INTO THE EQUITY MARKET. CERTAINLY MONEY MARKET RATES FALLING COULD PUSH INVESTORS INTO LOOKING INTO OTHER AREAS INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING ON THE SIDELINES AND CLIPPING COUPONS -- CLIPPING COUPONS BUT NOT NECESSARILY $7 TRILLION THAT WILL GO INTO EQUITIES. SCARLET: THE CENTER RALLY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, HOW MUCH IS DRIVEN BY TECHNICAL FACTORS LIKE POSITIONING VERSUS TRUE FUNDAMENTALS, EARNINGS GROWTH, AND THE EARNINGS OUTLOOK FOR 2026? CAMERON: THIS TIME OF YEAR WE TRY NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO THE PRICE ACTION GIVEN VOLUME IS SO LIGHT. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE TENDS TO BE SOME KIND OF WINDOWDRESSING AND POSITIONING CHASES TO YEAR END, BUT WHAT IS FASCINATING IS WE SAW THE ROTATION AND LEADERSHIP START A LITTLE EARLY THIS YEAR. TYPICALLY WE SEE LEADERSHIP ROTATIONS WE HAVE YOUR CLASSIC DOWEL, OR THE FIRST TRADE THAT KICKS OFF IN JANUARY AS PEOPLE START TO REBALANCE PORTFOLIOS, BUT IT SEEMED TO START IN NOVEMBER THIS YEAR, WHERE WE SOLVE VALUE, FOR EXAMPLE, OUTPERFORM GROWTH BY 5% SINCE NOVEMBER 1, SO MAYBE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF THAT, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE TRY NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO IT AND LIVE YOUR KIND OF PRICE ACTION, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REFLECT ANYTHING MORE THAN LIKELY POSITIONING CHASING. ANNMARIE: WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMODITY SPACE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM, GOLD, SILVER, PLATINUM, COPPER, DO YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THINK YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN PART OF THIS INTO 2026 OR DO YOU THINK INDIVIDUAL SHOULD MAKE SURE COMMODITIES ARE PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIO? CAMERON: WE SEE COMMODITIES AS A WAY TO HAVE AN INFLATION HEDGE WITHIN PORTFOLIOS, AND THEY WORK REALLY WELL WHEN THEY WORK WELL AND THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL THE GOOD PORTION OF THE TIME, SO WE HAVE BEEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THAT HAS BEEN A VERY POWERFUL UPTREND FOR A LOT OF THESE COMMODITIES. I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH CAN I CONTINUE? DR. GRAFF OF RENAISSANCE MACRO PUT OUT A GREAT PIECE EFFECTIVELY SAYING, WHEN YOU DOUBLED YOUR RETURN IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, THE PROBABILITY OF YOU DOING IT AGAIN IS EXTRAORDINARILY LOW, SO IT GETS BACK TO THIS OVERALL NOTION OF WE ARE NOT IGNORING RISKS. GOLD HAS HAD A POWERFUL UPTREND, THE CHUCK MORSE OF COMMODITIES. NOTHING SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT DOWN, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT LONGER TERM CHARTS, IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY OVERBOUGHT, SO IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING TO SEE SOME KIND OF CONSOLIDATION, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE STILL REMAINS POWERFUL DRIVERS. FOR EXAMPLE, CENTRAL BANK BUYING OF GOLD, BUT ALSO IT HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT 5, MEANING THAT IT HAS BECOME EFFECTIVELY AND MOMENTUM STOCK WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF TRADING IN RETAIL INVESTORS, AS WELL AS INVESTORS OVERSEAS, SO IT COULD GET A LITTLE OVER", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:14:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T15:27:45.616044"}

The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a reading of 53.5.\n“Despite some signs of improvement to close out the year, sentiment remains nearly 30% below December 2024, as pocketbook issues continue to dominate consumer views of the economy,” Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement.\nThe current conditions gauge slid to a record-low of 50.4, while a gauge of expectations climbed to a four-month high. Consumers’ perception of current buying conditions for big-ticket items deteriorated to the lowest on record. Will Auchincloss, Americas Retail Sector Leader at EY-Parthenon, breaks down the state of the consumer. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nConsumers are showing in our monthly surveys that they're getting less and less confident in the economy as the year wears on. And there's several factors that are driving that. One is the job outlook. The biggest reason now, however, is inflation and the continued pressure on essential categories like food, housing, even debt now is sort of emerging as a topic for consumers. And so they are trying to muscle through this environment as best as they can. And that is weighing on the retail sector. And it's it's weighing a little bit on the holiday season as well. But we're seeing some pretty good numbers out of some of the retailers. I mean, I'm seeing, you know, probably three or 4% retail sales growth here in the holiday season with the e-commerce even higher than that. It seems like consumers are still spending, though. They are, Paul, and they are trying to spend on the holiday and kind of keep that basket together as best they can. But there's some underlying factors that make the headline data a little bit more, more nuanced. So the majority of what we're seeing is that that those year over year gains are driven primarily by price actions and not volume. And in fact, in our headline outlook for the for the holiday season, we sort of forecasted about a 2 to 3% year over year growth rate. I think it's coming in a little bit higher, which is good news. But the majority of that is driven by price. Almost two thirds of that is driven by price and not volume. So, you know, as a retail sector, you like to see more volume going out the door historically. And so again, it's a little bit softer. I think part of that is certain chains have really resonated with consumers this this holiday season. They've gotten the value equation better aligned to expectations. And there is some channel switching happening that appears in our survey as well. We're seeing that increase as as consumers want to sort of shop what they've always shop for, but get a better price for it in whatever channel is best suited for them. Yeah, we were talking about somebody earlier talking about shopping earlier in the show and how consumers have become much more intentional about what it is they're spending their money on. But let's talk about restaurants and bars and how we're spending on that. I mean, how did you talk about that in the survey and what did you guys find out? We do. And that that sector in particular is getting much better, is facing much more significant headwinds because it's the first category consumers repeatedly tell us they're going to pull back on. And then and indeed, we're we're seeing that in some of the top line numbers, albeit there are a couple really exciting sort of turnaround stories in the sector that I think shows that point about aligning with consumers. But in general, consumers, the number one category they want to pull back on is eating out, particularly at higher end establishments. And so when they're paying more for groceries and the basics, it kind of makes sense that they would switch to to more in-home eating. And so that really is putting a pressure on restaurants and the QSR space. We've seen a lot of revamped emphasis on value and value menus to try and stem that tide. But it has been a tough year for for the restaurant sector in general, and we don't expect that to change much going into 2026. Will What's typically an anecdote to consumer spending concerns? I'm not sure it's the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points, and it seems like the economy is essentially fully employed. What needs to change here? Yeah, I think it's a couple of things. One is that they have to have more confidence. And, you know, with all the change in the policies coming out of out of the federal government with concerns about inflation really showing up in their, you know, the receipts and some concerns about the economic outlook and a little bit of a I it's it's a it's sort of a psychological aspect of this that's really weighed on the sector. However, there are some real economic drivers because a lot of the GDP growth we're seeing is driven by what we call the three A's. So that's affluent consumers. That's asset price realization in the stock market and. It's so I'm forgetting the third day it's AI driven investment which is dealing the the the sort of the stock price appreciation. So that's propping up a lot of this. And affluent consumers in particular are really need to kind of continue that that that spending pattern as we go into 2026 if we're going to continue at the levels we're content seen today and with in terms of how we're paying for these things and, you know, consumers taking on debt, especially during the holiday season, I know that they're using a lot more buy now, pay later platforms, and that could be troubling down the road. Yeah, that that is a concern for us to monitor. And and savings in general has declined since Liberation Day. Again, as consumers try and buy what they've always purchased, but in the face of higher prices. So we've gone from a savings economy to a debtor economy, and that shows up in the macro data. That is a potential risk in the outlook for for 2026, because the question is how long can they keep doing that? And those debt levels have sort of increased generally across all income segments as well. So it's not just centered in one income segment. That's not we're not reaching sort of crisis levels by any stretch, but it is another potential headwind as we cross into next year.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:50:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T16:32:44.108471"}
{"title": "TheRealReal Sees Resilient Consumers", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-12-24/therealreal-sees-resilient-consumers-video", "summary": "Rati Levesque, The RealReal President & CEO, Bloomberg Open Interest with Vonnie Quinn and Emily Graffeo to speak to the strength of the US consumer. Levesque says the secondary luxury market is strong as more customers look for value. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWe're seeing the buyer be quite resilient at the REALREAL. We're seeing consumer trends being quite strong around fine jewelry, watches, handbags. We're definitely probably a tariff beneficiary, but at the same time, there's other things kind of impacting our business. Resale is becoming more mainstream. That's number one. And definitely seeing that led by the Gen Z and millennial consumer. We're seeing fine jewelry and watches be very popular, like I mentioned, gold pricing, silver pricing going up. And then we're also seeing gifting becoming less of a stigma of resale. So almost 60% of consumers now say they prefer the secondary market outright. So seeing lingerie and seeing resale specifically becoming much more mainstream right now. Now you've been aggressively cost cutting, restructuring your commissioned model and so on. Is there any danger that you will maybe not get in the supply that you need in order to keep supplying this market? Yeah. So, you know, it's interesting. I think that one one of the things is that there's $200 billion trapped in people's closets. That's just in the U.S. alone. And so we're it's such an untapped industry. At the end of the day, $80 billion gets added to that every year. So, so much got so much luxury goods just in the U.S. alone. And so many of these people have never consigned anything before. So we're seeing people become kind of introduced to luxury for the first time. So double digit new seller growth, for example. So people are really starting to change the way they shop and they're checking the prices in the secondary market before they're even purchasing in the primary market. I wanted to talk about prices, Brodie, because our very own Amanda Bloomberg wrote just a few days ago, 2019, the price of a Chanel flat bag, $5,800. Fast forward to right now, it's over $11,000. I'm wondering just how much the growth of the real real is coming out of the fact that people feel like they just can't they can't stomach the prices in the luxury market. Yes, there's a couple of things happening. Any time the price increases in the primary market. Our pricing goes up, too. So for whatever reasons, whether it's tariffs, whether the pricing of a Chanel that goes up, for whatever reason, our prices go up as well. But like I said, what we're also seeing is more volume coming through. So more people being introduced to luxury and testing it out and then they get that first paycheck, right? They get that first paycheck for the bag and then they go back into the primary market. What we're actually seeing is that circular economy. And so they'll go back into the primary market with their check and buy the newest trend or buy something that they've been eyeing, and then they'll consign two or three things instead. So we'll see that kind of trade up happening as well. And what are the consumers typically gravitating for on the real, real? Are they looking for a bargain on a classic luxury item or are they turning to secondhand markets when they want to buy something trendier? Yeah, So we're seeing that intersection between value and luxury. That's what we offer right at the end of the day. And then you've got very unique items and most of our items you can't buy anywhere else. So they're looking for those one of a kind pieces. You know, they're kind of maybe done with the trends or everything starting to look the same. It's a badge of honor to wear something very unique from the real world. So think of them like drops. Thousands of items get dropped everyday that are very unique to the consumer consumers. That's number one. Buying jewelry, like I mentioned, watches, handbags, vintage is a big one, as is condition. Again, seeing more of that value play come through. People are looking for that value. They'll take something that maybe is in better condition instead of pristine condition, just that it costs a little less at the end of the day. You know, there are competitors out there now, fashion file, rebuy and so on. How do you compete with them? Yeah. So, you know, when I think about the real, real, it's really around we offer very in-depth in product. So we don't offer just one category, right? It's handbags, it's jewelry, watches, fashion, textiles, silverware, all of that we're offering at the real, real. So there's a lot of and then we give you cash up front. And that's really important, right? Versus trade up or trading and then you earn the most with us. And that's really important to say. And the reason why is because of the trust that we built with the consumer. Because we know because you can sign with us, because we've got almost 50 million members now that we built trust with because of our pricing algorithm. Yes, you can earn the most with us at the end of the day. I'm curious as well, how much are your physical stores contributing? Are they contributing to the bottom line? And, you know, is it just a marketing play at the end of the day? And when does that bottom line, by the way, turn positive? Yeah. So the stores pay back very quickly, actually. And what we see is a halo impact. So it's meeting the consignor where they are, whether they want to drop off in the store on their way to work, whether they want a van pick up at 3 p.m. this afternoon on demand, they'll can book that from their app. And we're seeing the consignor the seller can more items when they interact with the store and more high value items because they're meeting with a gemologist and watchmaker. So yes, it's a place that people get introduced to our being, our brand, where a quarter of our new consignors come from, the stores, from our retail locations. But we more see a halo impact. So from the Consignor consigning more for us with us and then spending more at the end of the day to.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:38:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T16:57:25.170853"}

Wilson also said that for tricky post-holiday tasks like returning or exchanging gifts, consumers are turning to chatbots for help. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nI think they were. But I think overall you're kind of view of a mere holiday might have been the word of the day. So so holiday was stronger than expected. We saw consumer spend the results coming out higher than analysts had predicted. But I would say it was kind of a you know, at least in my house, what we call that was the year of the sweater. So it was a very practical holiday spending, Hey, you know, withheld all of the headwinds, but it didn't give anybody a ton of surprises. You know, I think things were very practical that the smart consumer kind of played out. What was ours was socks. The socks. Yeah. How bad is that? Or you know what? SNL had a great skit. They always do it. It was a it's an old skit, but they did it where the mom gets a robe every year, but everybody else in the family gets like really cool gifts. And she's like, I have another robe, so I feel you on the sweater robe socks thing. But what about gift cards? I remember when they were sort of all the rage, people were going out and buying gift cards because they didn't know what else to do. Do you think that was a thing? Because it crept up on them? Yeah, absolutely. So I think gift cards and we'll really see where the consumer plays out in terms of the categories because of the gift card trend. I think a lot of people, the sentiment, you know, and and actually we have fewer days between Black Friday and Christmas Day this year. So a lot of people, it caught them by surprise. And so gift card as the gift of choice is definitely something that we predicted with our consumer poll survey and then actually played out. So I think you'll see a lot of spend over this weekend to see if, you know, if electronics kind of nudge ahead or if people are still using the gift card to get the things that they kind of were or holding out on just as they were, you know, a bit spendthrift over the period like this, You know, that area is a big time concern because right behind her is a whiteboard. And whenever a whiteboard is brought out in the meeting I'm in, I get up and I leave. Thank you very much. I may translate. It's actually a painting, but yeah, I get the whiteboards. On the other side of the room there is a whiteboard and lots of business books as well. How they do it, that's how the consultants think. They're big time out of the box. We haven't had a retailers reach their consumers these days. I mean, I mean, you know, how do you reach a John Tucker who's not at the beck and call of influencers on social media? So, you know, the new retail strategy is definitely being where the consumer is. So omnichannel demand is kind of the thing. And finding them, whether you're you do like to see it in your feeds or the traditional social media outlets of Facebook, Instagram, etc., are not gone. Chat, Jeep, Gemini, everything, making sure that you're searchable there and that it's easy to to click through is kind of the second area to take. This is the first year that we really saw a I take off from a consumer perspective and then the traditional ad, it's not gone. You know, there's some of us that are still in, you know, we watch TV, we watch it, you know, we do things on YouTube, etc.. And so finding that that perfect mix is is complex. But we have a lot more tools today to get in front of the consumer. All right. Who here is doing dry January dry January being that you don't drink for the month of June, please. It's like wine I've heard you know sprinkle January is another thing our consumer survey said about one in three Americans are participating in dry January. It's for health reasons is the number one reason. But the second reason is to spend less money. So I think we if that if we aren't knocked over the head with the thing of the frugal consumer, we're continuing to see that even as we head into dry January. But it is a restrained consumer thinking about health and wellness for sure. You know, I it has kind of seeped into all aspects of our lives, all aspects of the economy. How are retailers, how our consumers using air in their purchasing? I have to tell you, as a last minute shopper, I does not bring the package to your door. So that's one thing that we could maybe look for in the future. If you're buying in the last 10 hours of the holiday shopping spree, then you do need to go in a store and physically pick it up. But I think is helpful. And, you know, we just mentioned that the returns that are about to happen. So figuring out where to to go, how to print a label, some of those really tactical things that you would have to sift through and try to figure out is helping the consumer on that side. But from the retailers perspective, you know, we can't forget just how important it is for them to use it to drive productivity and enhance personalization. So KPMG, we talk about the front, middle and back. Office II is really helping us do some of those things of, you know, the the chats to when when a consumer has a question about how to put together a toy or where to return.

There's certainly been a build up of narrative coming from the administration that there was atrocities involving Christians in Nigeria, and it wasn't the work of ISIS. Now, the US government, at the behest of the Nigerian government, takes action. Yes, this really came as a surprise, particularly this that, you know, in the eve of Christmas Day there being this strike on this Islamic State site in Nigeria. And as you noted, this was done in conjunction with the Nigerian intelligence services and and military. But the Nigerian government is really pushing back hard on the narrative that there is religious persecution happening in the country. They said, yes, there are terrorist attacks happening. This is a problem, but that Christians and Muslims are both both targeted in these. You know, this is really a narrative we've seen from Washington. You know, Trump has mentioned several times he's worried about the persecution of Christians. We even have Ted Cruz in the Senate who's tried to get Nigeria labeled as a as a country that is persecuted Christians. But this, you know, kind of the narrative, at least here, you know, that really appeals to the MAGA base doesn't actually match what we're seeing in terms of the actual conditions on the ground. More broadly, are we expecting anything to escalate from here? We we know that there has been this move made. Is it sort of meant to be a preemptive strike to iron out any further risks of escalation or acts of atrocity or terrorism that's occurring in the country? We don't know exactly what more is to come, though. We do know that there will be something. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said yesterday that there would be more of these attacks to come. Exactly The timing, the tenor, the location are all still very unclear. But this is what we are seeing is a real ramp up of U.S. military strikes across the globe that were strikes in Syria last week, of course, the build up in Venezuela.

Almost. Pegging a crypto token’s value to a real-world currency (almost always the dollar) makes it look like money. But even with one-for-one reserve backing — as mandated by the Trump administration’s Genius Act, passed in July — its relationship to money remains one step removed. Not everyone wants to be confronted by foundational concepts like singleness and supply elasticity while buying groceries.\n\nPayment rails? Almost. There is a logic to putting dollars on the blockchain, particularly in the US, where merchant fees are artificially high. Small payment systems work just fine nearly everywhere else, however, so stablecoins for daily use looks like a solution seeking a problem.\n\nRemittance systems? Almost. Some may value moving money across borders, 24/7, without the friction of security checks. But while a clearing house may cost more, it provides someone to blame if something goes wrong.\n\nExchange traded funds? Almost. But ETF issuers rely on independent auditors and custodians. Stablecoin issuers such as Tether, the world’s biggest, prefer a more DIY approach.\n\nThe point here is that many money-like products already exist. They are tightly regulated and issued under conventions hardened by crises. Stablecoins were born of a desire to bring new customers to the crypto casino. Secondary uses like funding illicit trade stem directly from regulatory ambiguity.\n\nStablecoins may benefit the US, which has a lot of dollar-denominated debt to sell. The challenge for others countries is to justify why private money should exist alongside their own currencies, while resisting the temptation to regulate stablecoins like something they are not.\n\nbryce.elder@ft.com", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 05:00:16 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T05:27:08.120964"}

And you never know—a few of them could even have a breakout moment you’ll find yourself humble-bragging about.\n\nOn this episode of Trillions, Eric Balchunas and Joel Weber are joined by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Athanasios Psarofagis and James Seyffart, who helped write the team’s annual report. The episode features 16 ETFs, including the tickers BINC, XOVR, MSOS, BUFB, UFOD, OTGL, VXUS, SBIL, RSST, SPYM, BOXX, GRFT, ITB, PXUI, PCLN and LRND.\n\n\n\nMoney goes where it’s treated best. That simple truth is a big reason why more and more money (trillions of dollars, in fact) flows into a powerful, low-cost tool that’s quietly transformed investing.

Photo: Yevgen Romanenko By Sam Potter January 1, 2026\n\nAstronomical expenditure. Uncertain rates of return. Uneven pace of adoption.\n\nBy now every firm on Wall Street is well aware of the risks surrounding the artificial intelligence boom. But when it comes to the year ahead, few advocate walking away from what they describe as a “revolutionary” technology. Across the investment outlooks from more than 60 institutions compiled here by Bloomberg News, the optimism is almost universal.\n\nFidelity International calls AI “the defining theme for equity markets” in 2026. The BlackRock Investment Institute says the tech will likely “keep trumping tariffs and traditional macro drivers.” NatWest spies “a powerful engine of economic expansion.” Even the most bearish firm — BCA Research, which warns of a potential US recession — stays neutral on stocks for now on the tailwind of AI’s huge capital expenditure.\n\n“The biggest risk, to us, is not having exposure to this transformational technology,” JPMorgan Wealth Management says.\n\nSee the all the calls for 2026 ↓\n\nWhen it comes to risks to the outlook, the worries are conventional. Geopolitics. Trade barriers. A weakening US labor market (BCA’s chief concern). But with the AI boom holding up, the Federal Reserve seen loosening monetary policy, and further support arriving in the shape of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and Germany’s fiscal stimulus, the general consensus is for the global expansion to rumble on.\n\n“Regional policy shifts suggest a more supportive macro backdrop for global growth in 2026,” writes State Street. “With an inflation trajectory trending lower, US policy rates likely to fall as the Fed takes stock of a softening labor market, and policy levers turning stimulative, we have a supportive environment for risk assets.”\n\nStill, optimism over returns has a limit. Valuations of key assets remain elevated, with many equities looking pricey and credit spreads extremely tight. US tariffs remain in place, acting as a brake on global growth. Inflation is still not vanquished.\n\n“There is a disconnect between the positive short-term environment for risk assets, and a broader structural instability,” says Fidelity. “Global fragmentation, a depreciating dollar, US Federal Reserve independence, and AI capex trends are themes to watch in 2026 and beyond.”\n\nBloomberg’s annual compilation of outlooks for the year ahead features more than 700 calls, presented here for easy analysis and comparison. They talk of an environment where the AI spend and government policies are adding fuel to growth at an unusual stage of the business cycle. They argue inflation won’t quite be tamed as a result, and that central banks may not have the room to maneuver that markets currently expect. Private assets will continue their ascent. The dollar will continue its decline.\n\nThe calls have been divided into sections covering the key themes and assets. Each section has a short summary, and the calls will load in approximate order based on the level of conviction displayed (highest-conviction calls appearing first). The filtering tool will allow you to view the calls from multiple specific institutions at once.\n\nThis is what the finance world’s best and brightest see in the year ahead.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 22:00:09 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T22:26:37.952863"}

Bill Shufelt, the Co-Founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing joined Bloomberg TV and radio to talk about the outlook for NA beer in the new year and how his brand is trying to redefine how we drink. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nBill Shufelt is the co-founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing Company. I'm sure you've seen those cans in the stores or perhaps at your local bar. It's one of the nation's top non-alcoholic beer brands. He joins us now in studio to talk about what's on tap for booze, less suds. So, Bill, this is an insane growth story that you've just been telling me. So you started actually, what, ten years ago and now you're ten X or the market is ten X. Explain what you were just telling us for sure. It's it's been a really fun ride. We started the non-alcoholic beer market basically and flatlined for 30 years before ten years ago where we came in and like to think we reimagined both the product and the marketing of the category, taking it out of the penalty box into the mainstream with delicious flavors. And we've taken it as a category from about 100 million to passing ,000,000,000 in the US market this year. And we think that could continue to grow. We expected to five X in the next ten years with athletic being 25% of that market. Right now athletic is about 18.4 share the total category. The next biggest is about 14 and a half share, and that's another four point drop to the next brand behind that. Athletics also 52 share of the non-alcoholic craft beer category, which has well over 100 brands. So we're outselling the next 100 plus combined. And it's really meeting those that next generation of consumers where they're at. What's been the response, competitor response from some of the big brewers, which I can't even know the names now, they've all merged into like one big entity, I think for sure. So as you've heard on the segment before, two of over 40% of consumers are doing dry. January this year, Over 50% of consumers now view one or two drinks a day as unhealthy, and a record low number of Americans are also consuming alcohol on a weekly basis. So this is a huge growth opportunity for the adult beverage market. And a lot of companies were late to that. But over the last five years, basically every major brand has entered that category with that alcoholic analog to there are non-alcoholic analog to their full strength version. And we really appreciate that support and growing the category because it's so funny to me because I didn't have an alcoholic beverage in my life until I was nearly 30, I think. And I wonder what makes somebody reach for a non-alcoholic beer when there are so many other drinks that are already non-alcoholic out there? For sure. It's so when we started athletic and I would try to get people to taste samples or buy one of our beers, getting people to cross that barrier was so hard seven or eight years ago. But I think the lightbulb that goes on over and over again for people is that it is such a delicious meal pairing at a fraction of the calories as a full strength alcohol equivalent. For example, we were just talking about before I came in, how our athletic light is 25 calories, no sugar, light and carbs, but a full taste that's like a perfect guilt free weeknight beer. And then we brought a ton of innovation to the market, too. For example, we're now launching an excited lineup of non-alcoholic brewed cocktails this January at select retailers like Target and all these different fun flavored and like, well, give us a foretaste. Yeah. So we have after the athletic light lager, we have an athletic lite Lyman Salt launching this year and in a typical year we launch almost 50 different styles of beers on our website. Athletic Brewing become where before Athletic Brewing this category was a lager only category. So from day one, we've really blown the lid off what taste and availability can be in this category. Who's a typical athletic drinker customer? So when we came into the category, this category was typically a lapsed alcohol drinker. It was very male heavy as the older population generally. And since we've redefined the product and marketing of the category, we've seen that drift younger and younger. Every year. We think 45% of our consumers are below age 45, very heavy in Gen Z. Consumers really, as people have grown up in this digital generation where you have your work in your pocket at all times, everything in your life is filmed and recorded and on record and people still like to drink, but then they like the zebra stripe and working non-alcoholic options to super stripping. And I heard that and I forgot it already. Yeah, sorry I jumped right over that. It's basically we and this has been shocking to me. I hear from bartenders all the time that people order alcoholic drinks non-alcoholic alcohol. Oh, okay, I got it. Okay. That's a brilliant idea. You can put food in there to know for sure. Better idea. Curious. How do you do it? You have so many options and as you say, you're trying out different ones all the time. I mean, are you very non-profitable or how does it work? That costs a lot of money? Well, at the end of the day, in our retail lineup, we're very focused. We have a core group of about five beers, which are very popular and highly awarded. We won 33 Taste awards last year alone and have won about 185 Taste awards since. You know, there's there's been a plethora of entrants into this category from major brewers to there's been ten celebrity brands with more on the way and. Almost none of these companies make their own beer. Where athletic has gone the other way, we invested 130 million and our own manufacturing, our brewing quality teams. And ultimately consumers like to know they they want to get the best products and like to know what's behind their products. And after that celebrity hype, they've really loved what they found in athletic. And so we really try to stay focused on our retail lineup and bring people the best beers over and over again. I got to put my investment banker hat back on. How do you capitalize your company? I'm always fascinated to see how these private companies, entrepreneurial companies, how they finance themselves. Yeah, it's such an interesting I like I came from the financial world. It's such an interesting world these days between private and public capital. And we've been so fortunate to have great access to private capital, from angel investors to private equity investors like airlines, consumer growth and General Atlantic. And an institutional investor encouraged Dr. Pepper. And that's afforded us the opportunity over the past eight years to invest 30 million into our U.S. manufacturing base. Non-alcoholic brews and taprooms weren't a thing before athletic in the country. We built the first one, and since then we've built them that are 100 times the output of the original brewery on both coasts and in that world. We have found really good access to private to capital in the private markets. But ultimately it is really exciting for us to think about potentially being a public company or running a long term private company. Yeah, I want to ask you more about that. But first I say the marketing is brilliant because you're you know, you're a non holic brewery, but you're targeting athletes and people who go for hikes and, you know, serious mountaineers and dog lovers and outdoorsy people. I mean, it's just it's amazing. So what is the trajectory that you see before going public? I mean, are you going to open breweries around the country? Are you going to have, you know, bars? Is that is that something that can be profitable not to the bottom line or, you know, is it better to have people just subscribe and sort of have, you know, beer as a service south jersey? Yeah, Well, in terms of our target customer, we basically built the target customer around my lifestyle because I was authentically living this as a busy professional love the outdoors that is, 70% of the population considers themself an athlete, even though you'll never find me on any podiums anywhere. I love being out there and participating. And so it was really about that health and wellness trend. And then, yeah, beyond that, our our awareness is still very low. It's about 25% nationally. So we have and our distribution is only about 39% with our top product where a lot of the major beer companies, even in our category, even though athletics the number one, have double our distribution. So we have a huge amount of awareness and distribution to go over the next five, ten years. And that allows us we also are trying to open the aperture to who drinks beer, where beer over the past 30 years had been marketing to smaller and smaller audiences. And so this January bring plans to we're working with OpenTable with a big partnership to expand into the culinary world. Chefs and athletes and stuff. Build awesome stuff. Great story. We really appreciate you taking the time out. Come to visit us.

How did hedge funds do in general and what strategies did best? I mean, these are all very initial numbers. It's just day one of the new year, the first working days. So we still don't know many of the numbers. But looking at initial figures, it seems that 2025 proved to be a very, very strong year for some of the largest hedge funds in the world hedge fund as a whole. They seem to be heading to record their best returns since in at least five years. And with some luck, it may be the best year since 2009. Even if they make on an average about one percentage point, then, you know, we are looking at returns which are best since 2009. And a lot was going in favour of some of these largest hedge funds who are very well risk managed. You know, you had, you know, tariffs and trade war that induced volatility across markets. Stocks surged. You were just talking about AIG. So that definitely helped a lot of hedge funds. Then you had precious metals doing well and bond and currencies switching. So all combined to create this like sort of a perfect spring for hedge funds in 2025. Yeah, I don't think they should be patting themselves on the back. I mean, everybody made money seemingly in 2025. Stocks, bonds, us, non-U.S. commodities everywhere. What strategies, Nishant, are kind of outperforming and maybe what strategies are underperforming do we see in 25? I mean, it's hard to say which strategies underperforming. Most of them versus their own history are doing well, but it's led by equities. Macro has done really well in most of the cases, especially the emerging market, macro focused hedge funds. They have done very, very well. Most of them are in double digits. So, yeah, I mean, and the Multi-strategy as well, I mean, they don't focus just on one share asset classes, but they invest across asset classes run by dozens of teams. And some of the returns they are, you know, that they produce are really, really strong. Most of them are in double digits. And also, it's important to look from the lens of these macro hedge funds and multi strat, which we have included in our table. They are all very large hedge funds.

Shufelt highlighted that the U.S. market has grown from $100 million to over $1 billion in the past decade, with Athletic holding an 18.4% share and leading the craft segment. He attributed growth to shifting consumer preferences, especially among younger and health-conscious demographics, and noted that over 40% of consumers participate in Dry January. Shufelt outlined ongoing innovation, significant investment in manufacturing, and future plans for broader distribution, partnerships, and possibly going public. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIt's been a really fun ride. We started the non-alcoholic beer market, basically flatlined, flatline for 30 years before ten years ago where we came in and like to think we reimagined both the product and the marketing of the category, taking it out of the penalty box into the mainstream with delicious flavors. And we've taken it as a category from about 100 million to passing $1,000,000,000 in the US market this year. And we think that could continue to grow. We expected to five X in the next ten years with athletic being 25% of that market. Right now athletic is about 18.4 share the total category. The next biggest is about 14 and a half share, and that's another four point drop to the next brand behind that. Athletics also 52 share of the non-alcoholic craft beer category, which has well over 100 brands. So we're outselling the next 100 plus combined. And it's really meeting those that next generation of consumers where they're at. What's been the response, competitor response from some of the big brewers, which I can't even know the names now, they've all merged into like one big entity, I think for sure. So as you've heard on the segment before, two of over 40% of consumers are doing dry January this year. Over 50% of consumers now view one or two drinks a day as unhealthy. And a record low number of Americans are also consuming alcohol on a weekly basis. So this is a huge growth opportunity for the adult beverage market. And a lot of companies were late to that. But over the last five years, basically every major brand has entered that category with the alcoholic analog to there are non-alcoholic analog to the full strength version. And we really appreciate that support and growing the category. It's it's so funny to me because I didn't have an alcoholic beverage in my life until I was nearly 30, I think. And I wonder what makes somebody reach for a non-alcoholic beer when there are so many other drinks that are already non-alcoholic out there? For sure. It's so when we started athletic and I would try to get people to taste samples or buy one of our beers, getting people to cross that barrier was so hard seven or eight years ago. But I think the lightbulb that goes on over and over again for people is that it is such a delicious meal pairing at a fraction of the calories as a full strength alcohol equivalent. For example, we were just talking about before I came in, how our athletic light is 25 calories, no sugar, light and carbs, but a full taste that's like a perfect guilt free weeknight beer. And then we brought a ton of innovation to the market, too. For example, we're now launching an excited lineup of non-alcoholic brewed cocktails this January at select retailers like Target and all these different fun flavored and like, well, it give us a foretaste. Yeah. So we have after the athletic light lager we have an athletic lite Lyman Salt launching this year and in a typical year we launch almost 50 different styles of beers on our website. Athletic Brewing become where before Athletic Brewing this category was a lager only category. So from day one, we've really blown the lid off what taste and availability can be in this category. Who's typical athletic drinker customer? So when we came into the category, this category was typically a lapsed alcohol drinker. It was very male heavy as the older population generally. And since we've redefined the product and marketing of the category, we've seen that drift younger and younger. Every year. We think 45% of our consumers are below age 45, very heavy in Gen Z. Consumers really, as people have grown up in this digital generation where you have your work in your pocket at all times, everything in your life is filmed and recorded and on record and people still like to drink, but then they like the zebra stripe and working non-alcoholic options with zebra stripping. And I heard that and I forgot it already. Yeah, sorry I jumped right over that. It's basically we and this has been shocking to me. I hear from bartenders all the time that people order alcoholic drinks, not alcoholic alcohol. Oh, okay. I got you. Okay. That's a brilliant idea. You could put food in there, too. That would be a better idea. Curious, how do you do it? You have so many options. And as you say, you're trying out different ones all the time. I mean, are you very non-profitable or how does it work? That costs a lot of money? Well, at the end of the day, in our retail lineup, we're very focused. We have a core group of about five beers, which are very popular and highly awarded. We won 33 Taste awards last year alone and have won about 185 Taste awards. And, you know, there's there's been a plethora of entrants into this category from major brewers to there's been ten celebrity brands with more on the way. And almost none of these companies make their own beer, whereas Levick has gone the other way. We invested 130 million into our own manufacturing, our brewing quality teams, and ultimately, consumers like to know they want to get the best products. I'd like to know what's behind their products. And after that celebrity hype, they've really loved what they found and athletic. And so we really try to stay focused on our retail lineup and bring people the best beers over and over again. I got a. But my investment banker hat back on. How do you capitalize your company? I'm always fascinated to see how these private companies, entrepreneurial companies, how they finance themselves. Yeah, it's such an interesting I like I came from the financial world. It's such an interesting world these days between private and public capital. And we've been so fortunate to have great access to private capital, from angel investors to private equity investors like Alliance Consumer Growth and General Atlantic. And an institutional investor encouraged Dr. Pepper, and that's afforded us the opportunity over the past eight years to invest $130 million into our U.S. manufacturing base. Non-alcoholic brews and taprooms weren't a thing before athletic in the country. We built the first one, and since then we've built them that are 100 times the output of the original brewery on both coasts and in that world. We have found really good access to private to capital in the private markets. But ultimately it is really exciting for us to think about potentially being a public company or running a long term private company. Yeah, I want to ask you more about that. But first, I'd say the marketing is brilliant because you're you know, you're a non-alcoholic brewery, but you're targeting athletes and people who go for hikes and, you know, serious mountaineers and dog lovers and outdoorsy people. I mean, it's just it's amazing. So what is the trajectory that you see before going public? I mean, are you going to open breweries around the country? Are you going to have, you know, bars? Is that is that something that can be profitable not to the bottom line or, you know, is it better to have people just subscribe and sort of have a, you know, beer as a service software? Yeah, Well, in terms of our target customer, we basically built the target customer around my lifestyle because I was authentically living this as a busy professional. I love the outdoors. At 70% of the population considers themself an athlete, even though you'll never find me on any podiums anywhere. I love being out there and participating. And so it was really about that health and wellness trend. And then, yeah, beyond that, our our awareness is still very low. It's about 25% nationally.

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nVenezuela's acting President says she is inviting the U.S. to work with her country after an American operation to capture President Nicolas Maduro. The US swooped into Caracas over the weekend, seizing Maduro and flying him to New York to face drugs and weapons charges. President Trump said the US plans to run Venezuela with elections due eventually. We're going to run everything. We going to run it, fix it. We'll have elections at the right time. The main thing you have to face is a broken country. Well, joining us now is Victor Gao, Vice President at the Center for China and Globalization. Victor was ex Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's English interpreter in the 1980s. Victor, good to have you with us. What's your sense? How does Beijing view the strike that the US made on Venezuela? I think China condemns such an act of aggression and intrusion into a sovereign country and hijacking or abducting a head of state and the first lady. This is purely, in China's view, a violation of the international norms, relations and a violation of the United Nations charter. And if the United States can do this to Venezuela, United States, or any other country, it can do similar things to any other country. And what really drives President Trump and the US government is to seize the oil assets in Venezuela. Now, this is not American assets. This is Venezuela's assets. And for President Trump to pretend that he will run the affairs of Venezuela is very presumptuous in the least and also very much destabilising the international relations. If any country can do this to the oil assets of Venezuela, they can do similar things to Saudi Arabia or to Qatar or to UAE. There will be no peace and stability in the world. So I think China wants to stand on the right side of history. And the United States, apparently, in China's view, is on the wrong side of history. This will not make America great again. This will really be a very dark moment in the U.S. history and in my best judgment, history will look back upon this event as the beginning of the end of Pax Americana, because the United States, through this act of aggression against Venezuela and against the sovereign President of Venezuela, is really starting a new phase in its development. It may eventually lead to the end of Pax Americana. No one in the world wants to be dominated by a neighboring country. Victor. Might China be concerned about its own interests in Venezuela? Because by some calculations, China has lent Venezuela about 100 billion. Of course, China, Venezuela relations are very close and we cooperate with each other fully. And this is all normal contracts. And for the United States to launch such a blatant act of aggression against Venezuela is a matter of great concern to China. And China wants to call for stability. And China wants to continue working relations with Venezuela, especially with the current government. And if there will be a new government eventually in due course, of course, China wants to maintain normal relations with the future government in Venezuela. But all this is no small matter because what the United States is doing is not only negatively impacting all the legitimate business interests of China and Venezuela, it really undermines the international norms. And if this becomes a precedent, I think the United States will strike fear in many other countries in the world. And allow me to mention philosophically, striking fear is not equivalent to gaining respect. Fear is not getting respect. And the United States will be better served if it gains respect rather than striking fear in other countries.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:38:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T07:57:23.056543"}

Georges spoke with Matt Miller and Paul Sweeney on December 31, 2025. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nThe labor market always matters. I mean, it's been a very good labor market for the U.S. for the past at least four or five years. I mean, post-COVID. So people are getting nervous about the labor market, maybe too much. We saw that the latest figures showed that you don't know, you no longer have the destruction of job creation in the private sector, which is a very good thing, because a few months ago we did have the destruction in the private, the labour market and the public market made like the whole most of the job creation during the first the first semester of of the year. So that is a positive sign. We had ECOFIN do not expect the labour market to deteriorate very much in 2026. On the contrary, we think is going to get a little bit better, especially in the second half of the year and that should help the US economy going forward. Karen, You know, we all look here in the US too much probably on the US markets where we have the S & P up 17%, the NASDAQ up 21%. But boy, the returns, the equity returns in European markets are really spectacular, superior to those in most markets relative to the US. Can you give us just a backdrop on the 2025 drivers and whether they'll still be there in 26 for many European markets? Yeah, of course. Well, the main drivers of the European markets are very different from the U.S.. If you look at, for example, in terms of styles, you see value in the in the European markets much better than growth. So like in the U.S., it's the opposite. You see growth and the bodies like this. So in the European markets, it's mainly financials, defense sector, transport, so very, very cyclical markets value segment. So it's mainly value. So it's been tough for growth investors in in Europe because as you spent a few minutes ago, you have winners and losers and most European fund managers are mostly growth like they like in the U.S. So it's been a tough year for active managers in in Europe, but it's mainly financials, defense and transport. And in regards to the difference between Europe and the U.S., for us as European investors, it's even better because since we are, the euro is our main currency. So when you look at U.S. markets in euro, it's only plus 3%. So European markets are much better than the U.S. for European investor. Yeah. And if you look at European markets in dollars, it's astounding the gains that I mean, your CAC, Carol, up 25%. If I were to have invested in dollars at the beginning of the year in Germany, the DAX, I would have gotten a 40% return if I had invested in the beginning of the year, the IBEX 35 in Madrid, 17% return. Better than buying gold. Yes, right. And that's been mainly driven care and by the banks. So it's so funny to me because the years that I spent, you know, I was in living in Germany for six years until 2022, and Deutsche Bank was trading at like 0.3 times. Book How come the European banks have outperformed by so much? It's not like the EU has figured out banking union yet, right? Well, you have three main explanations. The first one is they're mainly domestic. So obviously with the trade war with Donald Trump, investors favored domestic stocks, with interest rates that remained high both in the U.S. and in Europe. Also, people want to go into value stocks. So obviously, financials are value, as you pointed out, even though price to books are now obviously higher than six years ago. So that's also a plus. And the third the third part is the fact that they're, as I said, cyclical. So if you believe in an inflection point for the European economy going forward, to answer Paul's question about 2026, it's also positive for financials because we we expect the economy to be much better than the consensus. The consensus was around 1.1 GDP growth for next year. We could see from 1.4. So it's maybe not so much for U.S. because your your GDP growth is higher, but it relatively is very good for for European markets, if that will be the scenario for next year. So we are still very positive on Europe markets for a 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:38:25 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:02:48.705373"}

Jim Craige, CIO and Head of Emerging Markets at Stone Harbor Investment Partners, said his firm has been investing in Venezuela for the past year. He discussed the potential implications for emerging markets on Bloomberg ETF IQ with Scarlet Fu, Katie Greifeld and Eric Balchunas. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nYou guys have an ETF Vertis. Stone Harbor Emerging Markets High Yield Bond ETF. The Tickers V and Y where you have a 2% allocation to Venezuela. How does the news of the weekend change how you move forward? The news is very significant. So we began adding to Venezuela a little over a year ago and since then it's up a little over 100% and today it's up 30%. So the implications are the defaulted debt that we own in the fund and across our strategies has increased significantly in price, and it should continue to do so. It's trading at $0.35 on the dollar, and the claim value is between one and a half and two times that. So you do a pretty simple restructuring where we expect a lot of value out of this. And, you know, we've seen South America going through a lot of changes. Are you bullish on South America in general, buying more of the debt there? Because I see you have a lot of other countries in your portfolio. What's your take on the whole continent? Most definitely. We're very bullish on Argentina, ten and a half percent yield. We're very bullish in Ecuador, nine and a half percent yield. But more broadly, the region should continue to do very well. EMA broadly should grow two and a half to 3% above the US. I mean, Latin America will be a big part of that. So we're very excited about Latin America. On the flip side of that, I mean, digesting the news from this weekend, obviously you would think this has a lot of implications for em broadly. Are there any regions, are there any countries where you would de-emphasize the debt here? I think oil exporters more generally are probably something We don't want to be overweight right now, and that's because we would expect the supply to increase because of the Venezuela exposure. We're already in an oversupply market right now anyway, so this will not help. So we're not as bullish on oil exporters more generally. You're up that 50% since the fund came out beating EMH. Why? Congrats. What percentage of that is the currency versus the debt itself? It's all the debt. So everything is dollar denominated. Empire has done quite well. But but the dollar denominated debt is also done quite well. But let's say it wasn't like how much currency are you saving then by being in dollars? So you're saving a fair amount in the currency. The currency has a fair amount more volatility and real rates are very high. So I do think there are opportunities in places like Brazil potentially, and Colombia as well. South Africa, you had said that you were buying Venezuelan bonds about a year ago, so you had this inkling that this was a good time to start loading up. And it feels like there's very much asymmetric upside here to the to that debt, especially if there is a restructuring. What is your timeline here for restructuring? I would expect it's going to be 18 months to 24 months. Somewhere in that time frame might be positively surprised. But there's the restructuring, which will be significant for the default, the debt, but also just the amount of investment that's going into Venezuela will be staggering. So high conviction, it sounds like, when it comes to Venezuela, when it comes to what we're seeing unfold here. But that being said, what risks are you monitoring as it pertains to this situation? Well, it definitely could have a a transition that is more disorderly. It's not our base case, but that's certainly a risk that bears watching. So we spent a lot of time talking to political analysts and others in the Treasury and State Department, etc., to try to get a handle on that. But we're very confident that that's not likely. But 45 seconds, I was looking at the return attribution of your fund. The best performing country is Lebanon. Today I learned this. What's going on there? That's so good. Sure. Similar to Venezuela, you have defaulted bonds that are trading in the twenties and your claim values double that. So right off the bat, you've got a lot of upside embedded in the price, but also you've got some transformations there. It is part of the economic team in Lebanon is a good friend of ours and and a former competitor. So a lot of respect for him. But also they just passed a GAP law which allows for some of the bank debt restructurings to be recognized and dealt with. So we're very bullish on law on Lebanon long term.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:21:50 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:33:02.404321"}

Yet no major exchange has agreed to list it, according to Matt Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital. Bloomberg's Isabelle Lee discussed the story on \"Bloomberg ETF IQ\" with Scarlet Fu, Katie Greifeld and Eric Balchunas. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nTell us a little bit about what this ETF, the proposed ticker is graffiti aims to do. So this was filed in June. We wrote it because it was cheeky. It was new. It's like graffiti, grift. And then the ETF name is Government Grip. It's designed to target firms with political ties to Washington. So Matt Tuttle, the CEO of the issuer behind this, said they will scrape speeches, whether it's commentaries or they will look at the companies that members of the Congress disclose basically anything. And it's not specifically tied to any politician or any administration. He just says that I want this to be could translate political influence into investable insights. So that was in June and we were waiting when will it launch? And then so I was asking him and asking him in waiting. And then months after we found out that the exchange wants to list it. So a big no from the three exchanges reportedly. What is the path forward here for Matt Tuttle and for this fund? I think if it's a no, then he there's nothing you can do. So according to him, his only hope is Texas. So it remains to be seen. Texas exchange, which is set to start operating, I think earlier, early this year. But if not that, I asked him, what about Canada, What about others? Are you open to rebranding it and stuff? But he said no, he wants it to be grift for now. He wants it to be bigger. So he doesn't want to change the name of it or the ticker for it. Eric Can an ETF actually launch as an ETF without an exchange behind it? No, not really. I mean, that's the whole point of the name exchange traded fund. So it wouldn't be an ETF at that point to be like a GBTC. Now, Nance, by the way, to me seems equally cynical. This is the Democrat trading ETF and it's got 260 million. So it's interesting if Cruz is the GOP one Nance has the more assets and does better though they've drew a line with grift. I think Texas will list that the people who run the Texas exchange are from CBOE and I think they were the most liberal of the three exchanges. So I have hope there. But if not, you know, this is such a total story. I'm holding out for his alien tech ETF. And you said this is the first ETF you can think of that all the exchanges rejected. I've never heard of this. This is like, you know, like gangster rap back in the day, like Walmart wouldn't carry the album or something. It's like, I've never heard of this, but this feels very on brand with Matt Tuttle, right? Yeah, it's a little bit of a provocateur. Very much so. But it's interesting because last year Katy wrote a story that it's a record year for launches, flows and volume. But now Eric was the one who said it's also it's like the parents are saying no because the ETF industry is like a teenager pushing boundaries using Eric's words.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:47:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:53:40.627063"}

He speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat's the Trump view of the Monroe Doctrine or the Trump iteration of the Monroe Doctrine? What does that look like? Well, as usual, with this administration, we've had very conflicting accounts on precisely what that is. You had Rubio essentially saying other other countries, adversaries, the U.S. need to stay out of the Western hemisphere. He said they are not going to allow a situation where Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world, would be controlled by adversaries such as Russia or China. And then President Trump, when asked about that, basically said, you know, sure, Western Hemisphere and all that. But this is really about an individual country. And everything we hear at this point is essentially in the president's thinking, it was based on a real direct animus he had with Nicolas Maduro. I mean, what you see now essentially is them allowing the vice president, Delsey Rodriguez, to become the acting president. And, you know, she comes essentially from the same group, the Chavistas that Maduro belonged to. So we may see a change in policy from Venezuela under U.S. pressure, but we're not really seeing a major rotation in the in the group of people who are ruling the country, aside from Maduro himself. Right. Big changes need to happen for there to be a different direction for Venezuela going forward. Having said that, Nick, I wanted to ask you, how important is Venezuela to U.S. national security? You know, it's a great question, Carol, because there are a lot of conflicting accounts on that. I mean, if you ask an international law expert, they would say there is no direct threat to the United States from Venezuela. You would essentially need Venezuela to basically be attacking the United States to put forward an argument for self-defense. But, you know, this administration has taken a much more expansive view of U.S. authority, saying that the drug running that they allege was passing through Venezuela was killing thousands and thousands of Americans. And then they also say, you know, the oil issue and the and the influence of U.S. adversaries. So they have argued that Venezuela was cultivating ties with Hezbollah and Iran and China and Russia, and they're not going to allow those adversaries to gain a toehold in the Western atmosphere. And so, therefore, there was a direct threat to the U.S. national security. And, you know, that's really the sort of the foundation on which a lot of the U.S. legal arguments rest in this case for the sort of stepped up aggression against Venezuela. So they're really leaning into that. But, you know, in terms of a direct existential threat to Americans based on what we would conventionally think of as what constitutes the use of force in self-defense, the legal experts argue that it's just not really there. What about when it comes to what's actually happening on the ground in the experience of Venezuelans and to what extent the administration actually has that in mind? I was struck that we didn't hear much of that during the press conference in the past when the U.S. has played a role in ousting leaders. It's talked about the role of democracy and humanitarian challenges and countries and use that as a way to talk about why regime change was important. And now we're getting reporting that from our Bloomberg News team. Venezuela Regroups with New President. Old repression tactics the government has detained. On Monday morning and early afternoon, at least two, at least seven journalists and members of the press. What's the relationship there? Well, no, certainly, I mean, we have not seen the administration put forward the idea of human rights or concerns over democracy as a major reasons reason for this. And, you know, that's evidenced by the fact that aside from Maduro, as I mentioned, they've basically left the rest of the regime in place. And by all accounts, at least from our reporting, it looks like the the regime is is essentially cracking down on any notion of dissent. So we don't really get a sense that that's driving things. On the other hand, the administration has also said, you know, Maduro was an illegitimate president and they cite the election whereby it's widely believed that he got the return to the presidency via illegitimate means. But then that's contradicted on the other side by the fact that President Donald Trump has essentially said, you know, Marina, Maria Conchita Machado's is they don't believe that she can she's strong enough to essentially be the president, even though it was her group, her proxy, who international observers believed essentially won that election. So it's a lot of conflicting talk from the administration and the president and his administration really putting the emphasis on the oil and this drug running idea and the idea that this was strictly a law enforcement operation against Nicolas Maduro himself. The other thing, Nick, that we've been thinking about, you know, why Venezuela, but also and Erik Schatzker brought this up, like why is this happening now? When I think about the last couple of weeks and how much time we spend talking about. The Middle East again. And Israel and Gaza. Certainly Ukraine and Russia. I'm just curious, you know, why this is happening now. You know, again, a question that we have been trying to answer for a long time. We do know that the Trump administration had sought to pressure Nicolas Maduro to leave power in the in the first term. So there was a maximum pressure campaign and a push to recognize then opposition leader Juan Guaido in administration at the official time were saying, you know, Maduro is on his way out. It could be weeks, certainly no more than months. We then had a lull during the Biden administration and this sort of came back to the fore under the second Trump administration, where you have elements of the administration like Marco Rubio, who draws a direct line between Venezuela and Cuba, where he wants to see that regime ushered from power. But then a lot of the reporting we saw, we've also seen in the last several days suggest that there had been a long conversation between the U.S. and elements within Venezuela to push for a negotiated exit for Maduro, based in part and sort of pushed in part by some of these views within the administration. And Trump, for one reason or another, basically ran out of patience. And it felt that an even stronger degree of animus toward Maduro himself and so just decided to go ahead with it. And it was really nothing. No, not any sort of broader or strategic resonance beyond that.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:28:37 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T23:45:13.968035"}

Despite the global headwinds, Matthieu Wiltz said the sentiment is 'positive' for 2026. He spoke exclusively with Bloomberg's Anna Edwards, Tom Mackenzie and Guy Johnson from Paris. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat is the mood, Max, here when it comes to dealmaking prospects in 2026? Thank you, Tom. And thanks online as well for having me this morning. So clearly, the letter, the sentiment is positive and we see the pipeline that we have both in money and in in IPO is very robust. We had a very strong year last year outside of the, let's say, three months post tariff announcement. But since the month of August, we see, you know, the peak of activity and we think that 2026 should be a good year for IPO. Again, there is strong demand from the from the markets. When we listen to clients as well, there is a real willingness to to come to the market and benefit from from from that window. As you said as well. We are in the middle of doing a European tool. So with some of my partner and we are traveling across Europe this week and Middle East next week trying to be with clients on the early part of the show as well and make sure that we stay close to them, We listen to them and we try to help them to navigate into that difficult geopolitical landscape. Markets are doing well, but clearly the geopolitical points are clearly more difficult to anticipate and navigate. But we are bullish. To your question, clearly on our capacity to deliver more IPO this year. Well, Matthew, you bring in the geopolitics. So let's go to that and of course, the unprecedented events in Venezuela. Has that has that changed, changed the view that the teams view, the House view? How are you thinking about that in terms in terms of the impact, the economic impacts, the risk impact, maybe the impacts on deal making as well? Has it adjusted your outlook for 2026 this so. So this one is difficult to assess right now. That just happened. We see that when we look at the market and the performance of the market yesterday, equities did pretty well. We look at the issuance as well because we expect a strong January as well for issuance. Just yesterday in the US, we issued more than 61 billion of bonds, but the markets as a whole and credit spread are doing extremely well. Even if those volumes are impressive, when we look at the at the Brent yesterday, it was relatively stable. We have a target at $58 for the end of 2026. So decrease from where we are at the moment. But clearly that was Venezuela. We have to reassess. We are looking at that. We have our reserve team. We don't expect based on the on the market reaction, I mean, any significant drop now when we analyze the situation, everything will depend of how strong the US will be into the the day to day politics in Venezuela. Because if you look at it, Venezuela is one of the biggest sale. So if you take Venezuela plus the US plus part of Guyana as well, that means that if the US are really driving that, they're going to potentially influence 30% of the of the crude production. So that definitely will have an impact. But it's very early stage and difficult to assess for the moment, but that's something that we monitor every every minute now. Okay. Good morning to you. As you said, the geopolitical situation very much in flux under review as you describe it. Clearly, the fiscal impulse here in Europe, thinking about your your emir geography, the fiscal impulse is certainly an area of focus. And I noticed that you are opening a new digital bank in Germany this year. I wonder what your hopes and dreams are for that fiscal push in Europe and what can it what it can deliver for it for for banks and for J.P. Morgan? So I think that and I'm a European citizen and I've been a gypsy for 25 years, but I've been always in Europe and I'm a strong believer in Europe and the fact that we can do more. When we listen to the Draghi report and we are definitely 100% aligned to what has been affirmed and proposed. We think that with more cooperation, more elements, stronger leader in Europe, Europe can do better. And we live in a world where now economically we have to fight against the US, Asia, part of the Middle East as well. So I think Europe getting together is definitely a must. So and you could think that it's counterintuitive for a US bank to say that because you could think that we would benefit from from more, let's say, fragmentation in Europe. But this is completely wrong. And Jamie Dimon has been very vocal about it as well, having a strong Europe, having more cooperation, having stronger leaders. But that means that in Europe, every country need to accept that they may win in one industry. If we have more M & A and maybe France will have more finance or automaker or healthcare, maybe Germany will do something in Italy or the Netherlands. But we need to make sure that, like authorities and company are allowed to for M & A and cross-border activity. And if we have stronger player in Europe, that's going to be the only way that we are going to be influential, let's say globally against the big player in the other regions. And that's one of the areas where many have been trying to craft some cross-border M & A has been within the banking sector. We heard from a European commissioner recently, Matthew, who was saying that actually it is US banks that managed to navigate the fragmented banking landscape across Europe better than perhaps the the European ones do, because they are partly because they are outsiders. I mean, does that chime with your experience? Do you find as Americans in Europe, it's relatively easy to navigate that fragmented banking landscape? I would not say that. I think that when we talk to clients and I think most of the feedback that we receive from clients is like several of the American banks and Jp morgan being the first one, we've been consistent and we deliver like very strong support and services even during volatile periods. During the global financial crisis, during COVID, we were always there and we never scaled back from our positions. And we have that role across all countries in Europe. The issue that we see in Europe for some of the European players is like it's very hard for them to be strong in every country. Many of them are very strong in their country, but it's very hard to be to have a presence and to be a leader in every countries. And that's why we think that we need more women and we need for Europe to have stronger player and cross country player. So you could see that in a way that would go against our position and maybe against our market share. But we think that having a stronger leader at the end will increase the wallet and will be better for the business overall for Europe. And as JPMorgan in that current environment, we think that we will be alongside some of the strong European banks having having, let's say, most of the market share and do it do a good business in that environment. So that's why we are we are so pushing for more consolidation and more cross-border, I mean, in Europe as a whole. Yep. Matthew, good morning. It's Guy. Couple of questions on the credit market. How much how much of what you guys are going to do this year is going to be datacenter origination in credit is how different does the market in Europe look compared with the United States or Asia? What is the story here in Europe when it comes to that part of that segment of the market? So, I mean, clearly the it's been a big theme last year both in Europe and in the US. But that doesn't the financing we've done a lot. There is truly needs as well also for for CapEx expenditure. That's one place that we like. We want to continue to do business. I know that there is some noise about the fact that we could have a bit of a, let's say, boom at some point in the in the area. That's why we need to be cautious as well. And I think that's the nature of our business, is to be with clients alongside them and give them liquidity when they need to do investments, capital expenditure, but also make sure that we choose the right partner. And I think that based on our experience, because we've been in the credit market for more than 200 years, from private to public, we have that experience. And I think that's the benefit as well. For clients who work with partners like Jp morgan is that we can deliver on the whole range of products. If you want to do private and more private transaction, we've like a very different set of investors. We can deliver on that. If you want to do more public transaction broadly syndicated, we can deliver on that and we have the experience and that's why we are trying to demonstrate because that market is changing with new newcomers as well. So we have to fight to protect capital. Are getting the I'm getting the sense here that maybe you think that some people aren't being careful enough in this space. Clearly, these are not Jp morgan clouds. Of course not. But do you think there are others that maybe aren't being maybe quite as quiet as doing that diligence as well as they should? Maybe. I think it's maybe I mean, for sure. And we see that every day in the market. We are not trying to hide as well. And I think when we published our results a quarter ago, I think Jamie has been very open as well and transparent about the situation we had with tricolor in the US. So I'm not trying to hide and I think issues can happen to everyone. I think that was also a good reminder that for all of us internally that we need to stay highly focused. We need to double check on everything. I think we live in a market today where there is an excess of liquidity to to the market overall. So that's why we need sometimes to refuse to do a transaction if we think that especially covenants are not there and do not give us enough comfort. There is also a big is that more and more co-investing are coming with us or with some of the private equity player. So we were already doing it for us. But having co-investors that put even more pressure on us to make sure that we do the right due diligence and to and that we do invest and lend only where we are 100% comfortable.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:31:08 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T09:42:56.419173"}

Instead of panicking over the Venezuela incursion, traders are focusing on AI growth, potential rate cuts, and a stabilized oil supply. Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights spoke to Bloomberg’s Horizons Middle East and Africa anchor Joumanna Bercetche on the new world order created by President Trump. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nRachel, good to have you with us. And I know we can discuss so many different things from the geopolitical ramifications, the market ramifications of what has gone down at the start of this year. Let me start with the geopolitical question and whether you think this so-called new world order that people are talking about or the dawn role doctrine that President Trump has introduced in Latin America, do you believe that this is going to intimidate or will it actually embolden some of the other authoritarian regimes around the world? Jumana, pleasure to be with you. Happy New Year. It's been quite a busy start to the year for all of us. I think it may embolden other sizeable continental powers like China and Russia in their own spheres of influence, even as they're facing more pressure in the Western hemisphere that the U.S. has indicated is part of its sphere of influence. You know, we continue to have questions of what, you know, how seriously President Trump is taking the end to the conflict in Ukraine and, you know, where China is concerned. They don't want a new trade war, but they're there. You know, maybe there are lots of questions about lessons for Taiwan. Yeah. And I think what was interesting in all of this is at no point at any point in the last couple of days that Trump even mentioned the word democracy. This was not a takeover that was fought on ideological grounds. It was pragmatic. And I think they've been pretty clear and transparent about the need to get access to Venezuela's oil. The announcement overnight that Venezuela is going to send over 50 million barrels to the US. How again, do you think this changes the world's calculus and the relative power nexus in the world that you follow very closely, which is energy and energy supply? Yeah. I mean, in a way, there are two things. One, I'm reminded of the fact that just over a year ago, you and I met and Dubai on this program and we talked about drill, baby, drill. And the place in the world that we're drilling is not up is actually the United States. The domestic supplies are, you know, sort of are stalling. But elsewhere in the hemisphere, this is really increasing in a way. I see this sort of transfer of barrels as both a down payment from Venezuela, but also it's a, you know, and maybe an extorted down payment, but it's also a way to avoid a shut in of production as the US maintains this blockade. Venezuela was running out of storage space because they weren't able to sell the oil to China. When we look at the amount here, this is a sizable amount, but it's, you know, 50 million barrels. That's equivalent to about a fifth of what the U.S. imports every month. It's about two months maybe of Venezuelan exports to China, a little bit less than that. So the big question is also how quickly this comes and whether U.S. business is going to be ready and interested to invest in Venezuela. But overall, we're really seeing a Donald Trump wanting cheaper, you know, cheaper oil and, you know, a might makes. Right. A pragmatic trend, as you say. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you have a brilliant substack, which I enjoy reading very much. And it's called Weaponize the Economy. And I think this is really the manifestation of that weaponizing the economy. And I just wonder, Rachel, whether, you know, you look at the price action in precious metals, industrial metals, the massive run up we've seen in copper and others the last couple of months, do you think that that is an expression of that of some sorts and the fact that there is a global sovereign race to get their hands on these critical minerals and on these critical metals that are so key for the transition and also for for I. Yeah. And copper is linked in to electrification across the board. If anything, even as global oil demand is flattening, demand for power is not. It is going up to the data center demand due to all of the electronics that run our lives. And copper in particular has both a demand story but also has had supply shocks beyond copper. I think what we're really seeing is a push to build out more processing, particularly for critical minerals. And then of course we've got gold and we've got silver, which are much more of a sort of inflation play, I might say, and are really the way that people are trying to play a potentially weaker dollar and to play this these questions of central bank independence and whether the US economy will be run hot going forward. So I do think there's still, you know, probably not going to see as big a run up in gold as we did. And in 2025, it's kind of hard to repeat. But a number of these metals we should continue to see some support for. Yeah. Rachel, always great to have you on and happy New Year to you.

Zinc has given us a lot of talk about the last 12 hours or so after the best best day in over three years. And of course, just in case you missed that, iron ore, as you can see, is also playing, playing a bit of catch up to 50. Futures coming on line on your screens shortly will be the nickel contract in Shanghai. And of course, the separate story in China has been this melt up in yields where the 1.9% handle on a ten year yield very much in focus. We could take that out. That's a three month high on ten year yield and of course, on a 30 year future. We talked about this yesterday hitting the lowest level, 30 year bond futures, specifically the lowest level since 2024. Headline pricing as well. The Bloomberg terminal on the Philippine peso has taken out that recent high on dollar peso. The currency is now trading at a fresh record low against the US dollar. Yeah, so much has changed in last few hours, David. I think we were what we were going to talk about, you know Asia stocks having the best start ever are really for 2026. But really it's been changed to what we've seen here with oil. Now, even that drop that we've seen on that news, a President Trump says Venezuela will send the US as much as 50 million barrels of oil, which would then be sold with the proceeds to benefit both countries. Let's bring in Steven Substance. He joins us now for the details of this. Steve, it it's interesting because, you know, just yesterday we're asking all these questions of who's going to run Venezuela, who's going to be. It seems like the U.S. has signaled that they, in fact, will be directing who pumps the oil and who they sell it to as well. Give us more about these details. Yeah, I mean, certainly. So let's just look at what he said a few moments ago. The president posted on social that they're going to be looking to take 50 million barrels of oil from from Venezuela, as much as 50 million barrels from Venezuela. To put that in the context, Venezuela produces right now about 800,000 barrels a day. And it's unclear exactly where that would come from. Is that stuff that's being produced right now, is that oil that's on the water? He said it sanctioned oil. So maybe this is this is oil that's already in tankers, but we have a few analysts and experts kind of scratching their head on exactly what that means. But clearly, the signal is Trump wants to put the US flag in on oil assets in Venezuela. There are also reports from other news agencies that he wants the country to sever ties with with China, with Cuba. China is a major investor as well in oil and in Venezuela. At the same time, The Wall Street Journal was reporting that the president will be having meetings with officials from Exxon, Chevron and other US oil producers about investing in Venezuela. So clearly it is a full court press with the Biden with the Trump administration in terms of getting some some American more of American presence there. You have to note that Chevron has been there for decades. They're still there. They produce by 25% of the oil that's exported from Venezuela that's not sanctioned. Can expand that. That's that's a big question that we're going to be looking at. Absolutely. It it seems markets are moving along two dimensions, right to your point. One is headline risk. And we're not really sure where and when and how the oil actually shows up in the market. But to the latter point, you just made their statement on just how much CapEx and where the conversations are with oil majors, US oil majors, specifically in terms of how they can get involved in getting the oil out of Venezuela, Where is that conversation now? You know, I think when we first saw the the the actions over the weekend of of Trump and the administration taking auto and and kind of saying that they're going to essentially be running the country and they're going to be paying for it with with Venezuelan oil. When Bloomberg reporters in the US were reaching out to their sources and what's been reported in our stories, they were bit caught off guard. There have been no agreements to expand production there. That being said, they are studying it and we have trading houses as well, you know, studying it. We've reported that. I think the discussions are early. I think a lot of it's going to go down to as well. What is the Trump administration going to offer? What kind of guarantees, what kind of cash are they going to get? Because with Brent, look at this, we got Brent coming down to $50 right now. You know, when when you're at that level, does it make sense to be investing in oil production in a country where costs are pretty high? You're going to need to invest a lot, $10 billion a year for ten years to boost production to where it used to be in the early 2000, according to some analysts. And then on top of it, you look at other places in the world, you've got other shale assets that are maybe more attractive. You have to deal with the geopolitical risk, maybe the CapEx, you have to spend quite as much. So you're going to the Trump administration is really going to have to convince the Chevron's and the Exxon's to get into Venezuela. I don't think they're exactly rushing in right now. That's not the sense that that we're reporting. Yeah. Steven, based on that report about Trump possibly wanting Verizon to sever ties with the likes of China, given that they are the biggest importer of Venezuelan oil, what do you think the response is going to be? I mean, from from the beginning, the Chinese. You know, China has been saying that that this was unfortunate, that the US acted illegally, unilaterally in a way that doesn't fit international laws. So the China will likely continue to hit back, at least in terms of of their statements. But let's take a step back. Venezuela produces about 1%, less than 1% of global oil supply. And China, while they were buying quite a bit on shadow fleet vessels that had been sanctioned, that's only about 4% of China's oil supply. And China is able to look elsewhere. We're entering a year of an oil glut and there's plenty of oil. The market is awash with crude. And so Chinese tea pot, smaller refiners can find alternative supplies. So do the Chinese even really want to be buying when they're such a large presence? And there's a geopolitical risk and the Trump administration is making everything so unpredictable. Why buy these barrels that could be boarded by by US military or U.S. Coast Guard? Why? Why do that when in fact you can just buy from someone else where you don't have that geopolitical risk? So will Venezuela be cutting ties with China or will it be the other way around? Well, China, just when they look at everybody in the playing field, maybe they'll just go somewhere else. Fantastic. Steve INSKEEP, thank you so much, Steve INSKEEP Shinseki there. He leads our Asia energy coverage to our other big stories. The geopolitics also playing out across these markets is what's taking place between China and Japan here. So Japan has made a formal protest over China's move to ban exports of items that could have military uses. It is the latest flare up in diplomatic tensions between the major Asian economies over the comments from the Japanese prime minister last year on Taiwan. Let's bring in Tim Miller, a China correspondent here with us on set to help us understand what the Japanese response has been. Well, Japan is obviously opposed to this is it has asked China to withdraw those measures. What China does next will be something to watch about the export control measures is pretty sweeping. It includes over 800 items from chemicals to equipment that are used in aviation and shipping. And so, you know, it could potentially have far reaching consequences because the language is pretty vague. It says it's targeted at Japan's military, but also any other end uses that help to boost Japan's military. So a lot is going to depend on how China interprets this and whether it applies it strictly or liberally. And it could potentially impact everything from automakers to equipment manufacturers. But in terms of size and scope, you compare this to 2010 when China also placed a limit on the exports of the scope. This time is more narrow because the last time they haven't, they had limited it to just the military uses. What could happen next. Is there a risk that there would be retaliation from Japan? Yes. Well, you you think about you know, it really depends on whether the two sides come to the table, because we know China wants Japan's prime minister to retract those comments and she hasn't done so. But in terms of what Japan can do in its military, in its toolbox, we know the two countries are very closely intertwined because Japan is China's second largest export destination. It is also its third largest source of imports. It sells a lot of machinery equipments to China. And where Japan really dominates is in the semiconductor industry. If Japan places its own export controls, that it could cripple China's chips ambitions. And then you also got to think about the wildcard, which is whether or not President Trump will respond to this, because Japan and the US are very close allies is the US also joins the fray that could tilt the power balance towards Japan. All right. Thank you so much. Below there on the latest on the two stories playing out quite, quite clearly across assets this this, this Wednesday. Right. We're about 90 minutes to the opening bell. We'll see what how that plays out, of course, across Chinese markets ahead of that. That will be live. And we're back in Vegas at six with TDK CEO. And what a sight to. We'll explain why they're betting big on this next wave of physical air. I pictures right now out of Vegas where currently. Okay. Well currently things are buffering. That's one step that we should be seeing. Of course, the the the noble boss there. We'll bring that to you a bit later on. And also, we'll be hearing, of course, from the CTO, Lenovo, CTO, about their business outlook. Much more ahead. Suffice to say, this is the China show. Good morning. Let's talk about TDK. That's the Apple battery supplier in Tokyo. It's it's moving into smart glasses. It's putting it in direct competition with a lot of Chinese rivals. Also in the space, this race to produce the lightest wearables. On our co-anchor of course, is live for us at CES in Vegas with someone perhaps, who can maybe maybe tell us more Sherri. Yeah. You could just see your proposal as more yes to the case. You'll notice how it is here with us to talk us through all of their latest innovations and of course, what to expect when it comes to 2026. Thank you so much for joining us today. Yahtzee. Happy New Year to you. Happy New Year to you, too. And really, when it comes to tDCS is very interesting because we've always linked you to cassette tapes, but now your branding is being in everything in electronics parts, but also making things better. Tell us a little bit about that tagline and how that really reflects what you do. Yeah, actually, as a part of our long term vision to get transformation, that we have also made kind of transform formation from branding. Right? And you know, we already stopped manufacturing the tapes more than ten years ago. But instead of that, we have become a completely B2B company being inside. Right. And, you know, we are committed, you know, to be inside and be better forever basically will never come. Because the thing is that customers don't necessarily see it from the outside, but you have all of these sensors, microphones, power storage and of course, these air smartglasses. Now that you're partnering with, tell us a little bit more about that. Oh, thank you for pointing out this one and in your pocket. I have to ask you, actually, you know, this CSC is not our theme is a ecosystem ecosystem. And the message we are delivering is that, you know, tech is an enabler and the TDK is committed to shape A from leading because that's interesting. You're not necessarily manufacturing the smart glasses, but being inside these in Ableton. Yeah. And today we actually made a press release called The Eyesight Eyesight. This is a kind of a core solution for next generation of, you know, smart glass and also human centric. The device that you know, I intent I intent. Right. Right. Yeah. Plus our cutting edge sensor technology component technology we are able to provide such kind of the, you know, solution to this application, the technology coming from soft eye, which you acquired last year, do you have any more plans for M & A this year? At this moment, no concrete plan. We are now making out, you know, uniting that the software resources like custom chip and also like a coming up and a software together with other, you know, components, sensors, etc., etc., making us a kind of a solution towards this, you know, smart glass, high density energy is very important. And being able to fit everything in a very tiny little equipment. Right. Which is what you do, especially with your anode silicon and the battery technology. Right. Your work on your fourth generation right now, When can we expect those and you're working on your fifth generation as well? Right, exactly. Actually, last year we would actually yeah, we released Generation three, which have kind of 50% higher energy density compared to the identical like. But as we said this year, you know, middle of next fiscal term, you know indeed we are planning to needs gen four and of course next generation we are in R & D, research and development to see what will five a fifth generation look like. What are the tweaks and changes. Yeah, actually, you know, fourth generation of course, higher energy density and the fifth of course higher, as I've been telling you, better and better and better. That's what I can tell you. Now. We have seen, of course, the challenges broadly in the tech industry as well as a hike in prices. I was speaking to Samsung's president and CMO recently and he was talking about how they're raising prices as we speak because of the shortages of memory chips. Now, that doesn't necessarily hit you directly, but at the same time, what's your demand outlook from your customers? Yeah, I'm actually aware of this kind of information. And you know, toward the next fiscal time being this year, April, we keep carefully even investigating, checking the actual demand. But what I want to emphasize is that they don't we control the controllable means, as I told you, that the higher energy density, you know, high end, the kind of batteries we keep promoting, that what we can do quite well, you know, nearby, regardless of the, you know, of demand, you know, fluctuation, uncontrollable also of the strength of the Japanese yen. How does ¥1 change affect your business? Yeah, actually one in powder is one to make a change like $2 billion in terms of operating profit. So yeah, also you know although it's controllable we carefully keep monitoring and watching cheaper Japanese yen helps you. In general. In general. In general, especially because you operate in so many different markets. China being your biggest one. Yes. Which one are your bright spots for 2026? Oh, actually, I want to see on a broader basis. Of course, China remains one of the most important, you know, you know, regional area. But of course, here U.S. what Europe I want not see that you know, the market potential on a global basis as an enabler for the future. As the optimist that you are, you always use very positive words like dynamic when you describe the U.S. market. What do you expect to see this year in 2026, especially for your business here in America? Oh, I have to repeat, it's going to be dynamic. I try to always say, you know, positivity. Right. And, you know, external circumstances, you know, remains dynamic. But as I told you, this ecosystem, Right. Is going to grow regardless of any of the challenges, including tariffs, I believe. So depending on, you know, how much, you know, growth, you know, this ecosystem is going to make. But to this degree, it's sort of direct you to I think you'll be you know, I'm joined the by. SCIUTTO Really always good to talk to you. And what a pleasure to catch up with you here at CBS Las Vegas. Thank you so much for joining us. Please come to our both to read more. Yes, I will join you both very soon. CEO of TDK, here with me at CES 2026, Yvonne. They are such a dynamic interview. I love it. All right. Sorry you got to try on those glasses coming up as well. I want to see you in that Instagram. Thanks. Of course, to our team and the as in Las Vegas, of course, we're still waiting. I think I'm the Lenovo CEO is actually making that keynote speech as we speak right now on the stage there. We'll bring you some live pictures once we do have them. But here we go, pre-market looking like this here right now. But a retreat when it comes to Hong Kong, we're down about 4/10 of 1%. This is Bloomberg. All right. We're taking a look at some of your agenda today in terms of resources and like maybe some overbought signals that we're seeing across some of these Chinese markets. So maybe that perhaps that's why we are seeing a little bit of retreat and the free market in Hong Kong today, mainland turnover, certainly one thing to watch as well. We are still around close to 2% levels there, a 1.9% level on the ten year yield in China. Obviously, the China Japan tensions that seem to have added a bit more attention now just given what we saw with some of these export sort of bans. So certainly that's weighed on the Japan market. We'll see what we see in terms of rare earths and autos, which already started to fall in Japan as well. There is a soon to be sale here today of one year bonds. Our studies of data of foreign reserves and we're focusing on copper nickel producers, where we saw nickel seems to be stealing the spotlight from some of these precious metals of light, also copper as well. But take a look at what it comes to the pre market day. What do you see? Yeah, so we're very close to that level. You mentioned here on 1.9% on the ten year yield and the nickel the nickel contract in Shanghai, as you can see, is playing a massive catch up. And I think what's interesting to us and our story actually does this a really good amount of justice is, you know, the role, the major role that Asian traders, Chinese traders specifically are playing in the nickel store. Right. Substantial volumes coming through during Asian hours. And when the overnight session in Shanghai then kicks off, then you see that pick up once again. That's just to say this is one area of the market we're tracking. In fact, there's one specific stock in the pre-market already feeling the tailwinds. That's Xinjiang, Shin Shin, That's a that's a nickel specifically that has a nickel play there. As you can see, 7% in the premarket that's listed here in Hong Kong, Jiangxi Copper, because it's a broader base metals play that make up 1%. The next two slides you're going to see is more on the EV sector live. So shout me Lei Jun is talking about releasing this new as you seven vehicle model in April, unchanged for the moment for the stock. We're also watching Seattle Eneos. So the two I've announced two cooperating on long life batteries swap network. So far you've seen NIO down 2% here as well. But yeah, you're watching the China show. We'll bring you the latest as as as well. That open is also coming up next. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back. You're watching the China show. So we're looking at some weakness in the opening going here in Hong Kong. Might see the opposite. We'll see what happens, of course, with the session. Here's a big number for you. Literally 2.8 trillion. That was the renminbi. That was the turn over in the onshore markets yesterday. Just underscores the revival in that market on price and also in activity. Yeah, so we'll see. I mean, the rest of Asia is to give it a breather today. Add the oil story, given what we heard from President Trump on Venezuela, how they want the country to at least sever ties with the likes of China, Iran and Russia supposedly has sent oil prices lower here this morning. You also have that China Japan spat that has escalated just given these new export curbs when it comes to Japan with any military use. So that certainly could squeeze supplies or rare earths and other materials here. What you're seeing in the onshore market is still some green on the screens. We're up about a 10th of 1% for the CSI 300. But as David mentioned, we're very close to the 1.9%. However, the Chinese ten year yield. So we'll see. It has been rotation out of bonds into stocks of late right now. Might not translate as that closely, but we'll see. Right now, we are seeing when it comes to onshore markets, a mixed picture here across the tech space as well. But you are seeing the likes of camera coming down about 8/10 of 1%. There is a one year bond sale coming out of China today. Goldman Sachs, a pretty interesting line, basically saying, you know, expect a slow bull run or slow or bull run for Chinese stocks in 2026. They're still seeing upside, though, of 20% for MSCI China and 12% for the CSI 300 this year, driven almost entirely, they say, by earnings growth of the pause and talk about Hong Kong market and the open there so far. But they basically said when it comes to southbound flows southbound, that buying to reach $200 billion, making another record highs. What their forecasts are when it comes to flows from the mainland. So right now, Hong Kong, though, is taking a back seat. We're seeing tech on offer. They're down by 9/10 of 1%. Most of the more pronounced moves, well, seems to be Alibaba. Baidu were down close to 2% or so. So, yeah, we're maybe we're taking a bit of a pause button here when it comes to this tech rally as well. They did mention when it comes to some of these RSI, as we are looking at pretty overbought territory, things were making a bit more heated there after we did see, of course, Asia Stock's best start ever this year with Taiwan. Korea really hitting records just yesterday. So all of that taking a bit of a back seat here today. We're watching oil stocks in particular. Given the drop in oil prices that we saw after we heard that truce, social posts from President Trump, about up to 50 million barrels that they're going to get from Venezuela, certainly is going to be one thing to watch for the markets. The Shanghai crude is catching down as well. We're down two and a half percent. A mixed picture across, of course, some of these oil majors here. But certainly going to be a key question about what this means for China, which is what is the biggest oil importer of Venezuela. Right. By disruptions, he told us, you know, the oversupply everywhere around the world, perhaps there are alternatives for China to source out their crude. If you take a look when it comes to, you know, the metals space and what we're seeing, commodities, it continues to be a heated story. Right. And this time around we're talking about nickel futures. So we've gone from aluminum yesterday. Gold. Silver obviously has been on a tear. Copper as well. A nickel is the one to watch here. We are seeing futures up some 7% on the mainland is seen, John. CMC, as we say, is up some 5% and really reacting to that and the rare earths stocks as well as China doing quite well, just given, of course, the flare up and tensions that we've seen between China and Japan. Just two things to note. Okay, So the geopolitical news flow is quite heavy right now. So let me get started with this. There's an reports, if you recall about one or two weeks back, there was that there was a deal that was announced last week. To be more specific here I met a 2 billion US dollar a purchase, if you remember madness, of course, that's the artificial intelligence platform, the relocated, of course, the staff and tech to Singapore. We now understand that met well China is now reviewing that purchase. That's what we know so far based on this report coming out of the F.T.. Separately. It is separately completely different story completely separate set of of of of themes. Here you have quite a show which is the peer of tik-tok is weighing raising money. This is a Bloomberg scoop here weighing raising money in the offer bond markets for the for the very first time shares are down 1.3%. We'll bring you more details once we have more information on that. Right. We'll leave the breaking news there for now. And we'll take you straight back to Vegas, where high tech, the world's largest LiDAR sensor maker, is standing by with our tech correspondent, Bill Bell. Thanks, Dave. I was just speaking with David Lee about this co-founder and CEO of Personal Technology, about the analogy you might want to use in this situation. And I just thought your new term, which is hard launch, and that's exactly what you've done with Nvidia because it seems like you guys have actually been working on this for quite a while. Yeah, exactly. So the news came out yesterday about it. And the idea to me is like we use the analogy, it's almost like I've been secretly dating a supermodel for a long time. Even when I tell people like a No, I don't believe you. Right. Of course, the news is official now. People know that we're officially on the new Hyperion platform, which is extremely exciting, definitely for us and I think has also great for the OEM customers who are interested in taking a various solution. Here's the reason why. It's very, very important. Used to be that one OEM to think about an autonomous driving product. You top that in two sections of the software, the hardware, the data and the training and everything. Right? And then you think magically they will be put together and it will work? Well, it turns out it's a little more complex than that. So now India has this entire platform who has all the proven already working with the with vendors like us and the suppliers. It's ecosystem. So now the OEMs will know when they pick the solution. They don't have to redo the hardware, they don't have to retrain the model because the data is there. So it's making this extremely simple and streamlined and also low risk because it's proven we saw that share price move off the back. But can you just quantify it for us? What's the actual size of this opportunity for you? What does it actually mean in financial terms? We actually don't know how big this could be, but I'll give you some numbers to justify that. First of all, China China market is anywhere between 25 to 28 million cars, but the global is more than 80 million. So that's a factor of roughly three. And also on the product side, the global OEMs tend to think more higher end, more advanced, higher quality parts. And that also give you an extra benefit of being able to work with customers globally. If you multiplied them, it's actually a much, much bigger market than China alone. That's why people are more excited about it. Obviously, we're in Las Vegas and it's a huge automotive market in North America as well. But how do you think about the opportunity here, particularly, Of course, you guys have faced tensions with Washington as well? Definitely. Definitely. Well, there isn't a perfect solution to fully solve that problem. But here's what we have done, right. The first of all, we publicly announced also at Bloomberg that we are in the process of building a factory at Thailand and which will be in production early 2027. And that is going to be our new manufacturing facility to support the demand from the global OEM side. At the same time, we're also building advanced products for those platforms that the global humans required because they are doing long range, high definition level three applications which were also super excited about. And also in the meantime, of course, it's a necessary step for us to make sure that we're fully compliant with all the regulatory efforts, including on the hardware side, on the data side, and also on the software side for the software. Most people think lighter has software, but actually by the regulatory definition we have firmware, which is a software you used to control the device, but there's no data, no way in it to make sure it's compliant everywhere. So the China manufacturing for China and Thailand for global For global China. Yeah. Okay. And what's the breakdown then to anticipate? What are you actually expecting to get out of that Thailand factory today? As I said, it's still mostly China because the Thailand is not ready yet. And also, quite honestly, China has been leading the global market on the volume and also on the product side. But in the end, we do expect a more balanced mix between China and Europe and the US and a lot of the third World countries. You are the world's biggest light maker and and your market presence is felt. I know, for instance, robo sense is another one of your peers in China. They actually have to pivot some of their business away to try and capture new markets, just given the heft of cyber. But what about in the US market because Luminar is another company that recently actually declared bankruptcy. So who do you see as your competitors and what are the pressures that you see on that front as well? The competition is always going to be there because Lighter is a super important product and the market is massive. I think some people have jokingly say our biggest competition is from the people who don't want to use lighters. I feel like that's more important for us to make sure we convince those people. And today we want to do that via data. Right. And Karzai has shipped more than 2 million units and from the past few years, and most of them are saving lives like we already have public statement from the CEO of some of our custom. Are saying that in critical cases, fatal accidents by could save up to 90%. So we want people to look at the data. That's one thing, safety. The other thing is we want to people look at how far we have gone in reducing the price, because in the end it's a return and it's an investment. As you remember from five, eight years ago, that was $50,000 per liter. Now it's below $200. We feel like we've done a great service to the industry by making this reliable, effective lifesaving sensor affordable. Now that you get to that price point, you also open up new opportunities and new markets because you're not talking about a car that say 50, 60, 70,000 U.S. dollars. You're talking about maybe humanoid robot that's far cheaper. So what are the opportunities you see outside the EV space? That's great. First of all, there isn't really a a case where if you fail in automotive, you can pivot to be successful in other markets. Here's why. In the end, they leverage the same capability. It's a manufacturing, it's a vertical integration, it's a globalization. It's the ability to control the costs. They actually are the same. So for us, we're lucky that we build the strong capability from automotive and especially China automotive, which is super competitive. And then we leverage that to products outside automotive, where all are humanoid for sure. But I don't know about being cheaper for those products. And we are on the all the robotaxis for sure. And also where are all different crazy applications? One of them is lawnmowers, which is actually affordable, is like €800 or so. Right now you can buy a €800 autonomous lawnmowers in Europe with our scissor on it. So you don't have to bury the wire, You don't have to do all the the crazy things and it will just move along very, very quickly. So those are some of the applications we're looking at. But in the end, we're not tailoring a product for the market. We use the standardized technology and product and we cater to parts of different robotics applications where we feel like we can empower all of them. And the value and the margin of that business will eventually be bigger than cars. All right. Autonomous lawnmowers. I'm going to have to try and check those out here at see us. David, it's always a pleasure to speak with you. Von That was David Lee, the co-founder and CEO of Host AI Technology. Yeah. Autonomous lawnmowers. We heard about the Chinese company that does what we call vacuum cleaners as well. Yeah. So some of that stuff, the gadgets, they're now well, you can't fake it's not me leaving, by the way things that they really proposed as well. Yeah well the team also there has been talking to Lenovo right. They've been unveiling new AI products and partnerships at its annual tech World conference in Las Vegas. The CTO told Bloomberg the company is focusing on providing hybrid A.I. technology for its customers and if these opportunities and embedding the technology into robotics. Think about a future. We don't believe the future belongs to any particular device, a single device, a single model, a single agent, if you will, data the same way it's highly distributed in nature, where the data sits. When we say hybrid, I we we believe in a future where it is an ecosystem of those models, ecosystem of those devices and ecosystem of those agents that all needs to harmoniously, I think, work with one another, if you will. And we we basically want to enable that. And part of that is what we call the public eye, the general purpose models on the cloud. Part of it is private. They either personal or enterprise that may sit at the edge, you know, or and use end user devices. There's that need I guess to have on device processing and then also cloud based air solutions. So how does that actually work in practice and how is it technologically feasible as well? Ultimately, we see cloud, cloud and edge and Edge and Device II coexist. Of course, that's the foundation of the hybrid architecture overall. And so we want to be ambient, always available, sit there and in anticipation of the users intent, the users need, if you will, and really understand the context. And if you put all of those things together, remembering interactions with you, memory management and things like that, we can essentially help create the best personalized experience that that you can have part of the event as well. Lenovo has been unveiling a new range of of Motorola products. But but which ones stand out to you in particular? We're excited about the entire product line line up from the IPCC tablets as well as our new Motorola line. The most exciting part to me is the camera integration, the intelligent ambient air integration, and how does it actually work in progress at that ambient air? What does it look like from a user experience? It it think of it as a as a very user centric, simple and single interface. So whether you want to access that through your phone, through your tablet or through your PC, you're essentially interfacing with the same user interface and it has the capability to operate across platforms as well as integrate data about you through what we call a personalized knowledge base. Part of your role is heading up the emerging technology group for Lenovo. So so which ones are you focusing on in most detail? I is of course, needless to say, it's our main focus to enable our hybrid vision both for personal AI as well as for enterprise AI. But beyond that, I'm leading up research groups in robotics, so physical and embedded AI is a focus area for us. Cybersecurity, of course, is a foundational technology for almost everything that we do. That's another area. Next generation computing technologies. Is there anything that we really haven't considered yet that you think could be on the horizon? Yes, of course. I think agent in what we call agent native devices at Lenovo is an area that is active research and rapid policy and prototype development for us as well. So I anticipate two things. One, I think the interactions and interaction modalities will change as we go from traditional traditional devices and traditional interaction modalities to new form factors, maybe more voice based, gesture based, eye gazing based, whatever that is. Right. But at the same time, I think different companies are experimenting with different device categories in terms of being able to disclose to the user as possible. It's a I think this notion of sensing is going to be very important in the future to be able to really understand deeply the user and not in sort of an interrupted way, if you will. So the AI needs to be there 24 seven. That was the Lenovo's CTO, Tolga Cotillard, there with our colleague and co-anchor, of course, Annabel there in in Vegas. Now, if you are a subscriber of Bloomberg, you can we watched that specific interview that fell to stared or others. The many others, of course, that are colleagues have done it for us. Special coverage there at CBS in Vegas. TV goes the function you run be part of conversations and instant messages on the shows. Any suggestions and commentary on our coverage and if you want any specific questions, in fact, to our guests coming up here and shows, please feel free, of course, to drop them. You have our permission to slip into our DMS. This is the China show. Lydia and Siemens are expanding their partnership, using AI to transform industrial systems, and they plan to launch the first fully AI driven manufacturing sites this year. In video, CEO Jensen Huang and Siemens AG CEO Roland Bush spoke with Bloomberg about the collab. We're announcing a big partnership between us. We've known each other for a long time, but the partnership we're announcing is really a big deal. One, we're accelerating their EDA software. We're accelerating their simulation software. We're integrating A.I. technology, physical A.I. and a genetic A.I. into their teams center and their factory automation operating system. And so we're working together across this entire spectrum. When we accelerate the software, then we'll get to use it to design our chips and systems. When we accelerate their simulation software, we'll use it in our factories to simulate the thermal properties of our factories. When we integrate our automation and agent systems into their AI industrial operating system, we can then use it in our factory floors with our partners, for example, Foxconn. And so we're working across this entire spectrum together, and we're going to put the technology to use and basically as soon as we can. What's the net effect for agents and is it improves margins, efficient capital allocation? I know that might sound a bit dry, but actually right now that's the answer everyone is searching for. How is this investment in AI and use of the technology actually change things in the real world for me? Well, you announced yesterday Vera Rubin. It takes six different chips to integrate into this incredible system called Vera Rubin. And when you're done, each one of these Vera Rubin GPUs is 240,000 watts and it is ten times more energy efficient than the last generation. It is ten times more cost efficient than the last generation. But it's still the technology is insanely complicated. 115,000 engineering years came together to build this system. And so when we accelerate EDA tools, we accelerate simulation tools. And when we can eventually and I'm hoping very soon, design entire Vera Rubin systems inside a Siemens digital twin, the chance, the ability for us to create much, much more complex systems and we'll scale, we'll do it much more efficiently. And so this is really about being able to do the impossible and be able to do it impossible, the impossible right the first time. And once we we then realize that I could see real world impact. This is where it really deploys the full power and also the economic power. And it's not only in the datacenters or many factories, which we see, but also on the edge, because once you start inferencing with low latency, you bring this technology to the edge. This is a huge potential for our customers to to deploy this technology. And this includes, of course, includes hardware and where we come from, from the chips, it goes into the controllers. Some of our controllers run on chip use. Yes. And then it goes all the way to the industrial PC. Exactly. Yeah. And the envy. Now, these are these are A.I. and don't exactly supercharge it. And they can now run algorithms trained in the cloud. They can run it on the shop floor and do all that tricks. What? We talked about it in the lead time optimization and running in a planned. And that makes a huge difference. Siemens president and CEO Roland Busch there and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking exclusively with our colleague Ed Ludlow on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. Well, much more from of course, that's coming up. This is Bloomberg. All right. We're starting things off with a look at this metals rally. And the iteration today is really in the actual steel stuff and the stuff that goes into the steel stuff. We're talking about iron ore. Yeah. If you're just wondering, 100, we're closed. 110 now on the Singapore contract and how that's playing out across some of the things like steel rebar, of course, in in Shanghai. That's also playing out there. We go in the equity space from everything from silver to nickel producers. Plenty more ahead. This is the China shop. Welcome back to the second hour of the China show. Here's a look at the HCI part of the session and following the rest of the region here after what has been a record run in Asian stocks for the first week of this year, we're taking a bit of a pause or here a breather. I should pause or that's not a word. Pause button, at least when I know I don't hosers, though. Hosers. Yeah, but we're not going to get into that now. It's cold outside. Okay. The sun. But yes, it is frigid, to say the least here. So certainly I'm taking my UGG boots out, my puffy jackets. I think we were talking about fleece and suede bedsheets and our team here today. But yes, things are looking a bit cold. It's cold sentiment here as well, Dave. I mean, you add it's mostly geopolitical, right? We take a look at what happened with the oil price and what President Trump has said about, you know, taking up to 50 million barrels from Venezuela and also when it comes to China and Japan, too. Yeah, it's still unclear, though, as Steve Stapp was pointing out earlier, how and where they're going to get that, because they I think the daily output is about 850 anyway. Less than 1 million. $1,000,000. Well, we'll get the math correctly on that. But yeah, it's the temperature has cooled certainly across these these markets. Taiwan is down about 8/10 of 1%. Korea, though, is that still the Samsung story? And I think we'll we'll talk more about that. The Macquarie came out and upgraded their price target on Samsung to currently the street high of about 90% above the current level. So that gives you an indication, of course, that a runway Jakarta is coming online. The reason we're looking at that is you'll find out very shortly with the nickel rally, it's still front and center here is showing up in London, of course, in Shanghai, iron ore is also trading at about 110. So that's certainly something that's playing out across Southeast Asia in markets like the Philippines and also Indonesia. Oil, we talked about that, Brent West, Texas and Shanghai crude coming up on your screens. And we are close. We have been flirting with 62. The downside there haven't quite yet seen a clear break of that level. Perhaps that's in the immediate future. But for now, we're trading just above that on the most active contract on Brent. Yeah, let's stay on that as well. With President Trump saying that Venezuela will send the US as much as 50 million barrels of oil, which would then be sold with the proceeds to benefit both countries. Let's bring in Jill de Souza, managing editor, to talk us through how this is all going to work. Well, you're right. I think we don't necessarily know exactly how it's going to work just yet, But as you and David were just talking, this kind of figure would represent about 30 to 50 days worth of oil production. I mean, Venezuela was producing about a million barrels of oil per day. That was before the Trump blockade. Right. And again, we're talking levels that are much, much lower than historic levels. Of course, Venezuela still does sit on the world's highest proven oil reserves. But like even then, you know, we've talked to analysts who say that that may run out within a matter of a few weeks or so. So I think it's still unclear as to what exactly this represents in terms of how, you know, how the US ultimately ships this. But it is I think, you know, many of the analysts we've spoken to talking about how this is a much bigger number politically maybe than it is economically, at least at this moment. But obviously it does just show you just how unprecedented this entire situation is and also just how determined Trump is to continue to remain really, really closely intertwined with whatever Venezuela looks like as a country going forward. And it has come with very specific conditions. I think it was ABC that was reporting that they're part of the final plan would be to ask Venezuela to cut their ties with the likes of Russia and China. What do we know about that? Yes, David, so this is a really interesting one. ABC citing people familiar, saying, first of all, that Venezuela would have to exclusively partner with the United States on oil, so essentially be like their exclusive supplier effectively in terms of what this means for that quad in its relationships, it's not entirely clear what it would mean to dramatically reduce relationships with China, with Iran and so forth, but obviously that would represent a massive political realignment for Venezuela, given how much work they ultimately do with those countries. But again, just have to keep going back to the point that Trump is really, really, you know, is really intent adamant about getting involved in Venezuela. Of course, what that ultimately means, particularly when, you know, he's left, you know, Maduro's VP, now acting president, Rodriguez in charge. You know, there still is not, you know, that desire to completely oust the rest of the Doors regime, including many loyalists there. What this looks like without, you know, U.S. troops on the ground or anything like that, I think still leaves a lot of open questions here. Jill, thank you. Jill teases there from one specific front to another. And we're looking at China, Japan, the big announcement from the Chinese yesterday, the response from the Japanese shortly after it's playing out across markets. You look at Japanese autos, you look at Chinese rare earth stocks, for example. So here we got going into the last 25 minutes in a morning session and we're looking at declines across some of the big names there. Have a look at rare earth stocks also coming up on your screen. STU Yeah. So these are the ones, of course, in China, you are seeing them, most of them rallying today on the back of this, right? There was this sort of China daily report saying that the Chinese were studying tightening rare earth exports to Japan as a possible sort of sign of escalation there in despair. Chinese media also reporting, you know, certainly that to this morning. So the latest flare up in these diplomatic tensions between the two economies. Let's bring in China outside, of course, my mom in law, who, you know, obviously has been tracking all of this, as Japan has as China, to withdraw the measures. Tell us more about the impact of these export controls. Yes. So the Chinese Commerce Ministry has issued a statement saying that starting immediately, they're going to start banning dual use items meant for Japan's military. And it's a very extensive list of over 800 items ranging from chemicals to electronics to, you know, technology used in aviation and shipping. The scope is is targeted at military, but the language is a little bit vague and perhaps intentionally so, because it says it applies to any end uses that contributes to boosting Japanese military. So there's a lot of room for the Chinese government to interpret this. They could apply it to civilian companies with even the most indirect links to the military and potentially could have far reaching consequences are everything from automakers to precision instrument manufacturers and equipment makers. If you compare it to 2010, though, when China and Japan had a conflict over the Senkaku Islands, the scope here is more limited because in 2010 they had banned the export of rare earths without sort of limiting it to military uses. Our economists at Bloomberg Economics have chimed in on this amendment. A potential spiral of retaliation could ignite a full scale economic warfare where Beijing actually holds very important leverage. What are the risk of retaliation here from the Japanese? There are many tools that Japan can use because, remember, they are very close neighbors. Their economies are very closely intertwined. Japan is the second largest export destination for China and the third largest source of imports. And they are selling a lot of these advanced equipments to China. And where Japan really dominates is the semiconductor industry. If Japan places a chokehold on export controls that it could really limit China's chips ambitions. And then you've got to think about whether President Trump would step in, as well as an ally of Japan that could really tilt the power balance. And if other countries in the West are spooked by what they see as an abuse of export controls from China, it risks alienating the Chinese economy even further as well. And this is coming, as we saw, of course, a very kind of warm reception that the South Korean president did get in China, too. Yes. So it's important to see the contrast there, because China is clearly sending a clear message He is willing to use its economic might to coerce other countries that do not sort of align with the one-China principle. But president really is getting a different treatment because he has specifically reassured China that Korea is going to respect that one-China principle. And in return, China is rewarding it by reviving this ministerial level economic dialogue that has been frozen since that that missile crisis. But again, South Korea is walking a very fine line here. It is also a close ally of the United States that perhaps could tap, you know, just how much it could lean toward China, because one thing China is still withholding is the lifting of that informal ban on Korean entertainment. South Korea has been pushing hard for that, but China has not yet really signaled that they will lift it yet. They give him a low there. China correspondent at the latest. When it comes to this, China and Japan, tensions there coming up. What are we talking ETFs with Moray as a global investment Hong Kong why they think investors well maybe take a look at when it comes to how Asia is faring here. E m certainly has been a hot, hot, hot spot to look at in the market here. And where you see these kind of flows will be for 2026. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back. It's the seventh calendar day. It's the third full trading day. So it's been a was a fantastic two days. As you can see. We're just pulling back a little bit after, of course, what was really a fantastic start to the year cost. You still, of course, all guns blazing, did catch a bit of a pause now, I think on Tuesday. But as you can see, 4500 now is what we were trading at very, very quickly. In case you missed that, there's a look at reports citing the PBOC and directly citing the PBOC itself, talking about how monetary policy in China will continue to remain generalizing here, a fairly supportive ten year yield. We've been talking about 1.9% 30 year yield now at 2.32 as the 30 year bond futures start trading on the lowest since 2024. Okay, so how do we make sense of price action and how it tells us where the best strategies will be for the year? Joining us here on set is Dennis FOK, chief ETF investment officer at MIRAE Asset Global Investment, Hong Kong. Good morning. Happy New Year. Good morning. Happy New Year. Nice to see you again. Yeah. Where would you last talk? I think it was 2024, right. I know one of the one of the forums. So a lot has changed since then. I think we've had 2025 where almost everything went up. I still continues to be, of course, front and center. Let me get started with sort of us asset dollar question How do investors need to be looking at potential performance of US assets this year? Yeah, I think it's a very good question. You know, for the last year into 2025, we are seeing fairly strong rally. You know, even though there are some volatility in terms of the point Mike had. However, you know, of course for the last two trading sessions, we are also seeing the continuous rally in the market. But the thing is that there is some interesting observation. If you remember last year, maybe at the beginning of January, there has been a lot of talk about the S & P 500 equal weighted index. What it means is that people were expecting that, you know, the valley would be bottoming last year. But the thing is that, you know, what we are observing from the data itself, he didn't realize in 2025, the S & P 500 equal weighted index underperformed 6%. But the thing is that for the last few trading action, we are seeing this actually reverse. What it means is that potentially the story about the air, you know, investment still will continue. What it means is that the index waiting for that individual seven still probably concentrated in the bull market is still would drive the market. But the thing is that what it means is that you know for other maybe always have the megacap and efficient seven are due to the adoption story potentially the market will be widening so that's much more healthier than maybe for the last five, maybe last five years. We are seeing that, you know, over 50% of the total return of the market index is driven by only a fairly concentrated bias kind of stock. Okay. So things could be running out in the US. We had a guess yesterday. Talk about us. Exceptions have been bruised. Do do you see further unwind of this whole U.S. exceptionalism sort of sort of trade or do you think that actually things could look a little bit better for the US this year? Yeah, that's a also another interesting question. The thing is that, you know, last year we have been seeing, you know, the weakening of the US dollar. This is primarily driven by the US Fed weaker cycle. We are now kind of in the beat cycle. What it means is that maybe some of the earliest cuts have been materialized already. The thing is that, you know, you based on the January, you know, FOMC business, I think a lot of our you know, officials are expecting potentially inflation. You know, us inflation has been motivating to 2%. What it means is that there could be some, you know, maybe 2 to 3 times of the weaker if there's no surprise in US inflation. What it means is that potentially there would be some you know we allocation from the you know, US exposure into the Asia market. That's what we are seeing, you know, fairly strong widely in the exchange index, you know, starting from last year. And that the thing is that, you know, for the last trading section, we are seeing the continuous valley and within Asia, as you were pointing out. In fact, let's put Jay in there because Chase, also an air play. Where do you think market leadership goes this year? Because it's been in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and then China? Yeah, I would say, you know, in terms of the extreme market, you know, for the last year, we are seen to, you know, fairly outperform most market, which are China and Korea. We are seeing, you know, China actually continued to perform for the last few trading section. I think one of the point that a lot of our in fact, investor may be a little bit surprised is that last year some of the technology heavy indices in China actually underperformed the market and also underperformed the dividend stock, for example, like some of the dividend bars can actually outperform more than 30% last year. But the. You have these, you know, index only, you know, increase by 1.5%. But the thing is that, you know, this year the outlook is a little bit different because I think similar to the U.S. story, a lot of AIG related investment is going to be materialized in China. And then when, of course, in China. Now, in the institutional space, people talk about, you know, the deep sea moment. But the thing is that, of course, the portending, you know, in us potentially will be China spreading, you know, outside of the US market. What it means is that potentially in China, other than, you know, the dividend stock, other than what market, you know, people also talk about, you know, China, Asia, you know, this year potentially will be a very positive year for that for that particular exposure. Yeah. I want to talk about your baby, which is, of course, three, 416 Hong Kong. This is because it's a very popular income strategy. Yeah. I mean 16% dividends last year. I mean is how important is income. Yeah. Strategies this year too. Yeah I would say you know if you'll take a look at the global, you know, investment who's think about you know during the U.S. weaker cycle you know maybe people cannot expect that the US rates can continue stay five if very high. Of course it would not jump to maybe you know, 1%. But the thing is that what it means is that people, you know, all over the world are looking for income harvesting. And the thing is that I just mentioned about that, you know, how strong performance for the China dividend stock. But the thing is that when the prices go up for the dividend install, it means that dividend you go down. Now, when I check the dividend yield of some of the popular, you know, China stocks is only at 16.4 6.5%. The thing is that, you know, in today's financial market, leveraging the option premium, leveraging part of the typical strategy to produce the alternative income could be quite interesting. That's why we are seeing, you know, very strong inflow for these type of product. They last year alone, we offset by one 2 billion just all inflow is one of the strongest inflow couple of core ETF in the world. So what it means is that you know the China market you know, continue to perform and you know the underlying asset, you know, for example, for these particular holidays, HCI potentially would be also very good performance. And the thing is that, you know, that's a fairly favorable environment for investing in copper coal, because the thing is that you would not expect very huge volatility, but at the same time at least you call and you know, portion of the option premium by, you know, benefiting from this kind of, you know, scenario. You give up though the upside as you know. Right. So this this strategy works for which type of investors, particularly if you expect global equities will continue to do well this year. Yeah, I would say, of course, no one has crystal ball how to actually predict the market. What we are trying to, you know, provide here is that, you know, think about, you know, if your portfolio for example you are holding some of the core as allocation. But the thing is that what if there are some volatility, You know, you know, reversion if you look at the global market like the VIX in U.S. is trading 50. But the thing is that the volatility can suddenly spike. So this type of strategy can pull y income especially is monthly distribution that at least during the types times of volatility, if your core asset allocation actually doesn't perform very well. But the thing is that at least you have to are more relatively stable of cash flow. Yeah. Oh, this one doesn't accumulate, right. It's distributed every month. Yeah. It's a monthly distribution. Okay. Sorry. That was just a point of the second point. What are some of the other sort of babies that you're watching out for, Right. Beyond just maybe the equity space? Maybe I'll talk about commodities that are firing alternative alternatives. I mean, what are some of the other things that you think could actually stand out for 2026? Yeah, yeah, that's a very interesting question. I would say, you know, of course, other than some alternative income, you know, people think about, you know, our fixed income, if you think about, you know, now is under the weights classical, you know, steel fixed income is very interesting even though you is no longer, you know, very high. But the thing is that people would take a look at, you know, for fixed income asset allocation, whether you want it bet on the nation versus the credit spread. My suggestion is that the credit spread. Now you say phobia low level. If you think about the US, AIG, you think or yeah yeah so that's why but the thing is that you know for the current weaker cycle we're in the mid-cycle I think for the duration less than five could be interesting because the thing is that the you know that the Fed would have more impact on the short end of Yukos. So that's why for the fixed income space, I think a lot of investors is looking at the, you know, intermediate or short term yield curve path to get alpha. All right, Denis, great to have you. Thanks for kicking off the year for us. Denis Faulk there, Chief Investment Officer, ETFs, ETF, Moray Asset, Global Investments here in Hong Kong. For more on what asset managers are really looking out for this year, you can check out this big take that's available on the terminal for subscribers. It's a good one. You got to click through a lot, but certainly it really highlights. All kind of I think it was like a few dozen other managers that they surveyed. They're super good on what the prospects are, the outlooks and of course, where the conviction lies, the function to use it. And I big take. We continue to track the headlines across it when it comes to Venezuela here this morning. And the latest is with President Trump not ruling out the use of military force to acquire Greenland. Now, the White House says he's discussing a range of options to acquire the Arctic island. But The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is downplaying military action, telling lawmakers the goal is to buy the island from Denmark. Bloomberg Lizzie Burton has more on why Trump has made Greenland a key foreign policy objective. Roughly three times the size of Texas. Greenland sits a strategically important location in the North Atlantic and Arctic. It has vast stores of critical minerals and fossil fuels coveted by the U.S. and its strategic rivals China and Russia. Buried beneath the ice sheets, climate change has made those resources more accessible than ever, and the thawing ice has opened up new trade routes between North America, Europe and Asia. Greenland is already home to the US's northernmost airbase, under a radar station that's used for detecting missiles and monitoring space. Gaining control over Greenland could give the US Government new opportunities to expand its military presence in the Arctic, as well as access to critical materials to build the economy of the future without relying on the likes of Beijing. You know, And on that on that very story, there's one specific stock. It's coming up on your screens. Energy transition minerals. It's listed in Oz. It has it's a miner there, but it has a to the point that Leslie was just making there on the many resources available. It has a rare earths project. It was up as much as 40% at one point has clearly come down ever so slightly. So we'll watch it closely. Of course, the stock is gaining the most in a couple of months up also gaining on the back of and this is still a a material story that's not pun intended. They're looking at nickel producers. So the first one is a big one, of course, listed here in in Hong Kong. Some of the others are listed across Asia. You have, of course, those in Indonesia, which has just come online, substantial gains after substantial gains in nickel prices in London. And of course, the gains we're seeing there specifically are also and pulling back a little bit on the London contract here in Shanghai. That's playing a bit of catch up to Korea. Automakers also in focus on the motor. And of course, some of its affiliates are also surging here today. And after these media reports of an executive chairs meeting with a video, CEO, Jensen Huang at CES. So the two I wonder if they had beer and chicken again. But yeah, ongoing excitement over robotics business. China export controls on Japan also seem to be supporting the auto sector in Korea. Here I could do with a pint of water. To be more specific. I'm a bit thirsty even though it's a bit cold out. I could do with some fried chicken though. Any day, any day, any time of the day. Any time of the day. Hyundai, by the way, speaking of what Yvonne just mentioned. Right. So it it it unveiled its humanoid robot. That was yesterday. So building on gains even further there, a quick glance at benchmarks going into the first 60 minutes of the cash market session. There you go. And this is Walmart. 11:29 a.m. in Tokyo. Japanese markets are heading to a lunch break. And yeah, we talked about the stock rally, also having a break as well here today on the back of these escalating tensions between China and Japan. That's weighed on the Japanese markets here today. Nikkei and topics are both lower by about 4/10 of 1%. The yen's around one 56.57 levels here this morning. So certainly that is one to watch. But, yeah, we're tracking, of course, I mean, the first four trading days have been quite strong, robust today it's just a little bit of an easing of that. Yeah, I mean, it can't continue at that rate. Otherwise it's what we said. What was it bad from the vertical horizon. Remember that. Oh yeah. There we go. Right. That would have been the look of the chart. But yeah, it's we'll get into of course the comeback, the resurgence of Asia tech. Right. So if you thought the change of the calendar meant a change of market leadership so far apart from today, that's not that's not the case. Right. Asia dashboard coming online. Yeah. Okay, let's have a look at that. Yeah. My brain's not funk. It's just calling cold. It's cold. Are you having some brain freeze? Yeah, it's really, really. It's really cold in here. I might not be able to continue getting cold degrees, but my apple, my. My phone. The weather app says it feels like two degrees colder. So, yeah, it's not the type of weather if you're nursing a heartbreak. No. Although if you have if you if you're if you if you do have though, if you're looking to flaunt a fleece ski jacket, this is probably the time to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's justified. I spotted at least five was Canadian Canada Goose. Canada Goose. Canadian goose. Sorry, duck. I get the jackets early this morning and we come into work very, very early. Right. So that just underscores the square meter per capita, two square meter of sightings there. Anyway, I digress. World leading hot market is in Korea. Have a look at it cost me right we're at 4500. We were below 2500 just last April and we're at 92% from that level. Right. So we're a good one or two days from effectively doubling over, what, just nine months? Yeah. And you talk about leadership. Obviously, Korea stands out in the region. What you break it down, I mean, it has been the likes of Samsung. Right. And in terms of, you know, the stock outperformance that we saw, it's the first time in three years basically where Samsung has actually beat us. Hynix, I would say the early parts of this of this year, I should say last year they were still there, but gap there. But certainly it's at a $350 billion in market value. And this whole narrative that, you know, there's a catch up story underway that maybe a Samsung is back. When you talk about the progress of AI, you talk about these huge price hikes for memory chips, Samsung stands to face these tailwinds as well. So analysts are expecting in terms of earnings are going to more than double this year to a record high and the market cap is not even close. I think we're only just I mean, less than half of that of TSMC. So maybe there is still further to catch up. Yeah, there is some upside there. Although on the TSMC note also coming in this morning was I think Jp morgan upped their price target on TSMC Samsung while the news got quite fittingly so just coming through right now Morgan Stanley has increased their six month price target on the clock speed to as to as high as 4800. This one just crossing just crossing the Bloomberg terminal. Right. So just fittingly, of course, as we as we discuss this, I think Macquarie raised it to 22,000 240,001, the price target there. So yeah, so ways to go, A ways to go. But yes, I'm sensitive. Yes, I think yeah. I mean the products of course at Las Vegas or generate some fresh buzz as well. We spoke exclusively with the company president and Chief marketing officer Jin Lee about their outlook amid continued optimism surrounding high. So this year our exhibition is themed. Your companion to AA Living. All right. So, you know, when others are calling this a home, we really wanted to go a step up and call this a living. Because with the breadth of products that we have, you know, we are with you in a very unique way and continuously throughout the day. So by understanding your needs, your behavior, whether it's from your mobile phones or TVs and fridges and washing machines and whatnot right there, we can really personalize the whole experience. It's a new purchases by new customers. Are you trying to increase the lifetime value of your existing customers? It's a little bit of both. I mean, you know, if you ask anyone whether A.I. is important for your products now and for the future, I think you're going to get a very consistent answer that it is important, right? But I think right now you need to futureproof your product more so than ever because of the speed at which A.I. is developing. You know, I've been in the industry long enough to see how technology has transformed our lives. You know, when we went from analog to digital to the Internet to the mobile Internet and so forth, you know, based on what I have witnessed over the years, I think the speed at which we're seeing AI is advancing is nothing like I've seen in the past. Right. Because the not only the technology itself is evolving fast, but adoption rate is also moving at a very, very fast pace. So the evolution of the technology itself, of course, IBM for chips will be crucial. And we have heard from Samsung CEO John Young on talking about how customers think Samsung is back because of this new product. How much does that improve the outlook for every other part of Samsung's business that you oversee appliances, TVs, smartphones, because that was such a dark cloud hanging over Samsung? Well, I think in 2026, yeah, there's going to be issues around semiconductor supplies and it's going to affect everyone, not just Samsung, I think is industry wide reality that we're going to see some supply issues with semiconductors. So that will certainly have an impact on all the connected devices that we make with the memories and so forth. But I think we're in a better place than most of other constituents in the industry just because of the scale of the business that we run on a global basis. What will the strategy be if you need to implement those price hikes? Well, I think and again, this is going to affect us the same way right now when when memory prices go up, it's going to have an impact on the price of products. So I don't think we're immune to those those issues. When are we going to see that transport prices are going up even as we speak? So, you know, obviously, we don't want to convey that burden to the consumers, but we're going to be at a point where we have to actually consider repricing our products. And you were saying that this affects everyone in the industry. What's your competitive edge now, for example, in segments like televisions? Because I know that, for example, Samsung's frame has been very popular, right? You have artwork in the home as TVs. You've seen a wave of clones from other TV makers. This year you have LG, for example. How do you stay ahead? Well, you know, competition is nothing new to Samsung right now. We've been the number one TV maker for 20 years running. So, yeah, we've had various types of competition over the years. Well, you know, this time around, you know, we're seeing a lot of cheap TVs coming to the market, Right. You know, a 75 inch costs 75 inch TV costs far less than what it used to cost. Right. But I think we look at the competition in a slightly different way. You know, I think you just mentioned our frame TV, right? It's not just about watching TV. Right. It brings another angle to your viewing experience at home. Right. You get to enjoy the artwork. Right. In addition to watching Netflix and Amazon and whatnot, I think that's a really another angle that we've been pursuing. Well, this time around, as our exhibition indicates, you know your companion to AA living. Right. So we're really trying to elevate our competitive landscape from competing in TV space, competing in mobile or home appliances. You know, the combined experience of, you know, Samsung portfolio products. Right. Really gives you a differentiated experience versus something that is offered by another competitor as a single item or a single category of products. So as we're seeing now, these price hikes come through and not only in Samsung, but also, of course, among other device makers. What's your demand outlook for the year, especially given that companies like Samsung as well have suffered from tariffs last year? I'm a member of our Digital experience division where we make end products like mobile phones, TVs and home appliances. You know, these are industries that are expecting to see a modest growth. So but I think just looking at our outlook of the business, I think we're going to be able to outpace the market. How will they compared to last year, especially given that is a challenging base? You saw a lot of people preempting purchases because of the tariffs. I think we're going to be doing okay. Yeah, I think we're we're more optimistic about the outlook of 2026 than what we have experienced last year at the devices and sectors. Yes. In which sectors? Mobile phones. I mean, I think with the emergence of I think people are looking at upgrading their products and be able to leverage the new technologies that are embedded into our products. When it comes to the price hikes, how difficult is it for you to market it to customers? I can't say it will not have an impact, but, you know, obviously we're trying not to pass that burden to the customers as much as we can. And that was the Samsung president and chief marketing officer, John Lee, speaking with Sherry at CBS. We're just getting some breaking lines here when it comes to our here from China. So regulators are now talking about banning platforms from forcing merchants to join promotions. So this is, of course, affecting some of these online platforms with these management measures here. They were already following I have to mind you there before this news, but certainly does lead to a bit more questions about where these price wars lie, the fact that the regulators are once again starting off the year talking about the need to stop these sort of discounts here and to really put an end to these price wars or at least slow it down. Yeah, they're removing the incentives that lead to lower prices right now. Separately, and this is a separate release that's also around specific rules that China is now issuing management. China has issued management measures for live streaming e commerce. It's now banned live streamers from making. Well, this is almost stating what's necessary, really. China's ban is famous for making false advertising claims. There's a full statement in Mandarin. We'll get into it once we have more details, Steve. But yes, these are two separate things. And I imagine these are the two things we'll be talking more of over the coming over the coming days. Markets are reacting slightly, but as you point out, we were already down ahead of the breaking news in the last few minutes or so. All of those beginning of four or five trading sessions of 2026 have been about there's optimism around tech. Right. And our Bloomberg intelligence team thinks 2026 will cement Asia's tech ascendancy with the likes of China and Japan, consolidating their positions as key global players. Let's bring in our big thematic strategist, Shirley Wong. She joins us now. So in terms of themes, what are you watching over this year? Yeah, thank you for having me. It certainly is going to be an exciting year this year. And basically the conversation is still going to be around, A.I., still going to dominate conversations. But we think that that conversation has shifted somewhat into infrastructure. And, you know, talking about things like data centers, power grids and so forth. So we think that investors are taking a more picks and shovels approach, looking at some of the tools and services that provides you the AI industry. Yeah, part of the thesis here is also the nuance within AI, right? So I wonder if you could be more specific along the different themes that investors should be paying attention to because people look at A.I. and it ties into one basket and it's, you know, you find alpha and what's not too. What's, you know, what's gone unnoticed. Yeah. I like to think of it as two groups, you know, those that are companies that are from the source of the AI industry, you know, along the value chain of the API chain. You know, you see those that actually provide the energy, the power, the infrastructure. So that's one set of groups are there. And then the other group would be the downstream players, the ones other end users of API. So within the infrastructure we have a newly launched theme is called a computer infrastructure theme, and that really tracks a basket of companies that are involved in the physical structure, like the construction of the data centers and and that could range from everything from like cooling systems around the data center to even the physical security of the data center. And then we also have the great tech theme, and that one has done quite well last year, you know, has outperformed the utilities benchmark index. And so the power of great tech theme is basically companies that are involved in sort of like the the upkeep and the maintenance and the modernization, the upgrade of the power grid. And, you know, for the Asian shares for these power grid companies, they have actually performed over 30% in the last year or so. Yeah, a lot of that is is in China. As you as you mentioned, they might actually steal the spotlight in terms of let's talk about 91st market. Are there themes that are not AI related that you think could still be good opportunities this year? Yeah, I mean, everything's around AI, but if you have to look at some of these companies out there, blockchain is one of them that has been overshadowed by A.I. technology and blockchain companies are really, you know, like the foundation for not only cryptocurrency trading, despite some of the volatility that we've seen there with Bitcoin, but also the foundation for tokenization trends. You know, so these are companies that are looking to place some of their financial assets on chain, and it also has industrial uses as well. You know, like blockchain is also a part of the smart contracts that we've seen in some of these, you know, companies along the supply chain. And logistics. And also, you know, there's a lot of noise last year about geopolitics, about global trade tensions. So I like to call these groups of companies, strategic tech companies. And these are companies that are critical to a nation's, you know, self-sufficiency along the supply chain and also to their economy. And so these strategic tech companies would include things like our fantastic quantum computing space technology, as well as the rare earth elements in transition metals theme is also quite important as well. Yeah, So our our viewers and clients are probably wondering what those names are. You can check that out for our clients by go of course on on your Bloomberg terminals. That was Shirley Wang, our thematic strategist of course out of Bloomberg Intelligence. So we'll have more from you. Speaking of the broader tech conversation from CBS in the next hour, Daniel Newman will be joining us at those times on your screens. If you're watching out of Hong Kong, it's 1030 in the evening. If you're joining us out of the out of New York this is morning. Copper pricing is actually going up in the cloud. All of the all of the hoppers are consumed in cloud and and now pricing, spot pricing is starting to go up. And so that tells you about the the demand that's being generated all over the world. So H2O, I think is going to contribute also to and I think all told, all told, I, I think we should have a very good year. Yeah. The man that moves the markets with just a just a few comments. In fact, when you look at memory. Right. And I think what he also said there was storage is a completely unserved market today. And you had a massive move up in the likes of SanDisk at 28%, I believe, in the U.S. I think we're seeing that here as well in the Asia Pacific. Memory chips coming up on your screens already very shortly. So there we go. Yeah. Remember this memory on the way up. The other one is we just talked in case you're joining us right now right earlier segment with would surely want we discussed the thematics around air infrastructure and cooling stocks right a lot of money got into that specific subtheme and Jensen Huang effectively poured cold water on that and said when you look at what Rubin is able to do, it's able to cool the racks using water at temperature that does not require a water chiller. There we go. So just the frontier of that technology sort of makes you re retest your thesis around some of the key themes here. Yeah. I'm still trying to get around that crack leather that he the jacket that he's wearing as well. But yes, obviously it's not just about the connection that I won't be able to see. He has it's always going to be about the products and the gadgets and like. And check out this one. I think this is great. This Chinese company, Robo Rock, has unveiled, get this, a robot vacuum cleaner with two legs that can climb stairs in people's homes. Obviously, you know, if all we need is a duplex nowadays. Yeah, but yes, it's so cute. I should go upstairs. It's got 3D spatial information, several motion sensors and can raise and lower its legs independently So I can go up and down the stairs. Even down, of course, little steep hills as well, and navigate uneven services. So cool stuff. Obviously, we all would love one of these at home. But again, there's not an article. So right to your point, we there's probably not a very big market for this space anywhere these days or levels really as well. But it can't clean on the steps, though. No, no, no. So I was I think the ones that have been coming in the past cannot I don't know if this one can or cannot. Okay. But, you know, there's still a lot of questions about this this sort of technology. Right. Because there are some challenges. Their high prices, the one they launched last year was, I think north of 20 $500 us. So the price tag is certainly one thing. The one last year they launch was completely different. They were talking about how I can pick up socks on the floor. Yeah, which I would love to have because I have a husband that does this a lot at home. Pick up the socks or just leave us off. Leave the out. Okay. But yes, so, but they said that it was only specific on certain items. And then I know a lot of people question what if it falls right. Can it kind of pick yourself up? You know, they they you know, we don't really know if they can. It can turn to look at that. So in order for it to actually be mainstream, I think it's still got to deal with some of these obstacles as well. Yeah. I wonder if you can circle back to that. Yeah. That scene of climbing, climbing the stairs, how much does it go for in the previous version was quite, quite pricey. More than $2,000. Oh yeah, Yeah. Here we go. So, you know what this reminds me of? What? I have a few friends that after they've had a few, this is how they go off. This is. This is probably how they look. This is probably not clean. The floor is either. Maybe they are or their clothes. Yeah, yeah. But yes, they're making also a role. I mean, robots are huge at CES this year and I think they made a whole section just for for robots. Right. So you got to check it out. I think there's one that also sorts and folds laundry. I need that as well. Anyways, we'll be live in Seattle all week. Yes. And Las Vegas. And tomorrow we're hearing from Hitachi as well as Hyundai Motor as they have, of course, a new humanoid robot designed for work in working in car factories. Right up. Just some news in the last few minutes or so around platform companies. But it's it's it's it's an old theme. But I think we have more details now on how this might work in terms of intense competition will certainly have more on this in the coming days, weeks and months. It will be a very big feature of shows, I would imagine, in 2026. Apart from this, we're looking at the Hang Seng index. We're about 90 minutes into the catch market session there. And I think the story really has not been about the Hong Kong markets so far, although separately, you know, the listing market has still continued to fire on all cylinders. It's strong January already. Yeah, I think it's the best. We're set for the best January. Yeah. Ever. Right. And we're what, two, seven days here? And we have just to say we have two big listings this week that we're looking at two right. The Thursday and Friday anyway. Apart from that geopolitics rearing its ugly head, showing up on the Asian benchmark. How about the Asia-Pacific benchmark being dragged down by Japan? That's it for me. That's it from us here on the China show. Perfect time for a stumble because we're done for the day. We'll see you all tomorrow.

Bloomberg's Mike McGlone joins to discuss with Paul Sweeney and Scarlet Fu. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nMacro is crude oil prices are going down. It's a bear market. It's what the Trump administration wants and the curious partisan methods he's using that's just entertaining to watch. And everything I see is he's going to get what he wants to get crude oil prices lower. So what I think the good news is to people who like to be bullish crude oil, which typically doesn't go up and stay up, is I think we're getting towards the lower end of a narrow low price cure stage, which means maybe around $42 a barrel if history is an example. But anything up and any bonds now 65 would hold resistance. The bottom line is, as our colleague, our blast has pointed out, the whole America is from North America down to South America, become a price maker in crude oil and commodities. And taking that away from that used to be a price taker, which is that's where that trend is at the moment. Okay. So we have control over our destiny. We set the price as opposed to receive it and have to contend with it. Yeah. The president says Venezuela will send anywhere from 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, worth about $2.8 billion at current market prices. Is 50 million barrels a lot? It sounds like a lot. Well, it's not really a lot. Let's put that in context. The US and Canada combined export have a net surplus of about 8 million barrels a day, and that's compared to a deficit of around 2 million barrels just ten years ago. So it's the trend that's happening. A lot of those barrels that we're going to China will not be going to China in more. And that's the key thing is, is that more geopolitical now with the Trump administration asking Venezuela, push away from China and Russia and Iran. But the bottom line is crude oil in the bottom is heading lower, but such as crude oil, the weakest commodity so far. One a week is coming so far. This is natural gas. I'll get in. I'll give you a headline In about a month, you're going to be able to say natural gas. A front contract is around $2 per mm. BTU that April contract is 2.8. Just a month ago it was four. As we cycle down in natural gas, that's the whole area that all the energy complex is heading that way. We're on the bottom. This is the key question. Yeah, I'm just pulling up my GLC oh page Global Commodities and it breaks it down between energy, metals, agriculture. It's a great, great screen. Henry Hub Natural gas that's been at for north of $4 for like a long time. It's $3.50 right now. So it's happening right, Right. And that's the winter contract. That's a front contract. But the contracts, Paul, that's anticipating those tulips coming up in New York, that's those the ones are going to get hammered. So just when you reported in hopefully about two months from now, Mr. Trump will be delighted to hear you're going to be able to say to handle on natural gas versus just a month ago for that front contract, it was closer to five. But that's a key thing, is natural gas. Had we had a colder than normal winter last year, increase that demand. But now we're realizing the trend in global warming is probably consistent.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:38:31 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T17:45:59.208445"}

Is that true? What are you guys up to? Well, I would say that we've always been known as a disciplined investor. We talk about purchase price matters. We talk about alignment with our investors. And I think that with that statement is it's really about the gauntlet for approving investments that Apollo has gotten higher and higher over the last year or so. As we see an environment that down the fairway, I'll use a golf analogy down the fairway, you've got a lot of great things going on, you know, massive CapEx cycle, good economic growth, consumer and solid shape, you know, a variety of great attributes. That being said, the rough weather, there's lots of challenges between geopolitics, between the concern about inflation, between the concern about the return of invested capital. And I, there's a variety of left tail items that have certainly grown in stature. You know, as I as I listen to some of the macro commentary here, I think there's a great deal of humility about the macro view of how the predictions as I meant, I've said here many times, we said here after SVB, we all thought massive capital slowdown in spending and credit crisis. The US economy really was massively resilient. You guys talked earlier about what's going on with that with the deficit. I think it's a little bit it's the economy, stupid, the US economy. People just don't want to short the the great momentum of what's going on. And we have a we have an administration that's very politically savvy about populist topics. He's been very responsive. But I again, I this goes back to us, back to the question you had. We're putting money to work. This week was a busy week. We announced 6 billion of deals of transactions, all great companies. Again, we're leaning into larger companies that are part of the global industrial Renaissance one. With that, Brad Jacobs, a 4035 year winner in the building products space, the second one with Russell Investments, really simplifying their capital structure. And then the last transaction was very interesting, actually, it was for Valor X, it was really a sale leaseback on a massive amount, 5 billion of Nvidia chips. So all three really interesting transactions, but really well structured downside risk. And I think that's our view right now. We want we want to be investing capital, but you got to acknowledge you can wake up on a on a Saturday morning and see us with, you know, activities around the globe that really enhances the the tail risk of geopolitics. You can get a stroke of the pen announcement yesterday with regard to housing. And so I think you have to be very, very careful about how you invest long term at scale. To extend the analogy, though, to your point, the fairway is getting narrower, the rough is getting deeper. In the last few years, it's not been that way. Allocating risk and you'll perform. You'll do well within a tougher environment. The analogy for golf, for those who play a lot of golf is we're at the US Open. The US Open is known for tight fairways and really punitive rough, and if you keep in the fairway, you're going to be a great victor and you're going to have great success. I think there's going to be, as last year will remind us, you can have some bumps in the road during the course of the year that definitely change the trajectory on liquidity and momentum and risk appetite. So but I think the long term trend is quite positive. But I do think you have to be very measured about how you execute your business model.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:19:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T13:48:03.419745"}

So let's start there. Where are you for this year? Is your thought? What are you looking for? Yes. So I'm unsurprisingly the lowest that I'm looking for. About a point and a half of cuts. A lot of that is driven by my view of inflation. I gave a speech about this and, you know, about a month ago in December at Columbia University. My view is that almost all of the excess inflation over target is due to quirks of how we calculate inflation. So as you have talked about with many of your guests many times before, shelter inflation really, really lags a lot. And because average tenant rents have caught up to new tenant rents, because market rents have been running at a 1% rate for a couple of years now, I think it's appropriate to sort of think about underlying inflation as as abstracting from that a little bit. You know, the shelter inflation is indicative of a supply demand imbalance for 2022, 2023, not 2027. We need to be making policy for 2027 because policy lags. And other side of it is the portfolio management fees that I'm sure you've talked about again with many your guests many times. Stock market went up mechanically. Inflation was higher despite many of your other guests, I'm sure no doubt telling you about fee compression in the asset management industry for decades seems track from those two things.

He's on this week's episode of The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations. This interview was recorded June 26 at the 92nd Street Y in New York.  (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nThis is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor the highest calling of mankind. I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. Oh, I watch your interviews because I know how to do something. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said. 250. I said, Fine. I didn't negotiate with him. I didn't know due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world. Is that right? More than 50 years ago, a young Harvard Business School graduate, Ray Dalio, started a hedge fund. BRIDGEWATER That fund became the largest hedge fund in the world and one of the most successful in the world. Over this period of time. He's writing a number of books, and his most recent book talks about his concern about debt in the United States and around the world. I had a chance to sit down with Ray Dalio to talk about his views about investing. In recent months, one of the most common things talked about is something called tariffs. What is your view on tariffs as a good economically bad economic? Is going to solve our budget problem because I think in the big beautiful bill, a lot of money that's coming in comes in from tariffs and that helps reduce the deficit a bit. Tariffs. Tariffs are not bad. Throughout history, tariffs were the main source of government revenue and so on. And any form of taxes has its cost. So capital gains taxes are bad and so on. Different things have their costs. I think the question is how well executed? How big are they? How disruptive are they in terms of the process? They can bring a significant. There's something to be said for them in that they bring in a significant amount of revenue. That means that there is less that needed elsewhere. And we're now in a different world. We're in a world where the world is. Almost at war self-sufficiency. We have to build self-sufficiency. We cannot continue to borrow or depend on imports for that. And so there's a manufacturing. How do you create manufacturing in the United States? And so there's some merit to all of those arguments. The question is whether that is done really well and so on for the whole world. Tariffs, of course, are not the ideal you would like to have if you're dealing what's best for the whole world. You would like to have the least efficient inefficiency. You'd say wherever they produce it the best and we have it go around. But we're in a world now that we have to be realistic in terms of we cannot be dependent on importing a lot of things, and nor can the world be dependent on the value of the bonds and the debt that we're acquiring in order to pay for those things. Well, the big, beautiful bill that's now being talked about, would that solve our problem to mitigate it or what it will do? It's not going to solve our problem. Okay. So if that's not going to solve our problem, how are we going to solve this problem? We're going to do it the way that we always do it. And it's always done when countries essentially go broke. What they do is they through a combination of devaluing the currency. Printing of money. There's an imbalance. The print money devalue the currency and create an artificially low interest rate so that the person who's holding the bonds is receiving an artificially low interest rate. That's the way Japan has done it with their local. And that's the way we will do it. So in other words, my grandchildren and great grandchildren not yet born, are going to be paying off this debt in devalued dollars, more or less going to happen faster than that. Faster than that. Oh, okay. I think they'll probably be on that. What about cutting interest rates? Why doesn't the chairman of the Fed say, well, cutting interest rates will save us money? We're spending $1,000,000,000,000 now on interest for our own debt. Why don't we just lower the interest rate? Why don't we just do that? There is the real interest rate and one man's debts or another man's assets. And so if I lower the interest rate, I will reduce my desire to hold that bond. And in my opinion, if you do that too much, you will lose the demand for that those bonds. You unlike if you do create something closer to the 4% cut in the expenditures, 4% increase in the tax revenue, improve the balance, then you'll have a benefit. If you try to force interest rates down, you are hurting those who are holding the bonds and you will lose the demand for the bonds. And you can create that spiral. Before we finish this discussion, I want you to just wrapped it up for a moment and say, look, you've scared me a bit, but I need to make money. I'm an investor. What should I do to take advantage of what you just described and scared me? Should I go buy gold or should I go buy dollars? Buy euros? What should I do? Look at the value of your portfolio in inflation adjusted terms, not in nominal terms. Okay. And the safest investment that you can get right now is an inflation indexed bond. Because what you'll get is it'll be indexed and you'll get a bit over 2% real return above inflation and whatever happens. So you start with what is a safe investment. The next thing I think you have to do is, is diversify your portfolio. We talked about the powers of diversification, so why don't want to get anybody into one bit because I'm going to be wrong. But do consider that gold is a form of money and gold is that is central banks are acquiring gold now as a diversifier. And so in your it also is negatively correlated with most of the things that you have done in a time of great stress. And what you'll find is that the gold will do well and when the assets don't. The world used to have gold as money. That was the way. And so the world would look at things differently. They would look at the prices of things in gold terms. Now, because we have fiat money and we've become used to it. We look at the prices of things in money terms and we look at gold that way. I think if you started to say it's money, it's a source of money, and you have that, that's part of the diversify. So it would diversify your portfolio. It's a prudent thing to have somewhere between ten or 15% of your portfolio in gold. For thousands of years, people have liked gold and people still seem to like gold. Price of gold are going up. Why are people so interested in owning gold in a time like this? Since 1750? 80% of the world's money have disappeared and all of those that existed have been greatly devalued. That's one of the reasons that gold is a store hold of wealth and has been for a long time. And there's a saying that gold is the only asset that you can have that's not somebody else's liability. And what they mean by that is that you don't have to receive money from somebody else in the world that we're now in and we're seeing it internationally. There is a worry about sanctions. There's a worry about taking gold. Those holders, central banks around the world are concerned about the possibility that, let's say, what happened to Russia could happen to them and so on. So there's a diversification of that, and it creates a dynamic in and of itself, because what happens is if they are switching and they are switching to gold away from bonds and so on, then that has the effect of not only making our supply demand balance that we're talking about, about the new deficit. It means that you can have the selling of gold, which makes that supply demand balance worse. Now, it used to be the case that the US dollar was backed by gold, and the US government said, If you don't like these pieces of paper, we'll give you gold. And ultimately we ended that. We're never going to go back to that, presumably, right? Probably. Presumably. That's right. But not if you watch these gold say these cycles because you have the devaluation, then people feel they don't have confidence in the fiat system over a period of time and through history. They at that point, the way it works is you print all this money, then you pray the debt with the cheap money and that, but nobody wants to hold it. So then they go back and link it again. It is conceivable that you can see a re linking of gold to money, but that's way in the future. Since the beginning of this year, the dollar against the basket of currencies is down about 10% and many people are worried that that might continue that way be devalued. Some people say it's not a bad thing because we can sell things more cheaply overseas and increase our exports. But if people are worried about the dollar going down in value, what would you suggest they do? Buy other currencies or go buy things that are not dollar denominated? I think their concern would be some version very similar to the seventies you just talked about. I remember I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on August 15th, 1971, and that is when Richard Nixon got on the television and he said in his polite way, this was a wonderful move. But the money that you thought you had, the gold was money. And what at the time people thought were real, the money that we're used to, they would say, are like checks in the checkbook. They said, you're not going to get your money. You can keep the checks at that point. Then we began the seventies, and the seventies was a period in which there was both stagflation. The thing that we have to worry about is a stagflation area environment because all the currencies went down. So when you were looking at diversification, the problems that we're talking about are not just American problems. We have a significant problem. But if their European problems, their Japanese problems, there's Chinese problems. No, there's we've lived on promises to be able to take that debt asset and convert it into money. And now there's not enough money to go around. So I would say that when you ask the question, would I devalue in relationship to other currencies? Probably. But the other currencies won't want much of an appreciation. And so that's why I'm saying that something like gold will breed the better performing currency. Some people worry about this and can tell us whether this is realistic or not. In 1985 there was something called the Plaza Accords where the United States government agreed with other governments that we were going to devalue the dollar illegally officially, and it was done in secret. Nobody knew it was coming. Is that a possibility that the government of United States could again agree with other governments? We're going to devalue the dollar further. You think that's unlikely these days? No, I think it's it's possible that. Yes, it's so interesting in history. When you look at what happens when governments are in certain positions all through history, they do the same things. Okay. And that means that a move like that or even there could be foreign exchange controls, there can be different ways that that that that happens. Now, my perception is that people in Washington always say, well, if the situation was that bad, the bond market would collapse. And then the bond market people say, well, the situation that bad Congress wouldn't do this. And they both kind of blame each other for not doing anything. Why hasn't the bond market collapsed ever? The fact that we have all this debt over all these years, you know, like they say, I've experienced this many times. I did this analysis in 27 and eight. I went to Congress and everybody said they asked me the same question. But we had the problem. Same thing happened in Europe. So there's a supply demand. There's a saying, you know, that everything goes slowly until it happens all at once. When the problem happens, you know, these things happen like that. How long did it take you to write this book? This is how many books have been written. Four four. Okay. And how long does it take to write a book like this? This is research that I've done over a long period of time. So putting it together and getting it out, you know, I would say a part time basis, maybe over a year. So you built the biggest hedge fund in the world. What's the relative pleasure of building of the biggest hedge fund in the world versus writing a book that's a bestseller? As you would know, probably it's a stage in life thing. You know, there's a stage in life where, you know, you're competing, you build something, and then there's a stage in life where you're passing things along, you know? So at this stage in life, you and your way, me and my way, it's a great, great joy to be able to pass along what I've learned. So I'm loving it. This book is designed to make people feel good or to scare people. Neither it. I wanted to convey the mechanics, the cause effect, relationships so that people can understand what's going on and then navigating it. I think it's a book that will make people worry. But I have a principle, which is if you worry, you don't have to worry. And if you don't worry, you need to worry because if you worry about something, then maybe you'll prevent what you're worrying about. When did you decide to become a writer as opposed to just an investor? I mean, a lot of great hedge fund investors just keep sitting in front of screens and so forth. When did you say, I want to do more than sitting in front of screens? Was that couple of years before you decided to exit Bridgewater? No, it was maybe 35, 40 years ago. What I learned was that if I was whenever I was making decisions, if I would pause and reflect and write down the criteria that I would use to make that decision, it would make me think more deeply about it. And then I learned that I could put those into code and then back test them so I would know how my decision making would work. And so right from then 35 years ago, that's how really I built Bridgewater was. What are the criteria? Test the criteria over a period of time and then form a game plan. So I'd say 35 years ago, I've written down I call these things principles, I've written down probably, you know, I don't know a thousand of them or something. For those who haven't followed the hedge fund world. You you're from Long Island. You went to Long Island University. You would say you were not a superstar in high school. On the contrary. But you did very well at Long Island University. And eventually you got in the Harvard Business School and you started your career. And your career almost went south when you punched your boss in the mouth, right? No, that was my my opportunities began. I got fired. What? I got fired. Then I sort of got fired. You started your own firm and you borrowed some money at some point from your father because the firm hadn't done that well. And what? Did you ever think that maybe you weren't going to make it and at the point that you were so young? Let me tell you about that incident, because it was one of the worst cases and one of the best cases for me. So this is 1980, 81. And I had calculated that the United States lent more money to countries that are never going to be able to pay back and that there would be a big debt crisis. And then and that happened. Volcker type money, 1982. Mexico defaults on its debt. And I got a lot of attention because I anticipated this and I thought I was right and I couldn't have been more wrong. I thought we were going to have a big economic crisis because of this. And what happened instead was the stock market went up, the ease monetary policy and I a terrible mistake and it cost me money. I was so broke that I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad in order to pay for family bills. And this was painful. And that changed my approach to everything. Two ways. Two ways. First, it made me think, How do I know I'm right? It gave me the humility I needed to balance with my audacity. And it let me understand how do I play this game going forward? And I understood the power of diversification and how diversification could reduce risk by up to 80% without reducing returns. And that was then the bottom of Bridgewater. And then from then on, it was straight because of the lesson I learned writing down these things in these experiencing and making the most out of mistakes as learning experiences has been learned. Investor You always have ups and downs. Nobody does everything perfectly, not even Warren Buffett Right. But you know what? What changed that from that point the returns were in my. 30 some odd years since of doing that. Since that point, it was, I think about 11.8% return with no year down significantly other than 2000 to 2020 during COVID and that was down 13%. But the other years were down like 2% because I learned the power of diversification. You know, one of the things about diversification is that you can reduce the returns, the risks, without reducing the term. My mantra is 15 good, uncorrelated return streams because you if you if they engineered to have about the same expected return and you have that kind of diversification, you will lower the risk by about 80%, which raises the return to risk ratio by a factor of five. So that's the power of of of the game play. And that's what helped me make your work and your passion the same thing. And don't forget about the money part. In other words, I didn't work for money, but I had a passion. I fell in love with the game of investing you. What about yourself? Why don't you go into government? What have you thought about? You're being secretary, Treasury. Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Run for the Senate or something and solve those problems while you're in government. Have you ever thought of that? Scares the daylights out of you. Let me say I have the greatest appreciation and respect for those who go into public service and serve in this kind of an environment. And I think there's a question of whether with the population, it's not just a leadership question, it's a can you lead question. You can bring capable people into that job. But we're in we're in a situation where everybody's fighting over every decision all the time. And and we'll tear everybody down if there. So it's a very difficult situation. Now somebody is watching. They say, I want to be the next Ray Dalio, who builds a gigantic hedge fund, does well financially, well respected by people, writes bestselling books. What's the secret to that? What do you do? Make your work and your passion the same thing. And don't forget about the money part. In other words, I didn't work for money, but I had a passion. I fell in love with the game of investing. And I think you have to make your work in your passion the same thing. But you do have to pay attention to the money part, because if you're not earning an adequate amount of money, then that's a problem. So what? And I don't think the best life is for those who make the most amount of money. And there's a very low correlation between the level of happiness or well-being past the basic level of income, the highest. Really? You're just telling me that now? Wow. Here's what we know so far. Which has the highest level of happiness and well-being generally is a sense of community. Do you have a sense of community? Your friends in that community? But anyway, I would say don't overexaggerate the power of money. You need to have enough and you have to pursue your passion and and, you know, have enough money. And it's if it's if it's never work, if you're pursuing your passion, what do you think is the best investment vehicle for a middle class American that is risk adverse and an inflation index bond, which is index fund, tips Treasury Inflation-protected securities because it will guarantee you a real return. And I don't think that you should be speculating in the markets because there's a zero sum game and you'll probably be the loser. So as we get ready to celebrate next year, the 250th anniversary of this country. Are you optimistic about our future or is the debt problem so concerning to you? You're not optimistic about our future? I think it's a time horizon. We're going to go. I think I think we can deal with this. I think it comes down to how we are with each other. But we will go through this and we will get to the other side. Okay. And when you go meet with members of Congress or other people in government and you talk about these serious issues of debt and deficit and so forth, do they listen? And then they say, by the way, what should I do with my own money? They are asking how they should invest their money or they never they never ask you for investment tips? Not typically. Now, what about when you go to a cocktail party? People ask you for investment ideas all the time here and there, I guess, is let me reverse the question. What do they do with you? Well, I'm not as good an investor as you are, so it worked out pretty good. Mostly say to me, Do you know Ray Dalio? So, Ray, look, I'd like to congratulate you on your incredible success. You came from very modest means. Work your way up. 50 years as an investor, built the biggest hedge fund in the world, and you've contribute a lot to endowments and others who've been your investors. So you should be very proud of what you've achieved now. I hope you can make some progress in Washington. I've been living there for a while. It's not that easy to make progress, as you know, but hopefully you'll continue and maybe some people will say they don't want to get re-elected. They just want to do the right thing. Hopefully you convince them. Thanks very much. Thank you.

Bloomberg's Zoe Tillman joins to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nBack in April when the president announced his reciprocal tariffs, the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, a handful of small businesses and a coalition of states filed suit. And for the most part, that was it. For most of the year, much of the business world did not get involved, stayed on the sidelines. Talking with trade lawyers, what they told us was there was a fear of blowback for stepping out against the administration. A number of companies wanted to wait and see what happened before sticking their necks out. But as the year drew to a close, the Supreme Court heard arguments. There was some sense that perhaps key members of the conservative wing were skeptical and the tariffs might fall. We are suddenly seeing a flood of businesses going into court, wanting to make sure that they've done everything they can to try to get refunds. If the court rules against the tariffs in the coming days or weeks. These cases are building off of those original lawsuits. They're not raising new claims. What they're saying is we agree that the tariffs are unlawful and if they fall, we think we should get our money back. So it's really a preemptive approach that these companies are taking at this point. So more than 100 corporate entities are now involved in the legal fight, including some big household company names like Costco. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. What's the feeling in legal circles here about how this Supreme Court case might go and what it might mean for some of these people that would like to get some of their money back? Right. And I should say the vast majority of companies that have sued so far are small businesses that perhaps most conservatives, consumers have never heard of. But we talked with owners who told us that the amounts that they're paying several thousand dollars, tens of thousands of dollars have been a huge hit to their bottom line and their ability to staff stock goods and so on. That said, you know, the arguments on November 5th, we saw key members of the court asking very skeptical questions about the lawfulness of the president's use of this 1977 economic emergency powers law to impose the tariffs. And once that happened, there were at least some companies that said, you know, the odds seem at least good enough that we're willing to now take steps to publicly come out against this policy. It's certainly not the case for all. We talked to lawyers who said some didn't fear the blowback. They just didn't see a need to do this until until recently. Some read headlines crossing the Bloomberg terminal here, Visa of Venezuela Assembly President Rodriguez on state television says that Venezuela should release important number of prisoners. And that's according to Venezuela Assembly President Rodriguez. So we'll have more reporting on that going forward. Zoe, is there a mechanism for, I don't know, the government, I guess, to return some of these tariffs back to companies that paid them? So there is precedent for this, just not on the scale that we would expect to see if the Supreme Court strikes down these tariffs. A number of years ago, there was a harbor maintenance tax that the Supreme Court struck down and that resulted in roughly 4000 companies going to a U.S. trade court to get refunds for the money that they had paid to the government. According to a court filing in December, looking at roughly 300,000 importers so far that have paid these contested tariffs on something like 30 plus million entries of goods into the United States. So there is a process that the trade court has used before to handle sort of a mass refund process. And there's been some expectation in some of the filings that we've seen that everyone expects that to be the way this unfolds if the tariffs are struck down. That said, you know, the administration could certainly say, you know, maybe there's an administrative process that we want to use that doesn't go through the courts. They haven't proposed anything like that and have mostly discussed this as if they to anticipate needing to go through the courts.

But the cohort has since cooled its buying, and the attacks slowed.  Bloomberg's Jeffrey Langbaum joins to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIt's one of those things that's been a target for politicians for some time because it's a very easy political message to sell. You're going after the big institutions that are crowding out the individual homebuyers, making prices too expensive. But at the end of the day, you know, these are these are well-run institutional landlords of rental homes, not unlike, you know, apartment homes. And, you know, I think that at the end of the day, if what he is suggesting he wants to do gets done in some capacity. You know, the net result probably winds up being less home inventory, which probably ends up making offsetting any positive impact on pricing that he would be looking to accomplish. Well, the only I don't know much about this business, but are they how big is institutional ownership of residential real estate in the U.S. these days? It's tiny. You know, it's I've seen numbers. It's only a couple percent of the overall housing stock. Maybe a little bit more of the overall rental housing stock. But at the end of the day, it's, you know, a majority of what is owned single family homes that are rented are owned by mom and pop small investors rather than the large institutions. But clearly the large institutions have the buying power. And that's what's being targeted here. What I mean, I guess in some fashion, the president and his administration are going after the high cost of housing, the affordable or the lack of affordability of housing in this country. From your perspective, what's going on there? How do how do we get ourselves here? And maybe how do we fix this situation? Well, I mean, the reason that there's a housing affordability issue is because there hasn't been enough built for an extended period of time. And we've we're undersupplied. And the way to get out of that is to increase supply. And anything that you do from an administrative or regulatory perspective that, you know, caps an incentive to build new supply is is the real problem here for pricing. Right now, rentals are more affordable than buying a home. I think that's pretty well understood across the board. And there's just there's not enough incentive for builders of either single-family or multifamily right now to to increase the housing supply, which really is needed to increase affordability, to improve affordability. So what do the developers, what are they are you going for like other specific remedies or looking for in terms of permitting just regulatory hurdles to build? Yeah, I mean, basically that's that's the key is improved ease of permitting. You know, maybe some private public private partnerships where there's some government input and, you know, tax incentives or things of that nature. Obviously, in markets like New York here, you know, the ability to more easily convert old, old office buildings into rental housing. But, you know, on the single family side, which is what this is really targeting, you know, one of the things that the builders are doing right now is selling their inventory to institutions who will own it and rent it. And that's being targeted. And if you take away that buyer, then, you know, it makes it harder for them to build. If they don't necessarily feel confident, they're going to be able to sell their inventory at the end of the day. Is our building restrictions their local right or not federal? Are they correct that, you know, that the permitting process and the regulations on on housing are at the local level? So, I mean, is this something I mean, are certain states certain areas, is it easier to build, harder to build, I would think in New York City be terribly hard to build something? Yeah. I mean, you can look you can look broad geographic strokes. I mean, that areas in the Sunbelt are, you know, historically much easier to build. Obviously, there's much more land, but also the regulatory environment is easier. And so that's where there's historically been significant, more construction and and the demand has followed. And so, you know, typically supply and demand work on their own. And, you know, the government stays out of it, the federal government stays out of it. And so, you know, at the end of the day, I'm not really sure exactly what's going to be able to be done here. It feels like banning specific owners of properties from playing in a in a private market transaction is is interesting. We'll see. We'll you know, but but clearly he's making life difficult for these companies.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:23:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T17:47:00.371847"}

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nSCARLETT: LET'S SHOW YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE MARKETS. ON THE FACE OF IT THE S & P 500 IS UNCHANGED. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IN THE 11 GROUPS OF THE S & P 500 ONLY TWO SECTORS ARE NOT GAINING. TECH IS DOWN 1.8% AND HEALTH CARE IS MARGINALLY LOWER. YIELDS HAVE BEEN BOUNCED AROUND. RIGHT NOW THE 10 YEAR YIELD IS HIGHER AFTER TODAY'S JOBS DATA WHICH WILL GET INTO IN A LITTLE BIT. I WANTED TO INCLUDE ITA, THE TICKER THAT TRACKS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE. UP .9%. EARLIER IT WAS UP A LOT MORE AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNALED PLANS TO RAMP UP MILITARY SPENDING. OIL REMAINS IN THE SPOTLIGHT, RECOUPING EARLIER DECLINES AS TRADERS CONTINUE TO BALANCE THE NEWS U.S. WILL ASSERT CONTROL OVER VENEZUELA AND DEFINITELY AT A TIME THERE IS PLENTY OF SUPPLY OF OIL. WE WILL DIG INTO ALL OF THAT LATER ON. AS INVESTORS WAIT TOMORROW'S BIG DATA POINT, THE U.S. JOBS REPORT, AND A POTENTIAL MARKET MOVING EVENT OF THE SUPREME COURT RULES ON TARIFFS. WE DID GET AN APPETIZER AND ECONOMIC DATA TODAY. THE TRADE DEFICIT IS SHRINKING TO ITS NARROWEST IN 2009. YOU WOULD US PRODUCTIVITY ACCELERATED TO ITS FASTEST PACE IN THOSE TWO YEARS -- U.S. PRODUCTIVITY ACCELERATED TO ITS FASTEST PLACE IN THOSE TWO YEARS. EARLIER TODAY WE SPOKE WITH FED GOVERNOR STEPHEN MIRAN AND BEGAN BY ASKING HIM IF THE HEAVY NEWS FLOW TO START 2026 HAS CHANGED HIS OUTLOOK ON RATES FOR THE YEAR. > > I AM UNSURPRISINGLY THE LOWEST DOT. I AM LOOKING FOR ABOUT A POINT AND A HALF OF CUTS. ALL THAT IS DRIVEN BY MY VIEW ON INFLATION. MY VIEW IS ALMOST ALL OF THE EXCESS INFLATION OVER TARGET IS DUE TO QUIRKS OF HOW WE CALCULATE INFLATION. SCARLET: TO PROCESS THIS DATA LET'S BRING IN JULIET WHO COVERS U.S. ECONOMY FOR BLOOMBERG. I AM SORRY FOR BUTCHERING YOUR NAME. LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THE DATA POINTS. COMING INTO THIS REPORT JAY POWELL HAS CHARACTERIZED THE REPORT AS LOW HIGHER AND LOW FIRE. JULIANA: IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2025 IT WAS LOW HIGHER OR LOW FIRE. YOU ARE SEEING IT WAS HARD FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE LABOR FORCE TO FIND JOBS. ECONOMISTS WERE LOOKING BECAUSE IN NOVEMBER AND OCTOBER THE CHALLENGERS SHOWED THAT LAYOFF ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE HITTING SOME OF THE HIGHEST IN DECADES. WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS TRANSLATE TO HARD DATA. AS OF YET IT HAS NOT TRANSLATED. INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS HAVE NOT SHIFTED THAT MUCH THERE A LOT OF EYES ON IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WILL TICK UP IN DECEMBER . THERE HAS BEEN A WAIT AND SEE TO THAT. DIFFICULTY WAS BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN A LOT OF FORECASTERS DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE DATA. THEY WERE LOOKING AT PRIVATE REPORTS SUCH AS ADP AND CHALLENGERS TO TRY TO READ THE TEA LEAVES OF THE LABOR MARKET. SCARLET: YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THOSE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF LABOR BECOME MORE IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD EVEN WITH RESUMPTION OF GOVERNMENT DATA? JULIA: ABSOLUTELY. I FEEL THE PRIVATE DATA SOURCES HAVE STEPPED UP IN THIS MOMENT TO TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT. I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE PRIVATE DATA SOURCES AS PART OF THE BROADER PICTURE AS WELL. SCARLET: THE OVERALL LABOR MARKET EVEN AS WE TALK ABOUT LOW HIGHER AND LOW FIRE IS FAIRLY RESILIENT. YOU'VE POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS WERE THAT IS NOT THE CASE, THEY ARE NOT SEEING THE KIND OF LABOR MARKET GAINS. THEY ARE SEEING JOB LOSSES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE. WHAT DOES THAT SHOW? JULIA: THAT SHOWS THAT THESE POCKETS -- THEY ARE SHARING THE CRACKS OF THE LABOR MARKET. ECONOMISTS ARE TRYING TO GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT, EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE JOB GAINS ARE, THEY ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN HEALTH CARE. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SEEING A RESILIENT LABOR MARKET IS ONLY IN THESE DIFFERENT POCKETS AND THAT IS WHY ECONOMISTS ARE SO LASER FOCUS ON WHAT WILL COME BACK TOMORROW. SCARLET: AFTER THIS JOBS REPORT WHAT IS THE NEXT GLIMPSE IN TERMS OF DATA THAT WILL PROVIDE THE FED WITH ANY SENSE OF HOW IT MOVES FORWARD WITH RATE CUTS? JULIA: CPI WILL BE SOMETHING THEY LOOK AFTER. THEY HAVE A DUAL MANDATE WHICH IS INFLATION AND FULL EMPLOYMENT. EVEN THOUGH THE INFLATION NUMBERS WERE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, THAT IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT THING COMING IN NEXT WEEK. SCARLET: EVEN IF THE DATA IS NOT CLEAN IT IS BETTER DATA THAN IT HAD BEEN IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. JULIA COVERING THE ECONOMIC DATA FOR US AT BLOOMBERG. FOR MORE ON HOW POLICYMAKERS ARE DOING THESE ECONOMY, FOLDING IN ON THE DATA AVAILABLE TO THEM, LET'S BRING IN BETSY STEPHENSON, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND A FORMER MEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS AND THE FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. IT IS GREAT TO SPEAK WITH YOU. THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM INTO 2026 WAS A LABOR MARKET WAS SLOWING AND THE SLOW DOWN WOULD INTENSIFY THIS YEAR. THE LATEST DATA COMING OUT SHOWS WE STILL HAVE A FAIRLY LOW FIRE ENVIRONMENT. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? BETSY: WE DO HAVE A LOW FIRE ENVIRONMENT. UNFORTUNATELY YOU ALSO HAVE A LOW HIGHER ENVIRONMENT. WHAT THAT MEANS IS PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF THE LABOR MARKET WILL STRUGGLE TO GET BACK IN. IF YOU LOOK AT DATA WHERE PEOPLE ARE ASKED HOW HARD YOU THINK IT IS TO FIND A JOB, WE ARE SEEING THEY THINK IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND A JOB RIGHT NOW. IF YOU CAN HANG ONTO TO YOUR JOB THINGS ARE GREAT. IF YOU CANNOT HANG ONTO YOUR JOB IT COULD BE DISMAL. I THINK THAT IS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT CREATES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ANXIETY FOR PEOPLE. SCARLET: WE ARE SEEING THAT SHOW UP IN SURVEYS ABOUT SENTIMENT AND CONFIDENCE EVEN IT DOES NOT CARRY INTO SPENDING JUST YET. TECHNICALLY WE ARE FAR FROM A RECESSION. THERE IS GROWTH BUT THERE ARE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS THAT ARE SEEING DETERIORATION AWAY IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH A SOLID ECONOMY WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE GRADUATES OR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN THE LABOR MARKET INTO DISTINCT GROUPS? BETSY: FIRST I WOULD SAY LET'S LOOK AT THE LABOR MARKET IN TERMS OF WHERE THE JOBS ARE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THE LABOR MARKET THAT HAS SETTLED BACK INTO A WEAK LABOR MARKET WHERE MOST OF THE JOB GROWTH IS OCCURRING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH SERVICES SECTOR AND A LITTLE BIT IN THAT LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY. EVERYBODY ELSE IS SLOW. THE JOBS REPORT WE WILL SEE AT THE END OF THIS WEEK, IS INTERESTING TO SEE DID WE ADD JOBS IN IMPORTANT AREA, BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, WHICH IS WHERE A LOT OF HIGH-QUALITY JOBS ARE. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MANUFACTURING WHICH IS BEEN SHEDDING JOBS ALL YEAR DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO BOOST MANUFACTURING. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS A LABOR MARKET WHERE MOST INDUSTRIES ARE PRETTY MUCH FROZEN AND THE GROWTH WE HAVE THAT IS KEEPING US OUT OF RECESSION FROM A LABOR MARKET PERSPECTIVE IS HAPPENING IN A VERY NARROW SLICE OF THE ECONOMY. YOU TURN TO THE STOCK MARKET AND YOU SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR WHICH IS THE GROWTH WE ARE HAVING OCCURRING IN A VERY NARROW SLICE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE IT IS DIFFERENT. IT IS THE AI DRIVEN BOOM HITTING A FEW COMPANIES GENERATING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF GROWTH. IT IS PAPERING OVER THE IDEA THAT A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES ARE NOT LOOKING QUITE AS GREAT. SCARLET: FROM WHERE YOU SIT HOW MUCH OF THE AI STORY -- I'M TALKING ABOUT THE AI COMPLEX, THE SPENDING WITH AI AND THE PLANNING WITH AI AS OPPOSED TO THE USE OF AI TO TAKE AWAY JOBS, HOW MUCH OF THAT IS AFFECTING THE LABOR MARKET OR HAVE WE YET TO SEE THE FULL IMPACT? BETSEY: FOR SURE WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE FULL IMPACT. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE WHICH IS YOU DO NOT LAY ANYBODY OFF BECAUSE YOU START USING AI. YOU MIGHT THINK TWICE ABOUT WHO YOU NEED TO HIRE. THAT IS WHY IT WILL IMPACT THE EARLY YOUNG PEOPLE'S ENTRY INTO THE LABOR MARKET. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A WEEK ECONOMY OR A WEAKENING, IT IS THE VERB, NOT THE LEVEL OF THE ECONOMY ITSELF IS OK. IF WE THINK IT IS WEAKENING AND YOU THINK THERE IS A RISK OF WEAKENING AND YOU ARE A COMPANY THE FIRST THING YOU ALWAYS DO IS CUT BACK ON YOUR HIRING. IF YOU ALSO THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEPLOY AI OPTIONS OR AI TOOLS THAT IS GOING TO WHERE I REALLY DO NOT NEED TO TAKE THE RISK OF BRINGING ON MORE HEADCOUNT IF I WOULD GET THIS HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY OUT OF THE PEOPLE I CURRENTLY HAVE UNLESS I THINK THAT WILL TRANSLATE TO HIGHER SALES. MORE PRODUCTIVITY IS GREAT AS LONG AS IT TRANSLATES TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT IS JUST AN EXCUSE FOR EMPLOYERS TO CUT BACK ON HIRING. SCARLET: COMPANIES ARE IN THIS MOMENT OF TRANSITION GETTING READY FOR THE FULL IMPACT OF AI. HOW DO POLICYMAKERS FOLD THAT IN. POLICYMAKERS AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE VERSUS POLICYMAKERS IN GOVERNMENT, THOSE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE FISCAL POLICY? BETSEY: FROM A MONETARY POLICY PERSPECTIVE SOME OF IT IS THE SAME WHICH IS THEY NEED TO BE PURSUING THEIR DUAL MANDATE AND SAYING WHAT CAN THEY DO TO MAKE SURE THE LABOR MARKET IS AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE. THEY HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT CREATING HIGH PRESSURE. AI SHOULD MAKE IT SO WE CAN BRUISE A LOT MORE STUFF. ONE WAY YOU HAVE TO FOLD IT IN HIS HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH EXPECTATIONS IN THE LONG RUN. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT AND FRANKLY WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FORECASTS WE ARE SEEING OUT OF THE FOMC TO SEE WHAT ARE WE STARTING TO BREAK IN THAT HIGHER GROWTH WE MIGHT EXPECT FROM AI. FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE THERE IS A LOT TO DO, PROBABLY MORE THAN WE CAN DISCUSS. WE WILL NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT WHO WILL BE THE IMMEDIATE WINNERS FROM AI AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE ALL OF SOCIETY BENEFITS. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS CHANGE AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ELEVATE ALL OF HUMANITY. EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALL OF HUMANITY. IT WILL TAKE POLICY TO MAKE SURE ALL OF HUMANITY IS ELEVATED AS OPPOSED TO DESTROYED. IF YOU SPEND TIME WITH THE TECH GUYS AND GALS WHO WORK ON AI THERE IS A LOT OF RISK AS WELL IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. SCARLET: ARE YOU ENCOURAGED BITING SIGNS FROM POLICYMAKERS THEY ARE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY? YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF THAT? BETSEY: I DON'T. I WISH I DID. THERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF POLICYMAKERS THINKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL AMERICANS GET THEIR SHARE. AI IS BUILT ON ALL OF OUR DATA. WE SHOULD BE HAVING REAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT IS THE SHARE, WHAT ARE THE RETURNS PEOPLE SHOULD BE GETTING FROM THE FACT THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE BUILDING THEIR FOUNDATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS, EVERY PERSON AROUND THE GLOBE IS MADE FOR CENTURIES. SCARLET: THAT IS A BIGGER DISCUSSION. ALWAYS A PLEASURE SPEAKING WITH YOU. BETSEY STEVENSON, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. LET'S STEER AWAY FROM MACRO ECONOMICS AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EQUITIES AND CHECK OUT A COUPLE INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MOVERS AND BRING IN OUR MARKETS CORRESPONDENT NORAH MULINDA FOR A LOOK AT THAT. NORAH: WE HAVE SEEN ALPHABET SURPASS APPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2019. WE HAVE NVIDIA AS THE TOP STOCK BUT WE HAVE SEEN ALPHABET SHARES SLOTTED IN IS THE SECOND BIGGEST STOCK RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKET. LET'S MOVE FROM THE TECH SPACE INTO THE FED. WE HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF COMMENTARY FROM DONALD TRUMP ON TRUTH SOCIAL. I'VE MY EYES ON LOCKHEED MARTIN. WE PLAN TO INCREASE THE U.S. MILITARY SPENDING BUDGET TO $1.5 TRILLION, A 50% INCREASE BY 2027. WE ARE SEEING THE MARKET CONTINUE TO DIGEST THIS. DID SEE A SLUMP FOR A LOT OF THESE NAMES BECAUSE SOME OF HIS PLANS COULD THREATEN TO CUT OUT SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT PLAN TO BENEFIT IN TERMS OF THE PROFIT BOOST. YOU ARE SEEING THE MARKET STILL DISSECT THIS BUT WE ARE SEEING A REBOUND ON THE DAY. LET'S END THINGS WITH THE HOUSING MARKET. SHARES OF HOMES REBOUNDING AFTER A SLUMP THAT TOOK IT TOWARDS HIS BIGGEST DROP IN SIX MONTHS. WE ARE SEEING SHARES UP .9% WHEN WE LOOK AT INVITATION HOMES AS WELL AS AMERICAN HOMES AFTER DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE PLANS TO CRACK DOWN ON INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SNATCHING UP A LOT OF THE U.S. HOMES. THAT IS ALL WE HAVE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. SCARLET: BLOOMBERG'S MARKETS CORRESPONDENT NORAH MULINDA AND WE WILL STAY ON THAT BECAUSE COMING UP WE LOOK AT HOW REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD VIEW THIS PROPOSAL TO BAN INVESTORS FROM BUYING INDIVIDUAL HOMES. JONATHAN MILLER JOINS US NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: THIS IS BLOOMBERG MARKETS. I'M SCARLET FU. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO BAN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FROM BUYING SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES. HE SAYS HOUSING SHOULD BE FOR PEOPLE AND CORPORATIONS. HIS PROPOSAL SPARKED MARKET REACTION ON HOMEBUILDER STOCKS AND LANDLORDS OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES. LET'S BRING IN JONATHAN MILLER, PRESIDENT AND COFOUNDER OF THE REAL ESTATE APPRAISAL AND CONSULTING FIRM MILLER SAMUEL. YOU AND OTHER EXPERTS HAVE MADE THE POINT THAT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE NOT A BIG PLAYER IN THE SINGLE-FAMILY RENTAL MARKET. YET THEY MAKE FOR A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT. WHY IS THAT. JONATHAN: THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN THE PUBLIC EYE, VERY VISIBLE. THEY ONLY ACCOUNT FOR 1% OF THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING STOCK. BANNING THEM FROM PURCHASING, PERCEPTION WITH THE PUBLIC IS THEY DOMINATE INVENTORY, THEY BASICALLY, ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF HOUSING AND WHY WE ARE IN AN AND PORTABILITY CRISIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS BEEN IN ADEQUATE SUPPLY. THERE ARE VERY TINY, A 1% NUMBER. ON TOP OF IT THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IS IN THE SOUTH, WHICH HAS EXCESS SUPPLY. I AM HAVING A HARD TIME CONNECTING THE DOTS ON HOW THIS WILL HELP IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. I THINK IT IS A NON-ISSUE FOR SOLVING THAT PROBLEM. SCARLET: YOU MAKE A LOT OF IMPORTANT POINTS. HOUSING SUPPLY IS VERY LOCAL. WHEN IT COMES TO PERCEPTIONS THERE IS THE SENSE THESE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND WALL STREET FIRMS LIKE A BLACKSTONE PLAY THIS OUTSIZED ROLE IN PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY CAME IN DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OR IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND DID SWOOP IN AND BUY A LOT OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES AT A TIME WHEN AMERICANS WERE LOSING THEIR HOMES. THAT LOOMS LARGE IN THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS. SCARLET: -- JONATHAN: ABSOLUTELY. PERCEPTION IS VALUE. THEY WERE HIGHLY VISIBLE COMING IN AND SCOOPING UP 2012-2013, A TREMENDOUS VOLUME OF FORECLOSED HOMES AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND HAVE MADE IT WORK. SOME OF THE FIRMS HAVE SOLD OFF PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIOS AS THE MARKET HAS PEAKED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I SEE THIS AS DISCONNECTED FROM WHAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IS. THE PROBLEM IS TO ENHANCE AFFORDABILITY AND I DON'T THINK THE INSTITUTIONAL ASPECT OF THE HOUSING MARKET HAS MUCH TO DO WITH IT. SCARLET: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SUGGESTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. ELIZABETH WARREN HAS ALSO SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT THIS IS A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO TRYING TO TACKLE AFFORDABILITY IN THE HOUSING MARKET. THAT TAKES A LONG TIME. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OVERNIGHT. JONATHAN: AND ALSO A LOT OF THE HOUSING WE ARE BUILDING IS QUEUING TO THE HIGHER END BECAUSE OF LAND COSTS AND PRODUCT COSTS AND LABOR COSTS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS MAKE IT DIFFICULT. IF YOU CREATE OVERSUPPLY OR MODEST OVERSUPPLY. IF YOU CREATE OVERSUPPLY IT MELTS INTO HOUSING PRICES. IT IS NOT A SUREFIRE SOLUTION BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. THE OTHER THING IS A LOT OF THE CHALLENGE OF SINGLE-FAMILY AFFORDABILITY HAS BEEN ZONING IN CITIES LIKE MINNEAPOLIS HAVE BANNED THE SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING, NEW CONSTRUCTION WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY AND TRYING TO MOVE TOWARDS MULTI FAMILY AND HIGH DENSITY AREAS. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. HE REPORTED THAT BOTH SIDES OF THE ISLE ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IN THAT INVENTORY IS VERY LOCAL AND VERY REGIONAL. WHEN WE LOOK AT MARKETS LIKE THE NORTHEAST OR THE MIDWEST, VERY TIGHT IN TERMS OF SUPPLY. WE LOOK AT THE SUNBELT, VERY SOFT BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING DURING THE MIGRATION PATTERN WE SAW DURING COVID WHERE PEOPLE LEFT THE NORTHEAST AND THE WEST COAST TO GO TO MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT SOON ENDED BECAUSE THE DEMAND WAS SO HIGH. YOU HAVE REMEMBER THAT MORTGAGE RATES ARE DOUBLE WHAT THEY WERE AND STILL HOUSING PRICES ARE RISING. IT IS ALL ABOUT SUPPLY. SCARLET: IT ALL COMES DOWN TO SUPPLY. JONATHAN MILLER. SUPPLY IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. COMING UP CHINA MAY REOPEN THE DOOR TO BUYING NVIDIA CHIPS. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT. SCARLET: WE HAVE A MIXED STOCK MARKET WITH TECH SHARES DRIED LOWER BY NVIDIA EVEN AS BLOOMBERG SHOWS CHINA PLANS TO IMPORT SOME NVIDIA CHIPS AS SOON AS THIS QUARTER. CAROLINE HYDE JUNE SAYS -- CAROLINE HYDE JOINS US FROM LAS VEGAS. THIS IS SOMETHING NVIDIA INVESTORS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. CAROLINE: THEY ARE AND MAYBE ALREADY PRICED IN IN THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SEEING THE STOCK MARKET ALREADY REACT. THERE ARE A LOT OF HIGH HOPES AS TO HOW MUCH THIS MARKET CAN BE FOR NVIDIA. $50 BILLION IS WHAT THEY ARE PERCEIVED IN TERMS OF DEMAND AND ALREADY YOU HAVE JENSEN HUANG TAKE TO THE STAGE SAYING WE ARE ABLE, IF THE H200'S, IF WE ARE ABLE TO GET THE LICENSES AND IF CHINA WANTS THEM WE ARE SEEING STRONG DEMAND. THERE IS ALREADY REPORTING THAT SOME 2000 CHIPS ARE WANTED BY BYD AND ALIBABA. THAT WILL BOOST THE REVENUE. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT HAD 95% MARKET SHARE IN CHINA WHEN IT CAME TO CHIPS. IT NOW HAS 0% UNLESS ALLOWED TO ACCESS EVER SINCE IT WAS CURTAILED FROM THAT MARKET UNLESS -- IN 2022. IF THEY DO GET THE LICENSE THEY WANT TO SHARE SOME THE REVENUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND IF THIS IS ALLOWED IN THE CHINESE ALLOWED FOR THEIR COMPANIES, NOT FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT ALSO FOR THE MILITARY AND ENTERPRISES RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS. IT WILL BE A BIG BOOM IN TERMS OF REVENUE FOR NVIDIA. IT IS INTERESTING THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT REACTING THE WAY YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE. SCARLET: WHAT ABOUT CHINA'S OWN CHIPMAKERS? BEIJING WAS TRYING TO GIVE THEM TIME TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN ADVANCED AI CHIPS. ARE THEY DOING WITH THAT MUCH OF MARK CAROLINE: PHENOMENALLY WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR STOCK PRICES. THERE IS A NEW STAR PLAYER WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORLD OF CHIPS. WHILE WEIGHT BEEN MAKING INROADS. -- HUAWEI HAS BEEN MAKING INROADS. MANY WOULD SAY WE ARE'S FOR -- WE ARE -- HOW SOPHISTICATED CHINA IS. WE JUST HAD JACOB HELBERG ON THE SHOW, HE IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ABOUT THE RESILIENCY AND NATIONAL SECURITY EFFORTS OF MAKING SURE CHIPS ARE MADE IN THE U.S. WERE MADE BY ALLIED PARTNERS. HE SAYS FROM A MARKET SHARE PERSPECTIVE MAYBE YOU DO WANT NVIDIA TO ACCESS CHINA. SCARLET: CAROLINE HYDE, APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. CAROLINE HYDE REPORTING FROM THE FLOOR OF CES IN LAS VEGAS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: WELCOME TO \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" WE HAVE A STOCK MARKET THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE S & P 500 UNCHANGED. TACK IS DOWN ON THE DAY. CONSUMER STAPLES ARE HIGHER. TREASURY YIELDS ARE MOVING SLIGHTLY HIGHER. JOBS DATA SHOW THE LABOR MARKET IS HOLDING UP BETTER THAN FEARED. THAT IS IN THE LEAD UP TO TOMORROW'S MONTHLY JOBS REPORT AT 8:30 A.M. DEFENSE COMPANIES ARE MOVING HIGHER ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SIGNALING TO RAMP UP MILITARY SPENDING. CRUDE OIL UP BY MORE THAN 2%. THERE'S A LOT OF NEWS OUT THERE THAT INCLUDES THE U.S. EXERTING CONTROL OVER VENEZUELAN OIL AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS PLENTY OF SUPPLY. LET'S STICK WITH EQUITIES AND TURN TO NORAH MULINDA FOR INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MOVERS. NORAH: THE SAGA BETWEEN WARNER BROS., PARAMOUNT AND NETFLIX. PARAMOUNT CAME OUT REAFFIRMING ITS OFFER FOR WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY IN CASH. $30 PER SHARE. WE SEE THEM UNDERSCORING THEIR BID DESPITE THE FACT THEY RECEIVED MULTIPLE REJECTIONS. THEY ARE ARGUING IT IS STILL SUPERIOR TO THE COMPETITOR, NETFLIX. WE HAVE OUR EYES ON ROBOTAXIS AND A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AT THE INTERSECTION OF TECHNOLOGY. FORWARD HINTING AT THE FACT IT COULD BE UNVEILING OR ENTERING THE ROBOTAXI SPACE. SHARES UP BY MORE THAN 5% AS INVESTORS DIGEST THAT NEWS. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND VENEZUELA. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE ENERGY SECRETARY THAT U.S. OIL COMPANIES ARE HOPING TO EXAMINE WHAT ROLE THEY CAN PLAY IN TERMS OF REVITALIZING THE VENEZUELAN ENERGY SECTOR. LOOK AT CHEVRON UP ABOUT 1.7% AFTER THE ENERGY SAID THIS COMPANY COULD RAMP UP QUICKLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ACTIVITY AND VENEZUELA AND THE OIL SECTOR MORE BROADLY. EXXON AND CONOCOPHILLIPS IN FOCUS AS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT BEING INTERESTED IN THIS DEVELOPMENT. ALL SHARES ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE GREEN. SCARLET: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. TURNING TO A STORY AT CROSSING THE TERMINAL, THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERING A BIPARTISAN SLATE OF NOMINATIONS FOR THE CFTC. THAT'S ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR. THAT WOULD MEAN THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC PIC FOR A MAJOR WALL STREET REGULATOR IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. LYDIA HELPED BREAK THE STORY FOR BLOOMBERG. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING OF PULLING -- PUTTING FORWARD DEMOCRATIC NOMINEES FOR THIS REGULATOR? LYDIA: IT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT IN THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AT ANY INDEPENDENT AGENCY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. THE SEC IS DOWN TO JUST THREE REPUBLICANS, NO DEMOCRATS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AS WELL. WE KNOW AT LEAST THE CFTC SEEMS TO BE THE INITIAL PRIORITY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN DECIDING WHETHER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A BIPARTISAN SLATE. SCARLET: ONE REASON IS BECAUSE THE CFTC, EVEN THOUGH IT REGULATES THE DERIVATIVES AND SWAPS MARKET, IT IS TAKING ON A LARGER ROLE. IT IS CONTENDING WITH CRYPTO AND PREDICTION MARKETS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN BOOMING GROWTH WITH POLYMARKET PICKING UP A LOT OF ATTENTION. TALK ABOUT THE REMIT OF THE CFTC RIGHT NOW GIVEN IT IS SO UNDERSTAFFED. LYDIA: YOU ARE RIGHT. THEY ONLY HAVE ONE COMMISSIONER, THE NEW CHAIRMAN MICHAEL SELIG. THEY ARE VERY BUSY. PREDICTION MARKETS HAVE TAKEN OVER AT THE AGENCY. WITH CONGRESS DEBATING WHETHER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE, LEGISLATION THAT COULD GIVE MORE AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE THE DIGITAL ASSET MARKET. THIS BIPARTISAN SLATE UNDER CONSIDERATION PLAYS INTO THAT. DEMOCRATS HAVE ASKED FOR A QUORUM REQUIREMENT AT BOTH AGENCIES TO BE PUT IN PLACE SO THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE MEMBERS OF MINORITY PARTY IN THE FUTURE. THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE MY MARK -- MINORITY MEMBERS FOR ANY ACTION AND THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT IF THE BILL PASSES AND THE AGENCIES GET MORE CRYPTO AUTHORITY. SCARLET: THE CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE LEGISLATION IS SOMETHING WE ARE STILL AWAITING. COULD IT GET DONE BEFORE A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IS INSTALLED ON THE CFTC? WOULDN'T LIKELY BE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME? LYDIA: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND COMES DOWN TO IF THE WHITE HOUSE DECIDES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH BIPARTISAN NOMINEES AT ALL. WE ARE EXPECTING A MARKUP IN THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE ON THEIR VERSION OF THE BILL NEXT WEEK. A WEEK FROM TODAY. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT, IF THE MARKUP IS SUCCESSFUL TO GET THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE, WE WILL SEE. TYPICALLY THE NOMINEES TAKE MANY MONTHS TO COME THROUGH THE WHOLE CONFIRMATION PROCESS ONCE THEY ARE EVEN OUT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS HARD TO SAY WHERE -- WHETHER THOSE TRACKS WILL ALIGN AT ALL. SCARLET: LYDIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ON PERHAPS THE WHITE HOUSE IS CONSIDERING A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR THE CFTC. AS A PROMISE, DEFENSE STOCKS LIKE LOCKHEED MARTIN ARE JUMPING IN THE SESSION AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS FOR A MASSIVE INCREASE IN THE U.S.'S MILITARY BUDGET. UP NEXT, THE STOCKS OF THE HOUR. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: IT IS TIME FOR OUR STOCK OF THE HOUR. DEFENSE STOCKS ARE RISING UP TO THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS TO INCREASE THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY BUDGET BY 50% TO ONE POINT $5 TRILLION IN 2027. LET'S BRING IN AEROSPACE DEFENSE AND AIRLINE ANALYST GEORGE FERGUSON. WE ARE SEEING NAMES LIKE LOCKHEED MARTIN TAKE OFF ON THIS VAGUE ANNOUNCEMENT. A 50% JUMP IN THE BUDGET SOUNDS HUGE. $1.5 TRILLION. IS THAT SOMETHING THE INDUSTRY COULD SPEND? GEORGE: IT WILL BE DIFFICULT. IT'S A 50% JUMP OVER THE $1 TRILLION WE SAW UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. EVEN IF YOU GET A COUPLE OF YEARS PRIOR TO THAT BACK DURING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, 800 TO 900. THAT'S A CONSIDERABLE JUMP IN THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS. THIS IS A HEAVY INDUSTRY BUSINESS. THE EQUIPMENT YOU BUY FOR THE MILITARY HAS LONG LEAD TIME ITEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO MOVE THROUGH PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY THAT ARE CONSTRICTED. THERE MIGHT BE FORGINGS AND CASTINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU COULD TRY TO SPEND 1.5 BILLION A YEAR AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SUPER INEFFICIENT. I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DO ON THE U.S. BUDGET AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO TRY TO EVEN OUT AN INCREASE OVER TIME THEN MAKE IT LUMPY RISE AND FALL. SCARLET: I GET THE SENSE PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT BE PATIENT, WANT TO SEE MOVIE -- SEE SOMETHING MOVING MORE QUICKLY. DO WE PRESUME THIS WOULD BE SPENT ON U.S. MANUFACTURERS? COULD SOME GO TO EUROPEAN MANUFACTURERS? GEORGE: U.S. LAW SAYS IT IS HARD TO BE BUILDING THIS STUFF OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. SOME EUROPEAN COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE U.S. DEFENSE INDUSTRY BUT THEY TYPICALLY BUILD HERE IN THE U.S. AND TYPICALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT U.S. MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT TO DO IT. I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO IT THROUGH THE EXISTING FOOTPRINT HERE. EUROPE IS BUSY WRAPPING UP DEFENSE SPENDING THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE INCREASES AS WELL IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IT IS NOT LIKE THEIR INDUSTRY IS NOT BUSY TRYING TO EXPAND VERY QUICKLY AS WELL AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME LIMITATIONS WE DO. SCARLET: GEORGE, APPRECIATE YOU SPEAKING WITH US ABOUT THIS. GEORGE FERGUSON OF BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE. COMING UP, THE CO-CREATORS OF HBO'S \"INDUSTRY\" DISCUSS WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR ENTERTAINMENT OVER ALL IN 2026. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: I'M SCARLET FU AND THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" PARAMOUNT REAFFIRMING IS OFFER FOR PARAMOUNT -- WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY FOR $30 A SHARE. THIS COMES UP TO AGAIN REJECTED PARAMOUNT'S OFFER YESTERDAY. LET'S BRING IN MICHELLE DAVIS FOR MORE. IT FEELS LIKE EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR PARAMOUNT TO RAISE THE BID BUT IT IS NOT DOING THAT. WHY NOT? MICHELLE: THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION. THINGS ARE AT AN IMPASSE HERE. HERE MATT HAS ESSENTIALLY BROUGHT THE SAME OFFER NOW 3, 4 TIMES TO WARNER BROS. WARNER BROS. HAS REJECTED THE SAME OFFER. IN PARAMOUNT'S MOST RECENT OFFER, THEY DID OFFER TO BACKSTOP THE EQUITY. ELLISON BACKSTOPPED THE EQUITY. WARNER BROS. SAID THERE WAS A GREAT MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THERE ARE ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES WITH THE OFFER. IT IS RISKY. THE BIGGEST OF ALL TIME. THERE'S A LOT OF DEBT COMING OUT OF IT. IT DOES NOT OFFER A LOT OF VALUE. WHY ARE THEY TALKING PAST EACH OTHER? PARAMOUNT SAID WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING. WE CATERED TO WARNER BROS. AND WARNER BROS. IS NOT ENGAGING. WARNER BROS. SAID WE TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. THERE SEEMS TO BE MISCOMMUNICATION. SCARLET: IT FEELS LIKE PARAMOUNT IS NOT HELPING ITSELF. IN THE LATEST REAFFIRMATION THEY ACTUALLY SAID THE CABLE CHANNELS THEY ARE ALSO INCLUDING IN THEIR OFFER IS WORTH NOTHING, WHICH IS KIND OF CURIOUS. WHY DO THEY WANT THAT? MICHELLE: IT DOES BENEFIT THEM TO SAY THE CABLE NETWORKS ARE WORTH NOTHING BECAUSE THEIR OFFER IS TECHNICALLY WORTH MORE THAN NETFLIX'S BECAUSE NETFLIX'S WOULD BE -- IT'S AN INTERESTING TACTIC. I WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE. IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS WAIT FOR NETFLIX'S STOCK PRICE TO KEEP DECLINING AND REGULATORS TO SAY WE DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD DEAL AND MAYBE WAIT FOR NETFLIX OR WARNER BROS. TO GET COLD FEET AND THEN BECOME MORE AMENABLE TO THE DEAL, OR WAIT FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO PRESSURE THE OFFER. SCARLET: HOW HAVE SHAREHOLDERS RESPONDED SO FAR? THIS IS A HOSTILE BID. HAVE THEY TENDERED THEIR OFFERS? MICHELLE: PARAMOUNT PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SAYING ABOUT 1% OF SHAREHOLDERS HAD TENDERED THEIR SHARES. NOT VERY MANY AT ALL. OFTEN IN THESE SITUATIONS, PEOPLE WAIT UNTIL THE END TO REALLY TENDER. THAT COULD BE PART OF WHAT IS HOLDING THINGS UP. PARAMOUNT EXTENDED THE TENDER OFFICE TO JANUARY 21. THERE IS MORE TIME FOR THEM TO MAKE THE ROUNDS OF INVESTORS AND CONVINCED SOME THAT THEY SHOULD GO THIS WAY. SO FAR WE HAVE HEARD SOME SUPPORT, SOME SHAREHOLDERS. THERE WAS A LETTER SENT TO WARNER BROS. THAT SAID WE WANT YOU TO ENGAGE, WHY AREN'T YOU? OTHERS SAY WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT IF PARAMOUNT DOES NOT RAISE THE BID? SCARLET: WHAT WILL MOVE THE SAGA ALONG? MICHELLE: THERE IS A SHAREHOLDER VOTE AND THINGS NOT NECESSARILY SCHEDULED BUT WE ARE WAITING FOR. MAYBE PARAMOUNT WILL RAISE THE BID OR WE WILL GET SOME SIGNALS OUT OF REGULATORS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE FEELING ABOUT THE EXISTING DEAL ON THE TABLE OR THE PARAMOUNT DEAL. MAYBE PARAMOUNT WILL AMEND THE OFFER. THERE IS A LOT THAT COULD HAPPEN. THE ONE TRUE CATALYST IS THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE. SCARLET: NETFLIX HAS NOT SAID ANYTHING. MICHELLE: THEY APPLAUDED THE WARNER BROS. BOARD FOR REAFFIRMING THEIR EXISTING DEAL AND FOR SEEING THE RECENT OFFER WAS NOT AS EQUAL FOOTING TO THE HE -- TO THERE'S. -- THEIRS. SCARLET: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING US UP-TO-DATE ON THIS BIDDING WAR. WHETHER IT INCLUDES THE CABLE CHANNELS WERE NOT IS UP TO CONTENTION. ONE OF THE WARNER BROS. ASSETS IS HBO. SUNDAY NIGHT IS SHORTHAND FOR PRESTIGE TV. SHOWS LIKE THE SOPRANOS, GAME OF THRONES, SUCCESSION, WHITE LOTUS. THIS SUNDAY MEANS THE SEASON 4 PREMIERE OF INDUSTRY ABOUT INTERNATIONAL FINANCE SET IN LONDON. I SAT DOWN WITH THE SHOW RUNNERS FOR THEIR FIRST TV INTERVIEW AHEAD OF THE SUNDAY PREMIERE. > > SEASON ON SEASON, WE TRY TO EXPAND THE HORIZON OF THE SHOW AND BROADEN THE THEMES. WE REALIZE IN SEASON THREE WE WERE NOT JUST WRITING ABOUT FINANCE. WE WERE WRITING ABOUT INTERSECTIONS OF MEDIA, POLITICS, FINANCE, THE QUID PRO QUO AND THE BACKSCRATCHING AND WE WANTED TO MAKE THE SHOW SLIGHTLY MORE UNIVERSAL. THEY'RE STILL OF REAL FINANCIAL THRILLER ENGINE BUT IT HAS A WIDER SCOPE. SCARLET: THIS SHOWS ABOUT PEOPLE WORKING. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE SO COMPELLED BY SHOWS ABOUT PEOPLE WORKING. > > PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED BY CHARACTERS THAT ARE COMPETENT. THE PHARISEES WAS REALLY ABOUT INCOMPETENCE IN SOME WAYS -- THE FIRST SEASON WAS REALLY ABOUT INCOMPETENCE IN SOME WAYS. BECOMING THE MASTER OF THEIR OWN UNIVERSE IS SATISFYING AN INTERESTING. SEEING SMART PEOPLE BEHAVE SMARTLY IN A WORKING ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY ARE NOT USED TO. PEOPLE LIKE WORKING IN A BLACK BOX AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR THE INDUSTRY. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE SEEING UNDER THE HOOD A LITTLE BIT. > > THE PIT IS COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT. THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF INDUSTRY. THE POLITICS OF AIR I -- ARE VERY DIFFERENT BUT EXPERTS DOING EXPERT THINGS VERY QUICKLY ENGAGES YOUR BRAIN SOMEHOW. SCARLET: THE HYPER CONFIDENCE AND THE VELOCITY OF IT. YOU RELY ON CONSULTANTS TO HELP YOU GET THERE. IN THE FIRST SEASON YOU HAD WALL STREET GUYS HELPING YOU WITH JARGON. YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE HE USED TO WORK ON GLOBAL WALL STREET YOURSELVES. HOW HAS THAT EVOLVED AS YOUR SHOW HAS EMBRACED BIGGER WORLDS LIKE POLITICS AND MEDIA? > > THIS SHOW IS A REFLECTION OF WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN AT THE TIME AND IT'S A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SHOW. IT IS NOT DEALING WITH THE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD. WE RELY ON GOOD CONSULTANTS. WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE IN FINANCE AND PEOPLE THAT WORK IN POLITICS. THE SHOW HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR AND PEOPLE ARE GRAVITATING TOWARDS IT MORE. PEOPLE WANT TO WORK ON IT. SOMETIMES THEY ARE QUITE WELL-KNOWN, INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE WHO WANT THEIR NAMES ALL FIT BUT THEY ARE HELPFUL. > > REALITY IS A FORM OF FICTION. IF YOU TALK TO THEM FOR 10 MINUTES, SOME OF THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE WAY THEY LOOK AT THE THINGS WE ARE WRITING ABOUT IS FAR MORE INTERESTING AND FAR MORE DRAMATIC THAN THE STUFF YOU CAN JUST COOK UP THINKING ABOUT IT. SCARLET: YOU INTRODUCED NEW CHARACTERS THIS SEASON. THEY ALL PLAY AMERICANS ON THE SHOW WHICH I NOTICED IS INTERESTING EVEN THOUGH MAX'S ENGLISH. WHY DO YOU PUT A FOCUS ON AMERICANS IN LONDON? FOR PURELY COMMERCIAL REASONS? > > THAT IS PART OF IT. THE SHOW STARTED AS AN EXPLORATION OF OUTSIDERS COMING INTO THE INSIDE WORLD. IT WAS ENCAPSULATED BY A BLACK AMERICAN WOMAN COMING TO THE WHITE BRITISH CLASS THE SYSTEM. -- BASE SYSTEM. IT IS ULTIMATELY AN AMERICAN SHOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS WRITTEN BY TWO BRITS. FINANCE IS A GLOBAL THING. THERE ARE LOADS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WORKING IN IT AND IT FEELS LIKE THAT MISHMASH OF CULTURES HAS BECOME A SETTING POINT OF THE SHOW IN SOME WAYS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ANYONE IS SAYING. SCARLET: HOW DO YOU GET AROUND THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF JARGON AND ACCENTS AND THE SPEED AND VELOCITY AT WHICH YOU ARE MOVING? > > WE DON'T REALLY GET AROUND IT. ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SHOW AS THEY FIND IT SLIGHTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE. I THINK WE MADE IT SLIGHTLY MORE UNIVERSAL AND EASIER TO FOLLOW. I BELIEVE TURNING TO CLOSED CAPTIONING ON ALLOWS YOU TO FIND THE FINER BITS OF DIALOGUE. SCARLET: I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO THAT. I WONDER HOW MUCH REAL WORLD EVENTS ARE FOLDED INTO THE SHOW. IT IS NOT A DIRECT COMMENTARY OF 2025 WHEN YOU FILMED IN 2024. IT FEELS LIKE THE MOVE AWAY FROM DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A CAST THAT IS DIVERSE IS SOMETHING REFLECTED IN THE CONTENT OF THE SHOW. > > I THINK IT REFLECTS THE SPIRIT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT. IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH THE WORLD WILL BE LIKE IN A YEAR. IT IS SET IN 2026. WE ARE QUITE PRESCIENT SOMETIMES WHEN WE WRITE ABOUT ONLINE SAFETY VERIFICATION AND AROUND THE U.K. IT'S BECOME A BIG THING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. WE TRIED TO REFLECT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REAL WORLD. WE ARE INTERESTED IN POLITICS AND ENTERTAINMENT AND FINANCE. WE TRY TO INJECT THAT INTO WHAT WE DO. > > IT IS NOT LIKE JOURNALISTICALLY RIGOROUS LIKE A WIRE. IT IS SOAPIER THAN THAT. IT'S A HIGH EMOTIONAL SHOW. WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME WORKING ON IT WE CAN'T HELP IT RIGHT BUT WE ARE INTERESTED IN. WE HAVE TO FIND THINGS. THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT INEVITABLY WINDS UP ON THE SHOW. SCARLET: YOU ARE PLANNING FOR SEASON FIVE. WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO SEASON ONE AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE PITCHING A SHOW LIKE THIS TO HBO, HOW HAS THE INDUSTRY CHANGED OVERALL IN TERMS OF HOW YOU THINK YOU CAN GET A SHOW LIKE THIS ON THE AIR NOW? > > THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED TO US ARE VERY DIFFERENT NOW. THE SHOW IS NOT IP DRIVEN. IT'S ORIGINAL CONTENT BY TWO PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING BEFORE. HBO, WHICH IS A BRILLIANT NETWORK, TOOK A CHANCE ON US. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE SAME WAY. PEOPLE ARE GRAVITATING TOWARDS THINGS THEY UNDERSTAND AND HAVE BUILT-IN FAN BASES. THE FACT WE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO EVOLVE THE SHOW EVERY SEASON AND CHANGE THE SHOW PRETTY MUCH FROM THE SLICE OF LIKE YOUNG PERSON SHOW THAT IT WAS TO A CORPORATE FINANCIAL THOROUGHL -- THRILLER IS TESTAMENT TO THE FACT PEOPLE ARE TAKING CHANCES. THERE ARE FEWER CASES OF THAT. SCARLET: THE LAST THING IS THAT SEASON FOUR IS ROLLING OUT WHEN HBO'S PARENT COMPANY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIDDING WAR THAT COULD MAKE A WHERE THE SUNDAY NIGHT TV SERIES OF ITS OWN. WERE YOU EVER ATTEMPTED TO DRAW PARALLELS OR BRING IN THAT KIND OF TENSION INTO YOUR STORYTELLING? > > HBO MADE A SUCCESSFUL SHOW ABOUT THAT ARE READY AND HAS A CABINET FULL OF E-MINIS -- EMMIY'S. IT'S ABOUT TRANSFERS OF POWER. WHO SAYS WE WON'T SEE SOME OF THAT IN SEASON FIVE? DO MIGHT BE SAFER NOT TO. SCARLET: OUR THANKS TO THE CO-CREATORS AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS OF HBO'S \"INDUSTRY.\" THE SEASON FOUR PREMIERE IS SUNDAY NIGHT. LET'S JUST SHOW YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MARKETS. WE HAVE A DIRECTION FOR THE STOCK MARKET. THE S & P 500 IS HIGHER, UP BY .1% AFTER EARLIER DECLINING. YOU ARE SEEING SOME GAINS IN DEFENSE COMPANIES. THERE IS THE ETF THAT TRACKS DEFENSE SHARES UP 5.8% AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO INCREASE MILITARY SPENDING. YIELDS ARE MOVING HIGHER BEFORE THE BIG JOBS REPORT TOMORROW. 10-YEAR YIELD UP TWO BASIS POINTS. THE DECEMBER JOBS REPORT COMING OUT AT 8:30 A.M. THE ECONOMISTS ARE PREDICTING AN INCREASE OF 70,000 FOR THE HEADLINE NUMBER. IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING PAYROLLS, THAT IS CONTINUING TO SEE A DECLINE. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES WE ARE LOOKING FOR A 5000 DROP IN MANUFACTURING PAYROLLS. NEW YORK CRUDE OIL UP BY 2.2%. A LOT OF NEWS FLOW PUSHING OIL AROUND. IT CONTINUES TO HOLD NERO FIVE-YEAR LOW. WE WILL HAND YOU OFF THE BALANCE OF POWER. A LOT TO DISCUSS AS THERE IS MORE JOB STATED THE COME OUT FOLLOWING A STREAM OF PRIVATE DATA JOBS REPORTS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

Lydia Beyoud discusses with Scarlet Fu on \"Bloomberg Markets.\" (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nLydia, thanks for speaking with us. How significant is this that the Trump administration is thinking of putting forward some Democratic nominees for this regulator? Well, it would be really significant. It could be the very first Democratic nominees at an end of any independent agency in this administration. The SEC is also down to just three Republicans. There are no Democrats since the beginning of this year as well. But what we know is that the at least the CFTC seems to be the sort of initial priority for the White House in deciding whether to move forward with a bipartisan slate. And one reason, perhaps that it might be a priority is the CFTC, even though traditionally it regulates the derivatives and swaps market, it's taken on a larger role. It's now contending with crypto and as well prediction markets where we've seen booming growth with cash and poorly market picking up a lot of attention. Talk to us a little bit about, you know, the remit of the CFTC right now, given that it's so understaffed. You're right, Scarlett. The CFTC only has one commissioner that's the the new chairman, Michael Selig, and they are already very busy. Prediction markets have really taken over at that agency. And then with Congress debating whether to move forward with crypto market structure legislation, they could get even more authority to oversee the digital asset market. And in fact, this bipartisan slate that's under consideration plays into that because Democrats have asked for a quorum requirement at both these agencies to be put in place so that there would have to be members of minority party, whoever's in charge in the future. There would always be minority members for any major agency actions, including rulemaking, and that would be very significant. You know, if if the bill passes, if these agencies do get more crypto authority. Yeah, you make a great point. The crypto market structure legislation is something that we're still awaiting. It didn't get through last year. Could it get done before a Democratic nominee is, you know, installed on the CFTC or would it likely be kind of happening at the same time? It's a good question. I think that that really comes down to one, if the White House decides to move forward with bipartisan nominees at all. But, you know, we're expecting a markup in the Senate Banking Committee on their version of that bill next week. In fact, a week from today. You know what happens after that, if that markups even going to be successful and get the bill out of committee, we don't know yet. We'll see. But typically, these nominees do take many months to come through sort of the whole confirmation process once they're even out from the White House. So, you know, it's hard to say where whether those two tracks will align at all.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:32:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:44:49.609917"}

Jonathan Miller, President, CEO and Co-Founder of the real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel, discusses the industry reaction with Scarlet Fu on \"Bloomberg Markets.\" (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nYou and other experts in this space have made the point that institutional investors are not a big player in the single family rental market, yet they make for a convenient scapegoat. Why is that? Well, I think that, you know, they're very much in the public eye, very visible. They only account for about 1% of the single family housing stock. And it's so banning them from purchasing. I think the perception with the public is that they dominate inventory. They they basically, you know, one of the most challenging aspects of housing and why we're in an affordability crisis is because there's been inadequate supply. However, there are very tiny there, you know, a 1% sort of number. And then on top of it, the highest concentration of institutional investors. Wall Street per say, is in the South, the Sunbelt, which has excess supply right now. So it I'm having a hard time connecting the dots on how this will help improve affordability. I think it's a non-issue generally for solving that problem. You make a lot of important points and it's a reminder of how at the end of the day, real estate is very local. Housing supply and housing demand is very local to each specific market. Yet when it comes to perceptions, there is this sense that these institutional investors, Wall Street type of firms like Blackstone play this outsized role. And part of it is because they came in during the financial crisis in the wake of the financial crisis, and did swoop in and buy a lot of single family homes at a time when Americans were losing their homes. So that looms large in the public consciousness. Absolutely. The perception, you know, perception is value. And and so they were, you know, highly visible coming in and sort of, you know, scooping up 2012, 2013, a tremendous volume of foreclosed homes after the financial crisis and have made it work. And some of the firms have even sold off part of their portfolios. As you know, the market has peaked in the last couple of years. So I don't see I see this as this disconnected from what the actual problem is. The problem is to enhance affordability. And I don't think the institutional aspect of the housing market has much to do with it. Right. Well, to be fair, President Trump is not the only one who has suggested something like this. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, has also said something similar. So this is a bipartisan kind of approach to trying to tackle affordability in the housing market. You say the solution is to build more housing, but this that that that takes a long time. That's not something that happens overnight. What kind of timeline are we talking about? Even if you could open the spigot and just allow builders to start building more homes. Yeah. And also, too, you know, a lot of the housing that we're building is skewing to the higher end because of land costs, because of product cost, because of labor costs. All those things make it very difficult. But if you create oversupply or modest oversupply, you place pressure on housing prices and and that sort of melts into the next layer below that and then below that. It is not a sure fire solution, but it's just one of those things. The other thing is, you know, a lot of the challenge of single family affordability has been zoning and cities like Minneapolis have banned single family zoning. New new construction within the municipality and trying to move towards multi-family in high density areas. There's many things that can be done, I think, to your point, that both sides of the aisle are disconnected from the actual problem in this idea that, you know, inventory is inventory is very local, very regional. And when we look at markets like the Northeast or the Midwest, very tight in terms of supply, we look at Sunbelt very soft because they were able to create and build more housing during the migration pattern that we saw during COVID, where people left the Northeast and the West Coast to go to more affordable housing.
