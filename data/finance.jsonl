Ned Lamont (D) told Balance of Power wind power is essential to bringing down energy costs in New England. \n\nThe US is suspending leases for all five wind farms under construction off the East Coast, the latest blow to an industry that’s been targeted repeatedly by the Trump administration as part of its attack on clean energy.\nThe US Interior Department announced the move Monday, citing national security concerns as the massive turbines may interfere with radar systems. The suspension will let the administration work with developers and states to mitigate any security risks, the department said in a statement.\nThe projects impacted are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Coastal Virginia, which lies off the coast of its titular state; Revolution Wind, near Rhode Island; and Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind, both off the coast of New York. The five projects represent about $28b in total committed capital, according to BloombergNEF. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIf, in fact, this is halted here. The mayor of New London, Michael Bizzaro, says the Grinch has just stolen Christmas. Is he right? Not a heck of a Christmas present, was it? What you just heard the president say. It does high wind power, but he's not the leader of things that were committed a long time ago. Are we in revolution when was actually permitted under from one back in 2000, 1890. So a long time ago. So this was a real shock to our system. They did it to us over Labor Day as well. Remember, they had a stop work order, no warning at all this time. They've pulled the permits and we've got to fight like hell to come back because they're never going to bring down the price of electricity in New England unless we get more generation. And that's what wind power does. Governor, in September, your state successfully won its bid in courts to lift the moratorium that the Trump administration put in when it first took office on wind power. Now, the administration is going at it again and raising national security concerns. Some analysts are looking at that and saying this could be a more durable way to essentially do the same thing. What's your take? And do you think those national security concerns are legitimate? No, I think the president said I don't like wind power. Come up with another way that I think you can shut it down. And it was only very recently they came up with these are national security concerns. I talked to the secretary of interior, Doug Burgum. I known for many years. I said, I'm not sure this is real, but if you want to, we'll come down, we'll talk to you about it. We'll bring down the folks building the wind power, the engineers. But don't stop us in maybe construction for the second time in three months. You're just blowing a hole in our efforts to bring down the price of electricity in New England. You know, we understand that this project is about 85% complete. It would power some 350,000 homes across Connecticut and Rhode Island. What will happen to electricity bills without the wind farm more likely to spike if we can't get pipes in the ground and get natural gas and oil? We're just not that type of the state. We don't have the capacity is very rare that we can create our own generation. Offshore wind is one way we can do that. And the more generation we have, the less spiking energy during very cold periods. And that means we can save money for electric ratepayers. We want to welcome our viewers joining us from the TV side, Bloomberg TV colleagues. And we are here with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, talking, of course, about this new announcement out of the Department of Energy today, putting a halt on those five major wind farm projects, including the one that's being assembled in your state. Governor, I'm curious how this is going to play with constituents, not only in your state but across the country as energy prices are expensive, it's cold and they're looking to spike. You know, the energy crisis is something that's constantly talked about. This is also an administration that is trying to remove barriers to other forms of energy, including nuclear. The president has said he wants to restart coal. So why not add wind energy to that? Why is this specific mechanism of generating power in his crosshairs? It is contradictory. I've talked to the president about this. He cares very strongly about bringing down the price of electricity, especially in New England, where we don't have a lot of our own generation and gets expensive. I said, We'll work with you on a nuclear power to work with you on natural gas and other sources. But don't pull the plug on a plant that's already 85% complete, ready to turn on in just a few months. That makes no sense at all. I thought we had an agreement. They weren't going to do that. Then we were shocked. All right. Well, I want to get back to the justification from the administration here, Governor, and I know you commented on this briefly, but I'd like to hear more about the national security concerns or lack there of knowing that the Interior Department says these turbines may interfere with radar systems. We understand, however, according to the attorney general, William Tong, the project's already gone through a federal review. He says fully vetted, permitted state, federal, up and down, inside out every which way you can. Is that correct? WILLIAMS Absolutely correct. And actually, it went through a very strong national security review over the last few years, voted on on a bipartisan basis in Congress just a year and a half ago. What they said with the administration just making this already, it is the administration just making this up then. I think so. But look, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Get us down there. Will bring the very best engineers from worst. Ed, who's a developer, will talk it through. But there's no excuse for shutting this down in mid-stride. Not in the ninth inning of the ballgame. Look, they're saying drones has changed the world dramatically. They want to take a second look and, you know, on shore radar and then change the world in the last 12 months. Also, this is not the point you made earlier. This is not a new technology. These wind turbines have existed in Europe, much to the president's chagrin, for quite a few years now. We haven't previously heard of it having big impacts on NAITO or Europe's military readiness in offshore areas there. We've also got some reporting from Bloomberg and analysts at Raymond James saying I'm skeptical that there's any new information about the military concerns all of a sudden that singlehandedly warrants these projects being halted. So do you think this is an aesthetic, not necessarily an economic or national security decision? You know, I mean, last time around it was birds and whales. This time around, it's radar. I don't know what it's going to be next time. I got to tell you, I come out of the business world. I thought the Trump administration had a lot of business folks and it was going to be a pro-business administration. But this herky jerky on again, off again. First, they didn't snap. Now they're doing wind power. Makes it very difficult to do business with this administration. Very difficult. Well, I'd like to hear more about that just from your view. In Connecticut, you mentioned SNAP. We can add Obamacare subsidies that are about to expire, sending people's bills higher. How much are you and other governors working to fill affordability gaps that are being created by the administration? I can tell you here in Connecticut, we've set aside, you know, $500 million just to lease protect the most vulnerable. But the idea that you're going to yank food support from working families when food prices have almost doubled in the last five years made no sense. And it's pointed out when it comes to the health care subsidies on the exchange, people are going to see their bills go up one or $2,000. That's a heck of a Christmas present. And that's a real shock to the system. So we made sure that we protected all of our families up to about 128,000. Then we soften the blow for everybody else. Governor, you said you've been talking to the Trump administration throughout this process and about this decision, how they're treating it previously. I'm wondering, did you get any kind of a heads up? Have you spoken to the president since this decision came down? And if not, what do you want to tell him? No, This really came out of left field at the very last moment. We had had a conference call, all the governors with secretaries. And right just a couple of weeks ago talking about pipelines and natural gas just did not come up at all. Like I said, I think this is a problem, a solution, looking for a problem and it's the wrong solution. Just lastly, then, Governor, what would you tell people driving to work today in Putnam, Connecticut, who are already looking at expensive electric bills? They're worried about the data center that might be coming in next door. Do they need to brace for higher prices? And what will they look like in 2026? Well, we're seeing a pause on data centers just because they suck so much electricity and drive up costs. But one of the things we need is more generation. I think those rate payers in Putnam know all too well. We're doing everything we can to add more electricity generation, bring down costs for you and your family and call the Cleveland revolution. Win in the ninth inning. Makes no sense at all. Well, this is something that we're going to keep talking about here. It sounds like you might not have a sense or be able to quantify how much those bills are going to rise. Governor, is that fair to say? I can tell you that it's going to go up and it could go up dramatically during very cold times when wind power is generating the most and we're going to have a spike in energy demand. That's what I'm trying to protect you from.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:34:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:32.832007"}

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nCan. Logan, great to have both of you here in studio. Of course, the kickoff to season three of the Golden Touch and talk a little bit about just the process of filming this series for Netflix, of course, alongside Logan Paul, who appears in at least two or three of those episodes here. Oh, look, I love the show, You know, King of Collectibles, The Golden Touch. This is our third season launch today. It's, you know, takes you into the incredible world of collectibles. The value of the items, the history behind it, the story of the chase, the excitement, and also the personalities that collect the items that buy the items. And you know why the collectibles are so incredibly important. It's a fast paced show, and I love doing it. I'm I hope I'm doing it ten years from now. When you talk about personalities, no one's a bigger personality than Logan. Paul, you seem to be clutching your chest right now. Is that because you're wearing a very expensive jacket? Yeah. Well, yeah, the jacket is expensive, but that's neither here nor there. No, it's because I have the most expensive Pokemon card around my neck, and I. Yeah, Look, Super Bowl might be one of one PSA ten Pikachu Illustrator that is on season three of show, the most coveted card in the world. Absolutely. So those folks who aren't Pokémon experts, I mean, you famously bought this card back in 2021, the most expensive one ever. And this is a rarity. I mean, these cards weren't really sold. They were just kind of given out. Right. And at some point, you managed to get a hold of one of the few, not only just intact ones, but I'm pretty sure this is the highest rated one out there. Yeah, it's the only one in the world that's a PSA ten. Meaning it's perfect. Yeah. And like I said, it's one of one. Like you said, it was one of 39 copies handed out in 1998 for a Pokemon illustration contest. So this card couldn't be bought. It was earned, which is part of the reason why the lore contributes to such a high value for the card. When you pay what by most reports is upwards of $5 million. For this, there are a lot of people. They said you are an idiot. Yeah. Like, what is he doing? Who would pay that much for a card? Now I'm told that you're actually willing to put this back onto the market. You think you're going to get more than the five $5.3 million that you paid for it? Look, that's honestly always the goal, right? But I actually say willing is a great word. I had to be convinced to put this card at auction. Ken has chased me for years trying to convince you to sell the card. And let's be honest, the Pokemon market is as hot as it's ever been right now. And those people who thought I was an idiot, I think I'm the one laughing in the face now because Pokemon has delivered higher returns than the stock market in the past 20 years. Buy it by upwards of 3,000%. And so while I think this will probably go for more than I bought it for, it's an auction, but it is the best card in the world. There's nothing like it and it's a piece of history now. I wore it out to my WrestleMania debut. It's on Ken's Netflix show, and I think we're excited to see what he can go for. And it's funny you bring it up and we talk about this idea of collecting or just let's start with art, right? That was what if you had a lot of money, you bought your your Monets or Jackson Pollock, things like that. There was sort of this wave a few years ago with this younger generation coming in, Ken, as you know, that were much more interested in things like Pokemon cards, Magic, the gathering cards, sports memorabilia, and a lot of people kind of scratch their heads. What's that really worth? Comic books, you know, hip hop memorabilia. It's really expanded. Talk about how that's expanded your business away from the more traditional collectibles that we think about here. What you have to realize is that collectibles as a category right now is an asset class. It is an alternative asset class. And while maybe in, you know, in 100 years ago and also in the 1930, 40 or 5060s, you know, collecting art, whether it was Picasso, whether it was Renoir, whether it was Monet, Warhol to go more recent, you know, was what the, quote, super Rich did. And that was the traditional collectibles. You know, people who, you know, grew up worshipping athletes and people you know of, you know, a little younger than me who grew up on Pokemon, which has its 30th anniversary in February this year. You know, they did not grow up dreaming about owning a big art collection. And as they get into their thirties and forties and fifties and late twenties, they have a lot of money. So to them, owning the best of the best, whether it's a Pokemon card, whether it's a game used jersey, whether it's a sports card, that is what they aspire to be, and that is how we can see something like a basketball card with pictures of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant sell for 12 and a half million dollars. Yeah, that's how we can see a jersey worn by Babe Ruth sell for 24 million. That's how I can sell a baseball that was hit by Shohei Ohtani for 4.4 million. And that's how we can see, you know, the Pokemon illustrator. This single best card. Yeah, I did the entire poker. My genre, which is the world's biggest franchise, sell for eight figures. But there's also added value to it as well. Obviously the card in and of itself has value, but the fact that it's associated with someone like Logan Paul or you have a celebrity, I mean, there's a rarity, as you know, in the collectibles market that drives price. And you talk about you wearing it in your WWE debut and the other facts. I mean, that has to add to the value, right? Not only that, am I going to get this illustrator card, but I'm taking the illustrator card that was once owned by Logan Paul We will see. I would I would certainly think. Right. But the card's only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Like Ken said, Pokemon is the highest grossing, most popular franchise in the world. It's a Guinness World Record setting card as well at this point. So yeah, it has the lore, it has the story, It does have all of the ingredients include the actual substances substance of the card itself. Yeah. To potentially sell for eight figures like Ken said. But you know, well we'll see what people are willing to pay for it. I would also like to point out most people don't wear eight figures around their neck. Is now is the is the change is the framing and the changes that come with it. It just doesn't. Yeah. And I asked if I could do it. I want to hand-deliver it to the buyer because when I bought this card from the guy who I chased it down for from four years, he was in Dubai and he made it an experience for me and it contributed to how I felt about the card. And so who for whoever buys it, I would like to reciprocate that and make it an experience for them as well by delivering it myself. Logan Talk about some of the other things that you've bought, collectibles that you've bought, and I am curious also, how do you make sure that what you're getting is authentic, that you don't sort of get taken by somebody trying to find something off? Well, actually, I've bought a decent art from Golden Auctions, and the goal there is that auction houses have a reputation, and that reputation hopefully means that the items you're buying from them is authentic. So the authenticity is kind of like a check when I buy most of these items. But man, I'm a I'm a collector of all sorts of things. I have Michael Jordan Fleer rookie and PSA ten. I have Erling Haaland's, one of one super factor. I got Wayne Gretzky's last championship game hockey stick for $336,000. I bought a meteorite older than the Earth, 4.5 billion years old for like $80,000. KS bears the dinosaur skull. A triceratops skull in my living room. Yeah. Painting a Bob Ross, Right? Dude, I love collectibles. Yeah, because they mean something to me. They're an art piece, and hopefully they appreciate in value because it's part of this strategic asset class that I think people are now finally becoming aware of and so can talk about that asset class. I mean, we're talking about a market now, the collectibles market. If you just take traditional art out of it, you're talking about a few hundred dollars Billion now and it gets you this idea of what comes next. I mean, what do you think that next generation are going to be chasing after? Because I assume it's going to be something maybe a little bit different. Sure. I mean, look, I think as far as sports cards, what I tell people is, you know, professional baseball has been around since the 1860s and baseball cards have been around since the 1860s. So I think the traditional stuff, like trading cards of all genres, you know, is certainly going to continue to only rise in popularity, especially when you have some of the larger companies like PSA and fanatics with, you know, billions of dollars invested in the industry and athletes getting into it. You know, anything can really become a collectible. And to me, you know, just because I don't collect what somebody else collects doesn't mean it's not a collectible. For example, we had our first ever rock and roll and hip hop auction. We set records. I mean, whether it was Tupac, whether it was Nirvana, whether it was Guns and Roses, this stuff was going for Absolutely. Eminem. I mean, crazy prices for four albums and four greatest albums. And what really made the trading card market take off? Yeah, is when the great grading companies came in. And now there are companies that grade, you know, cassettes and albums and CDs and the market's taking off. And it's funny to mention, I mean, the hip hop auction was big. You know, somebody who collects a lot of stuff from hip hop, a lot of the stuff was seen as worthless just a few years ago. And now you have, I think with Christie's or Sotheby's doing their own sort of hip hop auctions. But it gets to this idea and I want to get to this idea with you, Logan, the idea of kind of being an outsider, I mean, your fame and your celebrity did not go through the traditional path, obviously, with Vine and YouTube and eventually with wrestling and all the other ventures that you have here. And I do wonder if that parallels kind of what we're seeing also in collectibles, where you have people just saying, no, we don't need to do it the old fashioned way in terms of, you know, what we collect and how it's true. I mean, yeah, collecting is nice because if you're passionate about something or even just care a little bit, you can make a foray into the hobby. Like, Dude, I started collecting rocks when I was a kid and then it moved to coins and then it graduated to footballs. And my interests have changed and I made a lot of money and I spend it on cardboard and, you know, like you said. Some people laughed at me at the time. But collecting is nice because like, you don't need a credential to start. You can just buy things that interest you. And you know, like I said, the goal is always that they appreciate in value. All right. Season three is out now or coming out now. What else is next for you and you and Logan? Well, we we have a as people will find out by watching the show. We have planned together what we believe will be the biggest TCG trading card game auction in history. The illustrator is going to be the anchor and there is going to be millions and millions and millions of other dollars of other items. You know, Pokémon Magic, The Gathering, and similar items. And we're going to have the auction is going to launch in January. It's going to close February 15th and timing it for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon. And that's something that, you know, we're looking you know, my worst case scenario on that is 15 million. I'd love to do a 25 or $30 million auction with that. And that's that's really, to me, a big event for the industry. I can tell you what's happening for the industry right now. Over the past six weeks, I've been contacted by multiple firms that are either in existence or just starting up or want to start up to have, you know, basically funds dedicated to collectibles. When you say funds like coins, like like, like, like, like, like a gold fund or a crypto fund, but a collectible fund and, you know, whether it's $50 million or 250 million, we seen that, I mean, or something like an even an ETF or something. That's exactly what people are looking to do for now. There is there is one company out there that is doing it. They're doing it solely with basketball cards. These these people want to do a more broader basket. And, you know, as as probably hobby wise, the most well-known guy, they're coming to me and asking for advice. But I, I think that that is really going to take the market to the next level. And you think that's possible? I mean, what are the regulations? You think there is a successful fund? Yes, that's operating right now. Yeah. And but it's very private, very closely held. Sure. But I do think that, you know, there's so much opportunity, I expect that to happen.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:31:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:42:12.375284"}
