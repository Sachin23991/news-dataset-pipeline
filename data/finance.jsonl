Ned Lamont (D) told Balance of Power wind power is essential to bringing down energy costs in New England. \n\nThe US is suspending leases for all five wind farms under construction off the East Coast, the latest blow to an industry that’s been targeted repeatedly by the Trump administration as part of its attack on clean energy.\nThe US Interior Department announced the move Monday, citing national security concerns as the massive turbines may interfere with radar systems. The suspension will let the administration work with developers and states to mitigate any security risks, the department said in a statement.\nThe projects impacted are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Coastal Virginia, which lies off the coast of its titular state; Revolution Wind, near Rhode Island; and Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind, both off the coast of New York. The five projects represent about $28b in total committed capital, according to BloombergNEF. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIf, in fact, this is halted here. The mayor of New London, Michael Bizzaro, says the Grinch has just stolen Christmas. Is he right? Not a heck of a Christmas present, was it? What you just heard the president say. It does high wind power, but he's not the leader of things that were committed a long time ago. Are we in revolution when was actually permitted under from one back in 2000, 1890. So a long time ago. So this was a real shock to our system. They did it to us over Labor Day as well. Remember, they had a stop work order, no warning at all this time. They've pulled the permits and we've got to fight like hell to come back because they're never going to bring down the price of electricity in New England unless we get more generation. And that's what wind power does. Governor, in September, your state successfully won its bid in courts to lift the moratorium that the Trump administration put in when it first took office on wind power. Now, the administration is going at it again and raising national security concerns. Some analysts are looking at that and saying this could be a more durable way to essentially do the same thing. What's your take? And do you think those national security concerns are legitimate? No, I think the president said I don't like wind power. Come up with another way that I think you can shut it down. And it was only very recently they came up with these are national security concerns. I talked to the secretary of interior, Doug Burgum. I known for many years. I said, I'm not sure this is real, but if you want to, we'll come down, we'll talk to you about it. We'll bring down the folks building the wind power, the engineers. But don't stop us in maybe construction for the second time in three months. You're just blowing a hole in our efforts to bring down the price of electricity in New England. You know, we understand that this project is about 85% complete. It would power some 350,000 homes across Connecticut and Rhode Island. What will happen to electricity bills without the wind farm more likely to spike if we can't get pipes in the ground and get natural gas and oil? We're just not that type of the state. We don't have the capacity is very rare that we can create our own generation. Offshore wind is one way we can do that. And the more generation we have, the less spiking energy during very cold periods. And that means we can save money for electric ratepayers. We want to welcome our viewers joining us from the TV side, Bloomberg TV colleagues. And we are here with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, talking, of course, about this new announcement out of the Department of Energy today, putting a halt on those five major wind farm projects, including the one that's being assembled in your state. Governor, I'm curious how this is going to play with constituents, not only in your state but across the country as energy prices are expensive, it's cold and they're looking to spike. You know, the energy crisis is something that's constantly talked about. This is also an administration that is trying to remove barriers to other forms of energy, including nuclear. The president has said he wants to restart coal. So why not add wind energy to that? Why is this specific mechanism of generating power in his crosshairs? It is contradictory. I've talked to the president about this. He cares very strongly about bringing down the price of electricity, especially in New England, where we don't have a lot of our own generation and gets expensive. I said, We'll work with you on a nuclear power to work with you on natural gas and other sources. But don't pull the plug on a plant that's already 85% complete, ready to turn on in just a few months. That makes no sense at all. I thought we had an agreement. They weren't going to do that. Then we were shocked. All right. Well, I want to get back to the justification from the administration here, Governor, and I know you commented on this briefly, but I'd like to hear more about the national security concerns or lack there of knowing that the Interior Department says these turbines may interfere with radar systems. We understand, however, according to the attorney general, William Tong, the project's already gone through a federal review. He says fully vetted, permitted state, federal, up and down, inside out every which way you can. Is that correct? WILLIAMS Absolutely correct. And actually, it went through a very strong national security review over the last few years, voted on on a bipartisan basis in Congress just a year and a half ago. What they said with the administration just making this already, it is the administration just making this up then. I think so. But look, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Get us down there. Will bring the very best engineers from worst. Ed, who's a developer, will talk it through. But there's no excuse for shutting this down in mid-stride. Not in the ninth inning of the ballgame. Look, they're saying drones has changed the world dramatically. They want to take a second look and, you know, on shore radar and then change the world in the last 12 months. Also, this is not the point you made earlier. This is not a new technology. These wind turbines have existed in Europe, much to the president's chagrin, for quite a few years now. We haven't previously heard of it having big impacts on NAITO or Europe's military readiness in offshore areas there. We've also got some reporting from Bloomberg and analysts at Raymond James saying I'm skeptical that there's any new information about the military concerns all of a sudden that singlehandedly warrants these projects being halted. So do you think this is an aesthetic, not necessarily an economic or national security decision? You know, I mean, last time around it was birds and whales. This time around, it's radar. I don't know what it's going to be next time. I got to tell you, I come out of the business world. I thought the Trump administration had a lot of business folks and it was going to be a pro-business administration. But this herky jerky on again, off again. First, they didn't snap. Now they're doing wind power. Makes it very difficult to do business with this administration. Very difficult. Well, I'd like to hear more about that just from your view. In Connecticut, you mentioned SNAP. We can add Obamacare subsidies that are about to expire, sending people's bills higher. How much are you and other governors working to fill affordability gaps that are being created by the administration? I can tell you here in Connecticut, we've set aside, you know, $500 million just to lease protect the most vulnerable. But the idea that you're going to yank food support from working families when food prices have almost doubled in the last five years made no sense. And it's pointed out when it comes to the health care subsidies on the exchange, people are going to see their bills go up one or $2,000. That's a heck of a Christmas present. And that's a real shock to the system. So we made sure that we protected all of our families up to about 128,000. Then we soften the blow for everybody else. Governor, you said you've been talking to the Trump administration throughout this process and about this decision, how they're treating it previously. I'm wondering, did you get any kind of a heads up? Have you spoken to the president since this decision came down? And if not, what do you want to tell him? No, This really came out of left field at the very last moment. We had had a conference call, all the governors with secretaries. And right just a couple of weeks ago talking about pipelines and natural gas just did not come up at all. Like I said, I think this is a problem, a solution, looking for a problem and it's the wrong solution. Just lastly, then, Governor, what would you tell people driving to work today in Putnam, Connecticut, who are already looking at expensive electric bills? They're worried about the data center that might be coming in next door. Do they need to brace for higher prices? And what will they look like in 2026? Well, we're seeing a pause on data centers just because they suck so much electricity and drive up costs. But one of the things we need is more generation. I think those rate payers in Putnam know all too well. We're doing everything we can to add more electricity generation, bring down costs for you and your family and call the Cleveland revolution. Win in the ninth inning. Makes no sense at all. Well, this is something that we're going to keep talking about here. It sounds like you might not have a sense or be able to quantify how much those bills are going to rise. Governor, is that fair to say? I can tell you that it's going to go up and it could go up dramatically during very cold times when wind power is generating the most and we're going to have a spike in energy demand. That's what I'm trying to protect you from.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:34:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:32.832007"}

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nCan. Logan, great to have both of you here in studio. Of course, the kickoff to season three of the Golden Touch and talk a little bit about just the process of filming this series for Netflix, of course, alongside Logan Paul, who appears in at least two or three of those episodes here. Oh, look, I love the show, You know, King of Collectibles, The Golden Touch. This is our third season launch today. It's, you know, takes you into the incredible world of collectibles. The value of the items, the history behind it, the story of the chase, the excitement, and also the personalities that collect the items that buy the items. And you know why the collectibles are so incredibly important. It's a fast paced show, and I love doing it. I'm I hope I'm doing it ten years from now. When you talk about personalities, no one's a bigger personality than Logan. Paul, you seem to be clutching your chest right now. Is that because you're wearing a very expensive jacket? Yeah. Well, yeah, the jacket is expensive, but that's neither here nor there. No, it's because I have the most expensive Pokemon card around my neck, and I. Yeah, Look, Super Bowl might be one of one PSA ten Pikachu Illustrator that is on season three of show, the most coveted card in the world. Absolutely. So those folks who aren't Pokémon experts, I mean, you famously bought this card back in 2021, the most expensive one ever. And this is a rarity. I mean, these cards weren't really sold. They were just kind of given out. Right. And at some point, you managed to get a hold of one of the few, not only just intact ones, but I'm pretty sure this is the highest rated one out there. Yeah, it's the only one in the world that's a PSA ten. Meaning it's perfect. Yeah. And like I said, it's one of one. Like you said, it was one of 39 copies handed out in 1998 for a Pokemon illustration contest. So this card couldn't be bought. It was earned, which is part of the reason why the lore contributes to such a high value for the card. When you pay what by most reports is upwards of $5 million. For this, there are a lot of people. They said you are an idiot. Yeah. Like, what is he doing? Who would pay that much for a card? Now I'm told that you're actually willing to put this back onto the market. You think you're going to get more than the five $5.3 million that you paid for it? Look, that's honestly always the goal, right? But I actually say willing is a great word. I had to be convinced to put this card at auction. Ken has chased me for years trying to convince you to sell the card. And let's be honest, the Pokemon market is as hot as it's ever been right now. And those people who thought I was an idiot, I think I'm the one laughing in the face now because Pokemon has delivered higher returns than the stock market in the past 20 years. Buy it by upwards of 3,000%. And so while I think this will probably go for more than I bought it for, it's an auction, but it is the best card in the world. There's nothing like it and it's a piece of history now. I wore it out to my WrestleMania debut. It's on Ken's Netflix show, and I think we're excited to see what he can go for. And it's funny you bring it up and we talk about this idea of collecting or just let's start with art, right? That was what if you had a lot of money, you bought your your Monets or Jackson Pollock, things like that. There was sort of this wave a few years ago with this younger generation coming in, Ken, as you know, that were much more interested in things like Pokemon cards, Magic, the gathering cards, sports memorabilia, and a lot of people kind of scratch their heads. What's that really worth? Comic books, you know, hip hop memorabilia. It's really expanded. Talk about how that's expanded your business away from the more traditional collectibles that we think about here. What you have to realize is that collectibles as a category right now is an asset class. It is an alternative asset class. And while maybe in, you know, in 100 years ago and also in the 1930, 40 or 5060s, you know, collecting art, whether it was Picasso, whether it was Renoir, whether it was Monet, Warhol to go more recent, you know, was what the, quote, super Rich did. And that was the traditional collectibles. You know, people who, you know, grew up worshipping athletes and people you know of, you know, a little younger than me who grew up on Pokemon, which has its 30th anniversary in February this year. You know, they did not grow up dreaming about owning a big art collection. And as they get into their thirties and forties and fifties and late twenties, they have a lot of money. So to them, owning the best of the best, whether it's a Pokemon card, whether it's a game used jersey, whether it's a sports card, that is what they aspire to be, and that is how we can see something like a basketball card with pictures of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant sell for 12 and a half million dollars. Yeah, that's how we can see a jersey worn by Babe Ruth sell for 24 million. That's how I can sell a baseball that was hit by Shohei Ohtani for 4.4 million. And that's how we can see, you know, the Pokemon illustrator. This single best card. Yeah, I did the entire poker. My genre, which is the world's biggest franchise, sell for eight figures. But there's also added value to it as well. Obviously the card in and of itself has value, but the fact that it's associated with someone like Logan Paul or you have a celebrity, I mean, there's a rarity, as you know, in the collectibles market that drives price. And you talk about you wearing it in your WWE debut and the other facts. I mean, that has to add to the value, right? Not only that, am I going to get this illustrator card, but I'm taking the illustrator card that was once owned by Logan Paul We will see. I would I would certainly think. Right. But the card's only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Like Ken said, Pokemon is the highest grossing, most popular franchise in the world. It's a Guinness World Record setting card as well at this point. So yeah, it has the lore, it has the story, It does have all of the ingredients include the actual substances substance of the card itself. Yeah. To potentially sell for eight figures like Ken said. But you know, well we'll see what people are willing to pay for it. I would also like to point out most people don't wear eight figures around their neck. Is now is the is the change is the framing and the changes that come with it. It just doesn't. Yeah. And I asked if I could do it. I want to hand-deliver it to the buyer because when I bought this card from the guy who I chased it down for from four years, he was in Dubai and he made it an experience for me and it contributed to how I felt about the card. And so who for whoever buys it, I would like to reciprocate that and make it an experience for them as well by delivering it myself. Logan Talk about some of the other things that you've bought, collectibles that you've bought, and I am curious also, how do you make sure that what you're getting is authentic, that you don't sort of get taken by somebody trying to find something off? Well, actually, I've bought a decent art from Golden Auctions, and the goal there is that auction houses have a reputation, and that reputation hopefully means that the items you're buying from them is authentic. So the authenticity is kind of like a check when I buy most of these items. But man, I'm a I'm a collector of all sorts of things. I have Michael Jordan Fleer rookie and PSA ten. I have Erling Haaland's, one of one super factor. I got Wayne Gretzky's last championship game hockey stick for $336,000. I bought a meteorite older than the Earth, 4.5 billion years old for like $80,000. KS bears the dinosaur skull. A triceratops skull in my living room. Yeah. Painting a Bob Ross, Right? Dude, I love collectibles. Yeah, because they mean something to me. They're an art piece, and hopefully they appreciate in value because it's part of this strategic asset class that I think people are now finally becoming aware of and so can talk about that asset class. I mean, we're talking about a market now, the collectibles market. If you just take traditional art out of it, you're talking about a few hundred dollars Billion now and it gets you this idea of what comes next. I mean, what do you think that next generation are going to be chasing after? Because I assume it's going to be something maybe a little bit different. Sure. I mean, look, I think as far as sports cards, what I tell people is, you know, professional baseball has been around since the 1860s and baseball cards have been around since the 1860s. So I think the traditional stuff, like trading cards of all genres, you know, is certainly going to continue to only rise in popularity, especially when you have some of the larger companies like PSA and fanatics with, you know, billions of dollars invested in the industry and athletes getting into it. You know, anything can really become a collectible. And to me, you know, just because I don't collect what somebody else collects doesn't mean it's not a collectible. For example, we had our first ever rock and roll and hip hop auction. We set records. I mean, whether it was Tupac, whether it was Nirvana, whether it was Guns and Roses, this stuff was going for Absolutely. Eminem. I mean, crazy prices for four albums and four greatest albums. And what really made the trading card market take off? Yeah, is when the great grading companies came in. And now there are companies that grade, you know, cassettes and albums and CDs and the market's taking off. And it's funny to mention, I mean, the hip hop auction was big. You know, somebody who collects a lot of stuff from hip hop, a lot of the stuff was seen as worthless just a few years ago. And now you have, I think with Christie's or Sotheby's doing their own sort of hip hop auctions. But it gets to this idea and I want to get to this idea with you, Logan, the idea of kind of being an outsider, I mean, your fame and your celebrity did not go through the traditional path, obviously, with Vine and YouTube and eventually with wrestling and all the other ventures that you have here. And I do wonder if that parallels kind of what we're seeing also in collectibles, where you have people just saying, no, we don't need to do it the old fashioned way in terms of, you know, what we collect and how it's true. I mean, yeah, collecting is nice because if you're passionate about something or even just care a little bit, you can make a foray into the hobby. Like, Dude, I started collecting rocks when I was a kid and then it moved to coins and then it graduated to footballs. And my interests have changed and I made a lot of money and I spend it on cardboard and, you know, like you said. Some people laughed at me at the time. But collecting is nice because like, you don't need a credential to start. You can just buy things that interest you. And you know, like I said, the goal is always that they appreciate in value. All right. Season three is out now or coming out now. What else is next for you and you and Logan? Well, we we have a as people will find out by watching the show. We have planned together what we believe will be the biggest TCG trading card game auction in history. The illustrator is going to be the anchor and there is going to be millions and millions and millions of other dollars of other items. You know, Pokémon Magic, The Gathering, and similar items. And we're going to have the auction is going to launch in January. It's going to close February 15th and timing it for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon. And that's something that, you know, we're looking you know, my worst case scenario on that is 15 million. I'd love to do a 25 or $30 million auction with that. And that's that's really, to me, a big event for the industry. I can tell you what's happening for the industry right now. Over the past six weeks, I've been contacted by multiple firms that are either in existence or just starting up or want to start up to have, you know, basically funds dedicated to collectibles. When you say funds like coins, like like, like, like, like, like a gold fund or a crypto fund, but a collectible fund and, you know, whether it's $50 million or 250 million, we seen that, I mean, or something like an even an ETF or something. That's exactly what people are looking to do for now. There is there is one company out there that is doing it. They're doing it solely with basketball cards. These these people want to do a more broader basket. And, you know, as as probably hobby wise, the most well-known guy, they're coming to me and asking for advice. But I, I think that that is really going to take the market to the next level. And you think that's possible? I mean, what are the regulations? You think there is a successful fund? Yes, that's operating right now. Yeah. And but it's very private, very closely held. Sure. But I do think that, you know, there's so much opportunity, I expect that to happen.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:31:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:42:12.375284"}

{"title": "Baby Bonds vs. Trump Accounts", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-12-24/baby-bonds-vs-trump-accounts-video", "summary": "A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. Darrick Hamilton, Henry Cohen Professor of Economics and Urban Policy at the New School, is behind a comparable concept known as \"baby bonds,\" which he sees as a means to granting more social mobility and agency to young people regardless of family income levels. Professor Hamilton compares and contrasts his idea with the Trump administration's mechanism with Alexis Christoforous and Isabelle Lee on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat is, I guess, the main difference between baby bonds and the Trump accounts? Because on their face, there seem to be a lot of similarities. Well, conceptually, the goal is to provide access to asset building by way of having some financial capital so that you can get into that building. The problem with the Trump accounts versus baby bonds is baby bonds focus on what actually is the problem. It's one of endowment, essentially the way wealth is created, as wealth begets more wealth. It's having a large enough nest egg so that you can get into a home or get into an education without debt, or to be able to have some capital to start a business. The Trump accounts essentially emphasize savings by way of the tax code. So in an ironic way, it's structured in a way that's potentially going to subsidize those that have the wherewithal to raise capital in the first place. What does it signal to you when billionaires step in to fund used wealth building programs? Are we seeing it as innovation that government couldn't achieve on its own, or is it just a quiet shift away from maybe public responsibility? I mean, I applaud philanthropy that desires to be vanguards and trying to create pathways to democratize wealth. However, however, the mechanism in this case is only feeding into a bad system. The federal government should not be ultimately subsidized for their duty. We shouldn't be reliant on the charitable contributions of a billionaire for our salvation. But what a billionaire can do is provide demonstration, be a catalyst, seed some some momentum so that we ultimately can have them invest. And, you know, I'll make one other quick point, which is when you think about the $6.4 billion, which is a huge number, it requires context. So two context points. One is it's contextual to that $4 trillion big, beautiful bill that was referenced at the beginning of the segment. So if we're thinking about the ways in which the federal government is spending wealth towards advancing access to asset building for the population, that 6.4 billion deserves context to that $4 trillion, which is from our public regress. And then the other context, about 80% of children between the ages of zero and ten will have some access to this donation, this regress. But if you were to disaggregate that, that amounts to about $250 per child. Right. So essentially, that's not going to be the catalyst. So it's distracting a little bit. You know, some countries have done this pretty successfully, right? I know. I believe Germany is among them. They'll give an allowance, a monthly allowance to parents for for kids of a certain age. Some countries use it as an incentive to get people to have more children. It's now these baby bonds have been implemented in, let's say, Connecticut since 2023. I believe they were the first state. How are things going? Oh, it's still the infancy there, but how are things going? I mean, Connecticut is a really great model and it's a state, so it doesn't have the capacities of the federal government. But here you have a scenario with every Medicaid birth will receive 30 $200 automatically at birth. And the Treasurer is managing that money in a collective fund in an astute way with responsible investing, where the projections are that the children, you know, low income children born as part of a medicaid birth from rural to urban areas throughout the state will have about 12 to 18000 as some seed capital to begin wealth building. Any you know, other examples would be the U.K. did it. They didn't fund it to the extent that we would call for in the U.S. And then here's perhaps even the best counterfactual. The United States has done similar programs with the GI Bill. That's about right. We have a history of doing this. Do you think that programs like these have an influence to affect economic policy long term, or do you think to create risking a system that just really hinges on, to your point, philanthropy of maybe rich individuals or big corporations? And that's exactly why it should be a government responsibility. And here's the point. This is not charity. This is an investment. So if you believe in the market, if you don't believe in the market regardless, again, it's pretty simple. The way wealth is created, it is that down payment to put you in an asset that passively appreciates over your life. So if you are authentically somebody who believes in transaction in the market, then you should support people having some seed capital to get into that asset. So again, it's a question of endowment, not savings behavior. Is there anything about the Trump accounts that you actually like? I mean, we have to I think we can agree that, you know, the concept I mean, the heart's in the right place. You Well, I mean that to sit at the attention of. On trying to make sure that we democratize access to wealth. That's a good thing. But to structure the 529 structure, we have lessons from that where, you know, 529 saving tax provision savings so that we can provide access to college for our children. The bottom half percent of earners essentially don't participate. Only about 2.5% of Americans participate. So there are really good ways we can do it. My fear is that we co-opt a good idea. It's a really good idea. We have pathways to really facilitate a good value for our American economy, which is inclusion. We just got to work on the delivery. To Alexis point, there's the idea of corp match welfare embedded here. Are there any upsides to that? What should policymakers be cautious about? I apologize for laughing, but the phrasing of of of corporate welfare again, I it I take the Dell's is being not disingenuous but really trying to be supportive. I think there's better ways there's more catalytic ways they could spend that $6.4 billion. But at the end of the day, the American people don't want to be at the whim of billionaires. And then there are other aspects as well that we should be leery about, which is state private partnerships for which we have to be concerned about the potential for grift when we're relying on billionaires to provide economic security for the American people. So if if we're thinking, you know, look, a lot of folks are not going to take advantage of a 529 plan, is that because they don't have the money to do it? Is that because they don't know they exist? Is that because a lot of Americans cannot be left to their own devices to save for themselves? I mean, think about how, you know, some of our our programs like Social Security came to be. It's because it was supposed to be some sort of a safety net. So. So is it a good idea for the government to put aside some money for folks who might not otherwise do it? I mean, that actually is a great idea. But just how in the mechanisms by which we do it, that's the problem. So it is the case that clearly we have an affordability crisis in this country so people don't have the wherewithal to save en masse. And that's a big reason why people don't participate in a 529 counts, not as if they don't love and adore their children and desire for them to have savings. It's wherewithal. And then the other big point is for those that have amassed wealth in America, it's not active saving lives, driving debt. And by active savings income that we actively save, it's passive savings. It's that down payment. It is critical for young adults to really have some capital so that they can get into that automatic vehicle to save.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:54:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T06:44:04.353345"}

From politics and policy to tech and trends, David Ingles and Annabelle Droulers give global investors unique insight, delivering in-depth discussions with the newsmakers who matter. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nGood morning. It's 9 a.m. here in Hong Kong, in Shanghai and in Shenzhen. You're watching the China tour, our final full broadcast of the year coming out to the open markets in Greater China. Let's get to top stories today. Stocks across the region up after tech gains pushing Wall Street to yet another record. Ethics markets in focus with the yuan at its strongest level in over 14 months. Seven is very much in focus. And also in South Korea, warning against excessive weakness in their currency. Gold soaring above 40 $500 an ounce for the very first time. And escalating tensions in Venezuela and lots of bets on more Fed rate cuts in 2026. Also ahead, Washington holding off on new tariffs on Chinese chips even after accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices. Plus, we take a closer look at the challenges facing Chinese battery maker Seattle as the company seeks new markets overseas. Welcome to the program. Hope you're all well. Lots to get through over the next 2 hours or so. Let's get started with what's really been a fairly consistent story almost all year round, with the exception of a few wobbles, as we can see the rally across risk assets. Right. Asia Pacific 2 to 7 right now in the benchmark 3/10 of 1%. As you can see, the tech, the tech sub gauge is leading that one. COSBY There's a separate conversation. We'll get to that in a moment. As far as the currency goes, some strong language coming through out of authorities there, leading to some strength coming through in their currency. Taiwan is coming in line within that market. It's not just tech. We're looking at insurers to given this rule change and effects. More on that as well later on. We talked about the one winning today, dollar one down. As you can see, we're up 1%, stronger than 1% on the Korean currency, 1.4, rather, 156 now on dollar yen. The markets there warning of strong determination as it pertains to maybe these moves in the market might have reached maybe a tad or to a level a notch or two beyond what is comfortable. Question mark. Right. The big story as well in markets is when you have copper at 12,000, we took that out yesterday, 4500 and gold, also a nice round number on platinum. We're up about 3% there in silver, of course, 150% year to date. We took out 70 yesterday. It looks like 72 is a very, very close, if not already on time contracts very quickly the approach of the Chinese market open. So we talked about copper coming up on your screens as well and to see you in China is 7017. And the reason that's important, if that puts us about 0.2 6%, 0.27%, just doing some rough math in my head, which roughly translates to about that's about a one standard deviation move historical that's a daily if we get that which is rare of course, statistically that would take us below seven. Suffice to say it's possible, but unlikely. And we are looking at weakness going into the open today. And of course it's a public service reminder that several markets in the region are operating on truncated sessions today Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and also in New Zealand. Okay, let's have a look at the agenda today. And oh, okay. This is the agenda today. Well, it's partly it. So the next rally we had the Fix. It's an early close in Hong Kong, but yeah, okay, we'll talk about this later. Okay. Let's talk about the chip curbs. Right. The US is holding off when new chip Chinese chip towers until MIT. We'll fix that for you is what I'm trying to say. That's despite accusing Beijing of engaging in unfair trade practices in the chip sector. Let's bring in Min Miller, China correspondent here with us on set to tell us more about this investigation. It's it's something that didn't happen overnight was months long. What did the findings and what what it might mean for her policy. Yeah. So it's nearly a year in the making. It was launched in the final few weeks of the former US President Joe Biden's administration, and it was expected that President Trump would resolve this by the findings from the U.S. Trade Representative offices that China has used aggressively and sweeping to use non-market policies to create foreign dependence on its products in a way that was not advantages for U.S. commerce. So the decision is not to impose any tariffs in the next six months, but starting from June 2027, they will impose tariffs, but rates are only going to be announced at least a month before. So this is a clear signal that President Trump is in some ways trying to stabilize ties here and keep to that tweet truce that he agreed with President Xi when they met in South Korea. But at the same time also creating that opening right to revisit this one and a half years later and potentially a bargaining chip when China and U.S. has to renegotiate the extension of the trade truce. Already, we're not even at 2026. You're taking us into mid 2027 amendment. What was China's response to this? So the US, the Chinese embassy in the US has responded and obviously hit back at this, saying that, you know, they're opposed to this and also saying that they will take whatever necessary measures to protect their legitimate rights and interests. And you can see here the statement they said to instrumentalize and weaponize trade and take issues and destabilise global industrial supply chains will benefit no one and will eventually backfire. Now, this comes as China also hit back against the new US rules to ban foreign drones and drone pods, and also saying that that the US is bullying Chinese companies, saying that China reserves the right to protect or safeguard Chinese interests and also calling on the US to withdraw those rules. Right. Thank you so much, Laura, China correspondent there. Our other top story, all the data that came through overnight in the US, obviously the headline was GDP. Within that you had several things like so the two year yield, for example, spiking a little bit. Not a lot of material pricing changes around the Fed. You have consumer confidence numbers separately also showing. Maybe the opposite, but maybe the same. Right. It's a it's a multi multifaceted coin. Consumption and exports driving us growth. On your screens, GDP, of course, coming in north of 4%. Quite a substantial beat looking at where the estimates were to just help us understand the context are guilty says our managing editor who's with us here on set up. Good set of numbers, good growth. Yeah, I mean, look, I think, you know, you're looking at GDP growing at the fastest pace in two years in the third quarter. So obviously some pretty robust figures there. But what you're really looking at here, David, is that the economy did seem to continue to build some momentum, and that's after some of the most severe of the Trump tariffs were actually lifted. So there was a little bit of a reprieve there, not really a ton of impact sort of you're seeing from, you know, some of you know, some of the some of their political issues. I think, you know, we're likely to look at is sort of that continued sort of strength as you as you start to head into 2026. I think the consumer confidence divergence, though, is quite interesting. Maybe tells you a little bit, David, about how the way that people actually spend, because, you know, part of the strength in these GDP figures was really because there was more consumer spending. But, you know, maybe there's a divergence there in how people were actually spending versus how they feel about the economy. I mean, certainly, you know, some concerns there in those consumer confidence numbers about, you know, the labour market going into 20, 26 tariffs, that kind of thing. But at least, you know, that's not showing up in the spending figures just yet. So tells you a little bit there. Yeah, just some breaking news right now. So a judge has upheld the White House's 100,000 fee on H-1B visas, of course, which is a story, of course, that made a lot of waves globally when it was first introduced out of the White House. And it seems to be that will remain the case moving forward. Jill, are you going to comment on this or should we talk about the weakness indication because we know that what it means for the Fed, it's your choice. Yeah, I think we can probably move on to the Fed has been kind of slow to digest, you know, exactly where this kind of goes in terms of the court decisions here for this visa rule. But when we're talking about the Fed here, I think some really interesting comment. Obviously, we're all kind of on tenterhooks waiting for Trump to actually announce whoever his Fed chair nominee is going to be. You've got really the latest comments from Trump. I think we're very, very, you know, in line with what we've come to expect from him, essentially saying that no matter what the economy is doing, essentially he wants whoever his Fed chair pickers who really, really rally for cutting rates, obviously, like, you know, I think some divergence there with, you know, some market fundamentals certainly over the last several decades. It's not about the economy. But I think that, you know, what we're really hearing from Trump is just that he is so adamant about wanting to have somebody in that position who is going to do what Trump wants him to do. Right. Like, I think you've got he he wants lower interest rates and he wants to install somebody that's actually going to tackle that. Of course, David, I mean, we've talked I don't even know how many times about the fact that, you know, it's obviously not just the Fed chair himself that, you know, makes those types of decisions. You know, you have to rally the rest of the FOMC around you to sort of bring something forward. But it does indicate, obviously, you know, Trump is really, really, really wants a Federal Reserve that's essentially going to do what he wants. Does he get that in 2026? I think it is. It is just one vote to the point you're making. Right. So just looking at the dots, too. Thank you so much, Jill. Fantastic. Jill, is there a managing editor now we might not even need to crowbar in lower rates, Right, because there is a case to be made for lower rates. In fact, post these numbers that that that did come out, of course, on consumer confidence, specifically our team at Bloomberg Economics. Let me just paraphrase this and shorten it quite simply. Is that because of the consumer confidence numbers in a weaker side of things, they're a function of labor market health, which is important to the Fed at this point in time. Given that mandates plural, they do expect more rate cuts, an easing in 2026. Right. Speaking of 2026, a market outlook for next year with these markets coming up here and why they think Chinese markets are just starting to win over some long, all the investor that's coming up counting down to the open of trade, Shanghai, Shenzhen and here in Hong Kong, this is the China show. Good morning. Good morning. 17 minutes to the opening bell again, a reminder that it's a shortened session here in Hong Kong today. I think we're at lunch and then, of course, that allows us to ease our way into the stillness of Christmas Eve. Well, I guess depending on what your plans are, certainly in my end, it's going to be it's going to be quiet copper on your screens, of course. And we'll talk more about the commodities rally. But certainly when you look at the commodity complex and the overlay on equity markets, resource heavy markets did also do very, very well this year. Right? Whether that's precious metals, you have copper, that's an air power play as it pertains to the air, obviously has been doing very well. A record low right now across these benchmarks. Asia Pacific, those up 3/10 of 1% this 24th of December to get an outlook for next year. Vanessa Shu is here with us on set, co-founder and CEO at VZ Partners, Hong Kong. Good morning. Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you again. America Christmas. Yes, I'll do it again. Okay. The this year has really been dollar weakness. Stocks have done well. Yes, m m has done well. Do you think m still have room to rally with against the backdrop of just things are no longer as cheap as they were at the start of the year broadly? Well, I think the m good performers will continue because of the fundamentals are driving earnings expansions and driving credit expansions when dollar is going to a easing cycle regardless of, you know, how much and how fast and out of that cuts. Well provide a liquidity support. And the DM market, particularly the US economy is healthy albeit to some cyclical slowdown. So so that provides the demand support for the market. And you know, there is a difference of this growth cycle, which is it is the DM, particularly the US debt has undergone massive expansion on infrastructural constructions of, you know, manufacturing sites, data centers and an expansion in industrial assets and a rebuild capital formation. So that's going to have a demand effect on the EAME supplies. So exports are going to stay healthy, which, you know, the supply from industrial will turn that into consumer spending. Power grows, wage growth in middle income households and wallets and growing. So that's going to provide a fundamental healthy support for. M What if the Fed what is the Fed doesn't cut any more? What if what if they've ended it? Even if the Fed doesn't cut? I think, you know, the we have posted the peak rates perhaps. Right. And inflation expectation has been so far well anchored. Even if the Fed doesn't cut the US fiscal expansion is there and the liquidity is changing from, you know, monetary liquidity that flows into the financial markets, to fiscal liquidity that flows into the real, real industries, to the main street rather than Wall Street. Right? So Wall Street is asset price inflation and Main Street is a real economy expansion, which is going to support demand. I think also the DM has to survive. The PE creates a balance sheet, has been improving, profitability has been solid and cash flow has been solid after corporates has survived of the of the of the PE career to remember two or three years ago we were worried about the debt refinancing was that the cooperative couldn't survive the post-COVID post-COVID world and you have to we had at the peak rates so that and bankruptcy did not go up. Yeah and corporates have fundamental research has survived that cash flow around the price of profitability below. Okay. So that's going to support the M demand. For example, you know, India is perhaps a lagging in the, you know, M with the size, but fundamentally I think India will be picking up in terms of less restrictive of a regulatory environment, more liquidity, because the central bank has cut and the solid households consumption grows. But but India, just to play the devil's advocate, has underperform. For him this year because it neither has a strong air component in the market, nor does it have, nor is it a very resource heavy index, for example. Right, right. So that's the case for India. The two prominent sectors performed very well that India is relatively weaker, but fundamentally, India is at that credit expansion cycle. Is that infrastructure building cycle, the housing market, which an economy housing market is a pillar for the for the economy. After ten years of a down cycle, India as a housing market is booming. Therefore, it will have a, you know, impact on consumption, impact on construction, impact on, you know, durable goods such as the cars and appliances, etc.. So the fundamental has been there. I think MSCI India's earnings growth has been revised up and the financial sector, industrial sector and has been doing very well. So maybe next year. I think India is a is a is a worse look on a relative a value basis. And particularly given the other market has gone up pretty a bit in market. Can I ask you about China? Sure. There's a big swing in attitude from this, an investable tag to certainly a lot of global investors have not only increased allocations, they've asked they've at least explicitly talked about wanting to also increase their allocations even further. There's still question marks. Yes, I think the point you made and I think the point you're making is China does not have to be in a bull market. It just doesn't need we just don't want to be in a bear market. As things stand, you see more allocations going into China next year, even if the macro stays the same. Well, you mentioned one thing, but one thing and the doing there is a gap. So when the mind to begin to change, it takes time, particularly for large, very fundamental lam money to realize perhaps the risk allocation was too bearish and too little for China to actually add a you know, I see or see out office level to change the risk allocation and take actions. All of that takes time. So I think China rebounded the sense that September 24 last year. So it's slightly more than a year and that ended the export industrial compound remained remained healthy, although domestic economy still have some headwinds. So it has triggered the people to deeply rethink about geoeconomics, a rethink about how to look at a China as a fundamentals. And and that takes time I think as long as next year. It is not a bear market that even if it doesn't, the market doesn't go up as much. It will have a and people will allocate it to China more particularly in a broader context. As we mentioned the M still, this is the logic is the GM component and the for sizable capital to deploy to GM, china has to be a you know, Moscow. Is it a better play next year do you think? Is it a benchmark play China I think it's a it's an alpha play. So look at the economy. There is a buy faction. Advanced industrials are cheap, making the semiconductor related to value chains are doing very well. It will continue to do well. And we see a very healthy and strong high quality pipelines of IP also coming to Hong Kong or domestic market for them or for that matter. But on the other side, the consumption remains still, you know, a little bit weak and real estate continue to have dragging, in fact, on the traditional economies, too. So it's a it's a also alpha market for stock pickers. And it's it's a play mainly in Hong Kong because Hong Kong has had, to your point, massive IPOs this year. It's been a very, very good year. And I think you think the world under appreciates the fact that the market structure in Hong Kong is changing Correct. And the market structure trend in meaning that, you know, Hong Kong used to be perceived as, you know, massive state owned companies, the traditional banks and and insurances. And the Hong Kong is lacking innovation and innovation goes to a stop order in China in Shenzhen. But now look at Hong Kong. It has a very well-rounded industry combination of the new issuances and the reassurances. So you can find the leadership almost across board of all industries. So so the innovation force is driving the Hong Kong IPO market to end. The world has not to realize the data. Give it another year. To the world where it will not stand a very strongly. The Hong Kong market structure has fundamentally changed. Okay. Yeah, we we're out of time. We didn't get to talk about private credit alternatives and fixed income. No doubt we'll have more time for that next year. Vanessa, very nice to see you. Very nice to see you, too. A merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mary Kay. Hi to the team for us as well. Vanessa Schuh, their co-founder and CEO at VZ Partners here in Hong Kong. We are flat on a Hang Seng at the open A50. Futures are down about a quarter of 1%. Plenty more heads. A preview of the session. This is the China show. Good morning. Right. Welcome back. Going into the open today. So the seven level on the currency, we're close. It will need to be a fairly statistical aberration esque date to take us below seven. On Dollar China, we'll talk about Sihanouk and MGM China in a moment. We've talked at length already about precious metals. There's a seven year bond. I think it's 8 billion renminbi today and of course, early closed. So we open at nine and then I think we shot at 12. So 3 hours for today. All that is to say it doesn't even matter if the market is open. Right, because investors have largely checked out. So we talked about falling vol and turnover, 15 day moving average on a Hang Seng index turnover charts coming up on your screens Green circle well Christmas theme right green circle is the was the peak this year that's the deep sneak moment from that low and red is where we are and we're at the lowest level at going back to about the start of the deep signalman, right almost come full circle on turnover. But again, on price itself, we are we're certainly holding up near the higher end of this year's range. And Hang Seng index, in fact is on a very note. Have a look at where we are here. $26 in, let's call it that Hang Seng Tech on your screens, dollar China and Hang Seng China. So we're slightly and I'm being generous clearly going into the the open today. The opening bell coming up next. 3 minutes away. This is the China show. Good morning. Right. Each and every day, while not each and every day. Let's call it more. More often than not. You know, I get reminders of how blessed I am to be covering a region as diverse as the Asia Pacific. While we were looking at Japan for potential intervention, we were looking at China for a potential break of seven. What happened was the Koreans came out and gave us those conversations to have separately. But yet that is just to say, of course, lots of stories to get into as we wrap up. Even a very, very quiet session in the equity markets is a massive move down in dollar one today. We were, I think 1.3, 1.4% to the downside there on dollar one. Okay. That is also to say that it has been a outside of that. It's been a it's been a weak dollar story going into that one story this morning. Dollar's weaker, a third day. You had the fix in at 701. I've talked about this in case you missed that, that's about a one Sigma move away on a daily basis that takes us below seven. That doesn't seem to be anything on the agenda. Clearly, we don't know what we don't know, but doesn't seem to be anything that is visible that might act as a catalyst for a one Sigma move down in Dollar China today, as you look at the bond yields and as we changed a page, just a reminder that we have a seven year CGP auction today. Keep an eye on that 88 billion me on offer tend to 1% of the upside just 200 short of the 2600 level on the Hang Seng index. It's quite as far as sector news. There's chips and of course there's drones, which I think we can get to later on as far as the movers go. Obviously, precious metals, that's a separate but related stories. See NOOK is up 3/10 of 1%. Another oil discovery in the Bohai Sea. Not much reaction in the market today one debut coming through ding bought Jan sent on your screens were up 200 plus percent. Beyond that, I can't tell you more really that's a first day of trade so let's put the page please. But suffice to say it's another good day, good trading day. Blue chip stocks in focus. There we go, SMI c up 4.3, while Hong is up about 4%. This has been a fairly consistent move, by the way, since the more threads unveiling their new product on the weekend and that we talked about gold right 4500s on spot silver is up 7172 so it about 70% Silver's up by double Jiangxi copper 1.4%. Putting everything together as far as the copper story is concerned, 12%, 12,000. Iron, copper. There we go. Thank you. 12 one And of course, also, I think we're at 90,000 on a Shanghai contract. Let's bring in our cross assets. Reporter Richard Henderson. He's in Melbourne for us today. Richard, good morning, sir. Thank you for coming on the show. Cross It has been a very busy, busy area this year. Take your pick. Where do we start going into next year? What's top of mind for you, sir? I think stocks is a great place to start. You know, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up 27% for the year so far when you include dividends. And part of it is a dollar story. You know, weakening dollar does flatter some of those returns. But I think underlying that is a great technology story and it really is easy to point to deep sea at the start of the year that showed investors and it comes up all the time when I'm talking to chief investment officers and portfolio managers in the region. It really underscored the type of possibilities and talent that's on offer in China, but also in places like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, where from a hardware and software point of view, it's so tightly integrated into the global technology supply chain and often at a far greater, more attractive valuation, let's say, than the United States. And we see those persistent concerns around the max seven valuation story, for instance. So I think going into 2026, we're going to see investors really like to to build out their tech exposure in Asia, to build on some of those gains and to potentially try and serve up the AI theme at a cheaper price point, basically. Yeah, If you just got out, you don't need to look cross. I said just look across the Pacific And any concerns over valuations, you know, after, you know, after a year and let's take Korea obviously isn't a very extreme example because I think that is the best performing index. And a lot of that has to do with high index and Samsung beneath the hood. After a year that after a year like Korea has had. Are there concerns over market concentration or valuations within that space? Just to maybe just close the door on that on that one? Definitely, Yeah. Those concerns are going to be very key to the to the, you know, the investment thesis for those single names and for the index. But I think we're not really seeing the same levels as we're seeing in the US where, you know, the Mag seven is some 33% of the S & P 500. Now, you know that that makes the, you know, the index so vulnerable to such a few companies. There's also great earnings underpinning some of these supplies in Asia. So so I think given that attractiveness of valuation relative to the US and other global peers, investors will still see a lot of value through through Asia Tech. So I expect that to continue into the new year. Okay. What about credit, sir? What's top of mind going into next year? Credit. Credit, Yeah. Investment grade dollar credit in Asia is heading for its best year since 2019. It's outperformed the US. It's a great, great year for Asia credit. And part of this is, you know, not not a huge gluts of supply and also pretty pretty attractive on the defaults, you know, very low defaults. So, you know, when we talk to portfolio managers, they really like Asia credit at that at that investment grade level. But also high yields had a great had a great year relative to the US. I think it's you know best year in seven from memory so so yeah Asia credit still very attractive and again it's you know it's partly reflecting the relative attractiveness to its global peers. But I think another another strong year for credit potentially in 2026. The it's quite an equity markets and now the news flow keeps keeps giving and I think that you know the Koreans we talked about this and I'm not sure if you heard the what happened there. Of course, the Bank of Korea just now talking about how the NPS was activated, new strategic effect hedging. But just to say, of course, very, very strong language coming through out of Korean authorities on the currency markets. What's obviously against the backdrop of a very weak dollar this year, does the weak dollar continue next year? And how what does that how does it activate regulators that might be maybe too worried over a too weak dollar, for example, or the opposite in the case I guess of of of of the Koreans. Exactly. And you can point to Japan as well. We had comments this week from the finance minister, I believe, reminding the market about the ability for official intervention. Listen, I think because of the Federal Reserve cuts that are forecast in the year ahead, we're going to see a pretty, pretty sort of persistent weakness in the outlook for the dollar. And again, relative to some of those Asian, Asian central banks, Australia and New Zealand, Japan, that are now shifting or already in a tightening cycle that will support their currencies. I think the yen, the dollar weakness trade should should endure until we start to see a shift in in US inflation or jobs. Richard. Fantastic. Thank you, sir. Richard henderson there in oz for us across assets. Reporter. Just very briefly, you know, for many people sorry, may be the hardest word. Not for us. We're sorry we made a mistake. The graphic that we showed you earlier on the show. Silver was up 400%. That did look kind of sketchy, though, to begin with. There's the correct graphic for you. Year to date, that's what we're doing in Silver gold spot and also copper. But you know what? Just to say, it's been a good year still. Right? Okay. Plenty more ahead. This is the China show. Welcome back. You watching the China show? Let's talk about strategic investments, talk about ports. Right. So China's invested, what, billions, billions and billions of dollars really in building ports right around the globe here, giving Beijing a strategic advantage given the trade and tensions conversation. It's breaking security, current concerns as well around the world. And our team at Bloomberg Originals, in fact, has taken a closer look at this trend. Every year, China imports about 66,000 metric tons of these. That's the weight of about six and a half Persian landmarks, or if you like, 440 blue whales. And most of these avocadoes come all the way from Peru. This journey used to take over a month. Now it's a straight shot cut in it by ten days. Why? One word, Megaport. And it's paid for by China. Chinese President Xi Jinping begins a week long South America tour, opening a China funded megaport in Peru. This is a huge investment not only for Peru but in Latin America. And it is expected to triple agricultural exports of Peru over the last 20 years. China has built up a network of about 100 ports on every continent except Antarctica, clustered around key maritime choke points, which are crucial to global trade. This gives China a strategic advantage as global trade tensions rise. But it's also sparking concerns, even though these ports, by and large, commercial ports, some of them do actually have the capacity to host naval vessels. So why did China build a global ports empire? And should Washington be worried about it? Without ports, the global economy pretty much grinds to a halt. Roughly about 80% of global trade is conducted via ships, and ports are crucial to that. Six of the ten busiest ports in the world are located in China. And 95% of the nation's trade is done by sea. China has made itself rich by being able to find markets overseas for its manufactured goods and being able to ship raw materials to China to be processed. So making sure that it has access to a network of global ports is a key part of that. And it's not only ports. China is also the world's biggest maker of container ships, making these generational investments to dominate global trade infrastructure. It's a central pillar of the Belt and Road Initiative. Over the years, it has become President Xi Jinping's signature global initiative, with the goal to strengthen or improve global connectivity through building up infrastructure projects. This has meant modernizing the ancient Silk Road with highways and rail, while securing maritime pathways in and out of China. Since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese entities investment in overseas ports have accelerated both in terms of scale and numbers. This map shows Chinese entities have invested in 129 port projects, totalling over $60 billion from Tanzania and Australia to Nigeria and Cambodia. This dwarfs investments made by any other country. There is no US government initiative that tries to finance or build port projects overseas. China has an entire ecosystem of companies from cement firms, iron steel firms that specialize in building out ports. Those are not industries where the U.S. has been focused in recent years. But the level of Chinese ownership over its ports varies. China's global network is made up of a series of different forms of ownership by Chinese state run companies and also Chinese private companies. In most cases, they team up with multinational or local companies to build and run the ports, even though the land is still owned by local governments. 17 of the ports China has invested in have majority Chinese ownership, which could offer Beijing more leverage at those sites, such as prioritizing container ships from a certain country or denying the docking of ships from other countries. But China has little reason to disrupt global trade. Which takes us back to the first megaport we mentioned at Junkee in Peru. 60% is owned by China's state run shipping company COSCO, and 40% by an entity controlled by an Argentine investor. Chiang Guy is located around 40 miles north of Lima, and in its final phase, the main area of the ports is expected to be around 700 acres, which is about 80% the size of Central Park. So the port itself is huge. This port is part of China's large infrastructure push in Latin America. Currently, three out of four of the biggest economies of South America, a trade war with China than the U.S.. In fact, a third of all the containers exported by Peru are sent to China, carrying not only these favorites, but other agricultural products and minerals as well. So this makes Peru a crucial gateway into China for Brazil, Chile and other countries. The initial investment was of $1.3 billion. But if there's more demand, Costco has said that it could invest $3.5 billion total for an expansion of the port. Chiang Kai is a deep water port, which means that shipments can take place directly from Shanghai to major Chinese ports. So that would enable journeys to be cut down, costs to be reduced, trade to be increased between South America and China. US officials have criticized this for telling Peruvian authorities that they should not have allowed a Chinese firm to create such a big investment in the region. But Peruvian officials have countered, saying that the US hasn't been willing to make such a big investment in Peru. As we know by now, this is not just a story about overseas investment. It's also about national security. A number of Trump officials have even suggested that the port could be dual use, meaning that at some stage it could be used not just for economic activity, but for military activity, too. That's something that Peruvian officials strongly deny and that China denies, too. But these concerns are not unfounded. Well, U.S. intelligence says China's first overseas military base in the tiny African country of Djibouti is likely to be followed by several more in Djibouti. What began as a commercial port eventually turned into China's first full fledged overseas military base. Remember this map of the 17 ports with Chinese majority ownership, 14 have potential for both commercial and military use, meaning it can a service of commercial ships, LNG tankers, oil tankers. And it might also have the physical capacity to host fueling ships, logistics, ships for military purposes or a military battleship. China only has one overseas naval base so far as compared to the several that the US has dotted around the world. In fact, the U.S. also has a naval base in Djibouti, along with at least 127 other overseas military bases. Chinese officials strongly denied that the ports are for military use. But still, many countries around the world are concerned that these Chinese port operators could in turn become listening posts to what the economies that are surrounding these ports are doing. But the more immediate concern is that China could leverage these ports in a trade war. China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back. For the U.S. the Panama Canal is really a crucial economic lifeline. Something like 5% of global trade travels through the canal and 40% of U.S. contain the traffic flows through it. Without that ability to easily pass between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans through that corridor, U.S. trade will be very much impacted. Two of the ports on either side of the canal are owned by Hong Kong based conglomerate S.K. Hutchison. To all intents and purposes, Beijing doesn't have direct control over Hutchinson. But the very fact that the key executives at these companies may have direct relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, that really makes a lot of Western governments uncomfortable. A foreign power today possesses through their companies, which we know are not independent. The ability to turn the canal into a choke point, and that is a direct threat to the national interests and security of the United States. China has said that it has always respected Panama's sovereignty over the canal and that it firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices. Yet it has also pushed back against a deal that would give control of Hutchinson's Panama ports to American asset manager BlackRock, calling the deal a betrayal of national interests. The European Union has introduced investment screening regulations which make it much more difficult for China to buy out critical infrastructure, including ports across the continent. A tit for tat over docking fees has also been rippling through the shipping industry. Washington has also suggested that all this Chinese money comes with heavy strings attached. But if you talk to officials in Nigeria, Peru, beyond, there's a feeling that, look, we need this infrastructure. It's important for our economic modernization plans. And China is the only game in town offering it. Ultimately, we're going to see a reshaping of global trade flows because maritime trade has become more and more political. Enjoy that. Yeah, fantastic stuff. And work, of course, out of our team at Bloomberg Originals as subscribers, by the way, can watch that specific one and others, of course, on the terminal it's also on the website on Bloomberg dot com. China has certainly emerged as one of the key markets this year. That's imports do of course catch and read up on sure these call them today a fantastic one. Repeat after me. Never ever underestimate China of course in terms of what happened this year. Trade war, air developments, everything in between. The latest article in Focus is on why one should not undertake that exercise. You can read about that on terminals. Well also on the Bloomberg dot com. Right. Welcome back, Chips and Focus. Well, a couple of things is obviously. One is the US has, at least for now, pushed back the prospect of duties and that following, of course, the review. The second one comes down to what the security news reported late last night. And also, as you might see, in fact, raising some prices, some products by 10%. More on those stories coming through in the next hour of the China show. Welcome back. You're watching a China show half an hour into the Twas the Night Before Christmas, as they say. And certainly volumes are screaming that fact out when you look at turnover turning down volumes at this point in time of the day, we're about 48% lighter than than the month's average. Price swings are obviously going to be exacerbated. But that's just to say, of course, markets have effectively checked out for for the year. And it's been a really, really, really good year to be long. Major assets like stocks, precious metals. We get into all of that, of course, in the next hour of the China show. And of course, Bill is standing by in Sydney for us to help drive the ship in the next hour. Bell drive the ship for the last show before Christmas. And definitely here in Australia people have well and surely clocked off by now. But we are going to be bringing you all of the market moves over the coming hours and just starting us off in the session today. I mean it's it's pretty strong and and we have really eventually got that Santa Claus rally, it seems, just given what we had on Wall Street. It's translated eventually across to the Asian benchmarks in this session, with the exception actually of the ASX 200 standing out to the downside this morning. But it is that continued theme you see around tech, in particular metals and Vietnamese stocks. We're also tracking those ASX. You get the Vietnamese stocks first because as you were saying, Dave, I saw your email you sent earlier, this is by far the best performing benchmark globally. Over the past few weeks you're seeing gains of around 7%. But even in the session today, very strong moves and this is really perhaps a little bit more political clarity coming to the fore here because we may be soon set to get a new picture, a clear picture of the new top leaders for the country as well. Metals, as I mentioned, because very strong moves across the board in in the likes of copper, palladium, platinum, rather silver, gold. I mean you're seeing platinum record highs, silver above $70 an ounce at 4500 on gold spot as well, copper about 1200 thousand a tonne for the first time ever. Very strong moves really with these expectations around Fed easing into next year. There are some tariff risks as well that are coming to the fore, particularly for those copper prices but also taking a look in the currency space because again, as you said, Dave, you get that seen in trading, it leaves you open maybe to some more stronger moves. And the Korean one is maybe reflecting a bit of that today, but it is strengthening. And that's after authorities said excessive weakness in the currency is not desirable. So some strong determination to act. I mean, we didn't we just got that early this week as well with from the finance minister in Japan. But certainly you have those government officials in North Asia prepared to step in. Absolutely. In fact, Mark Cranfield is standing by for us to help us understand the context here in terms of what's happening broadly, of course, risk assets. And we talked about the markets and the complications suddenly of us looking elsewhere. Mark, we were talking about the we were looking elsewhere for intervention. Japan is a good example. We were talking about seven on the Chinese currency. And then the Koreans came out and said, hey, look at us. How do we need to be looking at this risk? Well, the Korean timing is very clever indeed, because they obviously were waiting to some extent for a for a change in the Japanese currency. The two are usually pretty closely linked together. So since we've already had Katayama, the finance minister, helping the yen to get a little bit stronger, the Korean authorities are following up. And the timing is also good because if you look at the the performance of the dollar against the Korean one over the past year, you'll see that when it gets close to the 1480 kind of area, which it is approaching today, that's a pretty important pivot area. And if they had allowed it just to drift even beyond that, by the time we come back in January, we could have a very weak currency indeed. And it might be beyond their control to do anything about it. So very important that they step in when they did. And if you look at the measures that they've announced today, that the key one is the one that's aimed at individual investors, there's been there's been talk for quite a while. The Koreans have been sending a lot of money to the US to buy tech stocks in America. It seems that the individuals in Korea, they love American big tech names, people like Tesla and India, all those kind of players. And there is so much money stored up in the US dollar via the equity market, the Korean authorities, and now encourage them to bring it back to Korea and do so at advantageous levels as well. So clearly it is very much aimed at getting money back into Korea to support the Korean currency. So very good timing from their point of view. So the chances of them drawing a line under the weakness in the currency is pretty good as they go into year end, and they should be able to start the new year on a much better footing than they would have done if they just allowed it to drift around. Let's talk about, I guess, some other implications of that weaker dollar story as well, because you've got gold that's about 4500 an ounce for the first time. What does that tell you and what's the direction for metals going into next year? Because a lot of these moves, I mean, again, at record levels. Yeah. I mean, that's a that's a double edged thing there. So General, US dollar weakness usually is good for precious metals, especially gold, but you're seeing it branch out way beyond this going into, as you say, into silver, platinum and other places as well. So on the one side is a dollar story, but on the other side, clearly geopolitics is playing a pretty big role as well. The fact that the United States and Venezuela, the situation there is pretty tense, could even deteriorate further. People are concerned about that. I think you still got a lot of unresolved issues in other parts of the world. There seems to be no sign that Russia and Ukraine are going to have a truce there either. So there's plenty of reasons when you look across the world, if people want to be nervous, if they want to be defensive, then obviously going into gold and other places is pretty good. And then you get the double whammy effect because the dollar is falling as well. And in the background, the treasury curve is pretty stable. And one of the few things that can derail the gold rally would be if suddenly we get a big jump in Treasury yields. That doesn't seem to be happening right now. People still think the Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates again next year. So all the conditions are very much in favor of gold and silver, staying on a pretty good track for the time being. Mark, I'm just taking a look at crypto prices and Bitcoin in particular. It's actually pretty incredible given all the optimism we had around crypto going into 2025 and the expectations of where it would end the year, it's actually managed to go lower by around 8%. What does that mean? I think if you if you've been following what we're saying on Markets Live for the past few months, crypto is a side story. I think people there's enough happening in major currencies, inequities in global fixed income markets. There's enough asset classes which are looking very, very interesting. Crypto is a sideshow. People are just moving their money away from it. It's increasingly becoming less relevant to what happens in the other markets. It's no longer really across asset story. It's out there on its own. There are people that like crypto. They want to be involved. The read across for other major assets is becoming less and less all the time. So with that background you can have crypto continuing to slide lower. And frankly, bond traders have exchanges. They don't really care. Really great love that mark that was out in life strategies that mark rounds out Cranfield rather in Singapore and I think just saying that there's a lot more interesting asset classes to attract leads us perfectly into our guest we've got Masahiko Lui joining us senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors Semester. I mean you just heard Mark telling us straight, there's there's just too many more captivating stories in in markets to grab traders and investors. What's most interesting for you in the fixed income space. I think fixed income space, right, is a Korean income story. We have seen a lot of, you know, sell off in fixed income, especially at the market. And e market, too, is a pretty interesting place to be for next year. And then there's a lot of talks about diversifying away, not divestment, again, from U.S. Treasuries right into different parts of the world. We have, you know, m as a substitute. We have seen investors, you know, willing to go. You have been investors trying to move in to a bit of foreign flows into JGBs actually lately. So I think you are going to next year fixed income is still a carry and income story and then with yield at this elevated level, I think it's a good entry point for investors with a long term investment perspective. So we're setting out maybe for a bit softer dollar story as well. What does that tell you about the preference for fit in versus down? I think for M market, you know, if you look at the total return year to date item, local currency has returned around 18% this year, one eight 18%. And if you look at something like global act, right, what we're aggregating throughout probably 8%, which is more carry and roll. And the reason why, you know, m local debt has outperformed is because of the all the weakness. We do think that, you know, with a slightly dovish fit into next year, we etc. we actually had a pretty consensus call of for cuts in 24 and 25. We had three cuts. This is from our chief economist Simona based in Boston. She had a pretty good call this year right. Despite all the ups and downs in the market where people pull back that rate cuts forecast, we stuck we stuck to our guns and then into next year we do forecast, you know, 2 to 3 more cuts off from the fat, you know, and that will probably impart a slightly weaker, you know, US dollar, maybe 5 to 7% weaker from here. And I think in the world, you know where you have Goldilocks growth and then a slightly weaker dollar and that will actually benefit him local currency debt as a whole, especially when you know a lot of this global investors, remember, they are very, very they are still underweight, you know, under emerging market debt. So it is an asset class that is underground. It pays high real yield. And then, you know, that's more room to appreciate versus the US dollar. Fantastic myself. Of course, we'll have more from Masahiko Lu in a moment there. We've largely had a look back at this year and sees some mighty supports some of the areas of the market that he likes going into next year. We're underweight globally, of course, as you can see across the fixed income space, high yield has done better than most. Does that continue to be the case in 2026? More on the outlook coming up next. This is the China shop. All right. Welcome back. You're watching the China Show, our final full broadcast, by the way, of the year. So it's Christmas. And let me let me find a way to crowbar my favorite Christmas movie of all time. And the conversations around to Fed. Might more FOMC members turn out to be doves? Actually. Masahiko Lu is still with us, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors Mazda. Thanks for sticking around. I think you just mentioned in the previous segment two or three rate cuts for next year. Almost everywhere has done well across the fixed income space, high yield and everything in between. When you look at consensus right now and you look at what markets most people are expecting, what could go wrong? I think next year, you know, the things that might go wrong is, you know, we do have like a bubble burst, albeit this is not our base scenario. Theme for next year is uncomfortably bullish. So we are still alone in risk assets and we do want to have some hedge do right. So if you have that, you know, a small bubble burst or we call it a momentum crash rather than burst. And and then there's also talks about your own carry treatment and one which is I don't think we will see that we might see a bit of, you know, periodically volatility but it's not the system is systemic or structural risk that that policy. So if we do have that, you know, small turmoil in the market, that's when, you know, risk assets will do worse. Right. And then that's when know hedges will come in and do well. And that's why we have seen investors, you know, locking into having traits that, you know, they are long risk like equities. And then, you know, if you long see, for instance, the short end of the US curve is a pretty good player. If, you know, risks plunge and fat wall will cut. Right. So that's a pretty good place to be for fixed income has its place, albeit not in the longer and a curve but the short end of the curve. And how does asset class or you know like fixed income that's has cheapened up a lot like GBS for instance. Right. If you do have a change in sentiment, I think that, you know, rewind that reversal would be pretty quick. And also, you know, you can sit on assets like, hey, just like gold, you know, and convertible bonds, right? We have seen actually investors, especially in the in European investors taking chips off a bit, you know, when it comes to US equities, right. Growth equities. And then if you are in converts, you do have that upside in equities and also you do have a downside protection of a bond. Like that's a tough time protection, right? So that's why we have seen, you know, a lot of industrials trying to have have hedges on. What fantastic advice, I think. Can I just pick up on one of the points you just made? It's the short end. So I think we've seen three straight years of the US curve specifically steepening. Do you see anything that upsets that, that that trend is are we going to get a fourth year steepening? I think we will get a fourth year of steepening into next year. You know, albeit, you know, a flattening is probably more of a 2027 story. Right. Even in Japan is the flattening is going to be a late 20, 26 story. But I think, you know, globally, you still have a lot of fiscal slippage and a lot of issuance in the longer end of the curve. You know, that be us Germany, including Japan's euro where I sit in. Right. And that's why we think that the curve is remains distorted albeit you know there's a lot of fixes or like tweaks being done. You know like you know you can cut a bit of the issuance on the back and issue more you know in the bill strikes or cut coupons and issue bills. A lot of this you know technical things can happen that could contain the steepness of the curve. But, you know, in general sense, I think a lot of people aren't comfortable sitting on a shot and then having to price a bit of term premium into the longer end. Yeah, I guess that's also a reflection around the yield curve outlook, just as of a lot of the spending that's tied to the big, beautiful bill that's going to kick in. And a lot of what we see in terms of CapEx investments as well as an investor in more of the corporate space. Is there any concern about some of those those bonds that are tied to air specifically? Sure. At State Street Investment management, you know, we actually we favor sovereign bonds over credit for the next year. Right. The reason why is because, you know, we have seen a lot of issuance, you know, funding aspiration of HYPERSCALERS in CapEx. And that will I think will drive, you know, spreads higher into next year, especially focusing on the type names that will basically drive, you know, spreads when it comes to like for instance, US IG rate is trading around 80 basis points, 75, 80 basis points at almost at all time tight. Right. We think, you know, the general travel direction of travel is to get spread a bit wider maybe, you know, 200, 120 when it comes to high yield, it's trading at 25 currently is also at all times tight. So, you know, there's only so much, you know, room for it to rally from here further to tighten further. So we do think that, you know, if we do have a bit of more cockroaches in the market per se and then more issuance, that will basically put on some pressure in the credit market. So we are favoring sovereign debt over credit and then we also favor M local that and other, you know, hedges like coal and converts. What about the the Japan debt market as well because I can see in your notes is saying JGBs look pretty cheap but sentiment does still remain pretty cautious as well. This is something very interesting talking to foreign investors. So me sitting in Japan so I cover impact on do travel to you know in the US and Europe from time to time talking to investors. You know, you have seen two types of investors right. Domestic and foreign foreign investors, they are getting more attracted to GGP market, albeit a lot of the money that flows into Japan from foreign is still in the fast money or you know that the ones that are active more tactical type of investors. We do sense that you know there's more and more of this the real real money right there, like the likes of the sovereign wealth funds, like your pension funds in the U.S.. Right. That has never been looking at JGB for the past three years because it's going at 0% right now. Suddenly it's yielding at par with Germany 30 years. Right. And then if you're a foreign investor, as you head you back to, you know, your foreign your own currency, home currency, you actually get the hedging premium, which is around one 200 to 200 basis points, you know, of of of attractiveness. And as a domestic investor in Japan, no one wants to catch a falling. Naturally, Japan banks are sitting on a lot of cash, ¥400 trillion of cash. Right. Those are the money that will be deployed in the job market. But speaking to investors in Japan, we have started to see this pick up of up interest. But then it is going to take a long, drawn process. You know, they have to wait until BOJ gets to closer to the terminal, which is we think round one 125 by early 2027. So, you know JGB that you get the structural buying from Japanese investors will be a 2026 later health story but you know before we get there you know a lot of entry points for investors to to to to get in when especially when the market you know GGP market sell off under a headline of increase issuance of fiscal slippage for us we think that you know Takeuchi if she has a choice I don't think she wants to be distressed right. I think she's going to be. MALONEY Like, you know how Italy has outperformed the market. I'm going I'm coming into this several quarters. Yeah, that seems to be an easy, easy choice of preference, let's put it that way. Can I just I mean, perfect, perfect segue way for. The JGB market, the KGB's. So obviously we've seen this yield yields cross because of the sort of Japan normalizing interest rates, the lack of inflation in China on our screens for our viewers. Must you say 2026 will be will be the becomes the verdict year on China's ability to exit deflation? Two part question Do you think they will exit deflation? And if they do, what's the trade? And by the way, third question why 2026? I think 25 freight has seen, you know, like look at the chart. Right. This is pretty surprising. I like to me is a Baltic expression. Baltic Chinese yield is trading underneath Japan. Right. Jiji It's actually doing one two GBS right. And I think 23 five is the year that, you know, investors have shifted away from thinking this segment of Asia is actually Japan for the past 30 years. Right now, once you know Japanese yield is next, nothing right now Japan is actually doing a lot better. There's a lot of foreign inflows in both JGBs and also Nikkei equities. Right. And if you talk to a lot of foreign investors, they are very actually pretty bullish when it comes to Japan, especially when it comes to macro growth and stuff. But shifting to China, I think, you know, is actually there's a lot of similarities, a bit of differences between Japan and China and what sitting in China, I'm looking at I'm sorry, sitting in Japan looking at China, I could see China is mimicking Japan back in the 1990, early 2000, right where Japan was in the early stage in this was going to last decades, I think 2026 is the verdict year because, you know, we have seen China's inflation improving a bit. Right. But still, you know, is still in a deflationary stage. And there's a lot of targeted spending, targeted growth initiatives done by the government. And 2026, you know, if anything we think is going to be a pivot in a year for them, if they could actually actually deflation and also induce a bit of growth in the market into its economy. But, you know, having putting every piece into the puzzle, we do think that, you know, trying to asset is still a pretty is is going to take a pretty long time for China right to to actually actually exit that whole deflationary and also growth on the mining mindset just because of how look in Japan right you have the demographics aging society and you have elevated debt And then the third one is, you know, secular decline in potential growth. China is doing better than Japan, right? Because they do have, you know, 45% potential growth. But then, you know, is there will be a lot of pressure, external pressure, too, on China. And we think that, you know, CGP is actually attractive trade to be whenever there is a sell off taking you know from the experience of Japan and Jeju market. Thank you, sir. Have a good rest of your week and holidays ahead myself. Masahiko Lu, the senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Tokyo, writes, We'll leave you with a look at markets and then we'll see you on the other side of this break. Welcome back. And some of the corporate stories that we're tracking this morning. We're watching Senate shares. That's after it announced a major oilfield discovery in the Bohai Sea. Sinovac says that Qinhuangdao 29, Dash six, holds 100 million tons of oil with the discovery well producing 2500 barrels of crude a day. China's Comac is set to miss its annual delivery target for a sea 919 single aisle jet by almost 50%. Data from Cirium and plane spotters dot net suggest Comac shipped just 13 of its flagship plane this year, well short of the target of 25 Planemakers expected to have received the SI 919 this year, including Air China and China Eastern. All right. Let's have a look at these markets. Chips and focus SMI here the news yesterday out of the that's near these times and that dovetails really into the well the well first the jump in the shares clearly and some prices and some products by 10% make the entry model Qualcomm. Sam is also on the up here, 1.2%. Taiwanese insurers also in focus today on the back of some changes in, I guess effects and that should be leading to some gains not all but we are coming off highs, if not completely reversing in some cases on some changes in accounting rules. Right. We'll take a short break and have a look at the Japanese. Close the market close in a moment. This is Bloomberg. It's 11:29 a.m. in Tokyo this morning. Japanese markets just about to go into their lunch break. We're not really seeing too much trading activity and we're seeing holiday thin trading across the board. No surprises. Why? Of course, it is Christmas Eve, but still, we are just seeing stocks inching marginally higher and that's after we had some pretty strong GDP figures out of the US overnight. That set us up nicely and played in again to that Wall Street session. Asian markets as well. Let's take a look at what's happening across the board today. As we said, it's it's very light in terms of of news stories, but still it's just some incremental moves here to the upside, still seeing that continued outperformance of tech there. And of course, the commodities rally is the other big story that we're tracking here, Dave. Yeah, it really is. In fact, we're going to get into that in a moment. I would really you know, as recently as a few weeks back, I thought we were kind of done with the rally. And then the last week happened and, you know, here we are, 45 and gold, 4500 silver, 72, platinum, copper, 12,000 of equity markets. Just very quickly, of course, in case you want to take if you're keeping tabs, best year since these years on your screens. Clearly, the Cosbys had a standout year. I think it's the best performing major benchmark globally and yet they're clearly the best on price this this this this century. In fact, the and the rethinking of its role specifically not so much as a tech play. That's been a that's been a consistent theme for for many years with the page but as a really vital cog to the air supply chain. God there we go. It's been you know, the fact that you have an underperformer, that the fact that gold has seen 50 record highs and it's still one of the underperformance relative to others like Silver just tells you how good, how good things have really been. BELL Yeah. And let's get more on that gold story. And commodities generally bring in our Bloomberg Metals and Mining reporter Martin Ritchie in Shanghai. So, Martin, was this something you had thought would be the case, would see 40 $500 an ounce by the end, by the end of the year? And and how does that set us up into next year when you still got more bullish calls saying 4840 900 is even possible. Yeah, it's been a pretty spectacular year for for gold. And since you asked for that. One of my colleagues was mentioning this morning that when he covered gold, you know, you could never imagine prices this level even two years ago. But here we are. And I think this December rally that you've seen in gold and in the precious metals is really a continuation of the same themes we've seen throughout this year. It's about. It's about the debasement. Trade is the growing sort of mistrust in traditional assets, the sovereign bonds and currencies. It's about the weaker dollar. It's a bit central banks buying gold because of those things, and it's about a little bit more private investor money coming into gold. But you have all that and then you have kind of low liquidity in the in the end of year season, which means that these kind of momentum trades can can take hold and spreads to other metals. We've obviously seen silver, platinum, palladium, all these precious metals that are very small markets and can make very big moves. We've seen those start to make pretty spectacular moves, in fact, in the last few days. Yeah. And you know, when they use a spectacular could sometimes be an understatement. It tells you how good things have been. Martin Leap Let's talk about copper. Obviously, the we all know about the supply issues there, the big the three big copper biggest copper mines in the world. Where is there? Well, when I look at the economic forecast for next year and this is the economic overlay, people seem to have a mixed view on whether the global economy will do better next year compared to this year. And I wonder whether there is an economic consideration when you look at Dr. Copper doing what it's doing to the upside. I would I would. I see this opportunity to talk a little bit about the downside for for for copper. You know, we're seeing this we're seeing this rally to 12,000 well past 12,000 already. And we're seeing this happening even as demand for copper is is quite weak, especially here in in China. We've seen over the past two months a really quite marked slump in demand and supply driven rallies, especially when they're driven by a kind of time limited thing like the prospect of us import tariffs are maybe not that reliable and is already a lot of people saying that 12,000 is just too high for copper. It's it's higher than where it should be relative to demand. If we look globally at supply, the market is not that tight. It's it's only because there's a lot of stuff going to the US two front run tariffs that you're getting this sort of slightly distorted sense of where prices are. So those are all reasons to be kind of a little bit more cautious. A guess about about next year with copper at these already very high levels. MARTIN Thank you. Mark Rich in in Shanghai for us, our metals and mining reporter there. Right. Just ahead here, we're having some when we talk about a closer look, really a close and deeper and comprehensive look at Seattle specifically. So the company has taken on new heights this year. It's setting its sights then on further expansion overseas. But there are some speed bumps and bottlenecks ahead, including politicians and Donald Trump in the way. Details on that story just ahead. This is Bloomberg. You're watching the China show and taking a look at some stocks that are moving very strongly to the upside today. These are smart driving stocks listed in on the mainland. But but the story here and the reporting we're actually getting from Xinhua is that the that Beijing city has issued the first batch of license plates for all three autonomous vehicle operating on expressways. Now, to put it in perspective, L three technology, it's when the technology of the vehicle becomes significantly more autonomous. So at this point, maybe you can have a car that can really perform all driving tasks at some point, maybe where humans can start to recline a little bit in their seats and focus on other tasks. That's what the technology is capable of. A step below what you see Robotaxis operating at today, which is L4 but definitely above L2. The way we see in terms of basic adaptive cruise control lane centering other sorts of technologies as well. Dave, you know, when you mentioned L2, and I think a lot of people will well appreciate this jump in my in my head it's l2l3l4. It just makes me think about my discs and my lower back. Right. So L4 L5 a lot of people have heard her animations and I'll just borrow of course, people people like me. We do need, of course, reclining seats when you do have bad backs, right, Because they alleviate some of the pressure on your L4, L5 sometimes even that's one OC anyway. That's okay. Let me. How did I get myself into this corner? Let me pull myself out of this hole and then pivot back, get back on the road. Talk about Seattle, the world's biggest EV maker, with a fantastic big take today on this. Get this, the company has powered one in three cars sold this year. That's according to data from South Korean based energy research. But as growth slows domestically, the company is now looking abroad for expansion. Let's bring in our transport reporter here, Linda Loo, to talk us to today's big take. Let's talk about, pun intended, the road ahead and the road overseas here for the company before we talk about the challenges. Yeah. So Seattle is making a really big push into Europe as already built two factories, one in Germany, one in Hungary where it's producing batteries to supply to us clients like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes on the continent is building a third factory in partnership with Stellantis and Spain. So it's really ramping up presence in Europe. What's in the way and the way is a uneven demand. You're seeing that in China. You're also seeing a little bit of that In Europe. We just saw the EU essentially kind of scale back the commitments to phasing out sales of petrol and diesel cars by in the near future. So that step back, combined with some of European countries like Germany and France scaling back incentives to support EV purchases, could in the long run kind of slow down this demand for EVs. But I think Seattle is banking that the transition towards EVs will might be uneven, but it's not going away. So is really putting its production capacity on the line there. What can it do in terms of containing costs as it looks to expand, then, if it really doesn't have any other choice but continue to look to your really. Yes, that's right. Europe has a really important market for car sales, as well as EVs outside of China. You're probably seeing the biggest source of demand from the European continent. And another big factor is the higher prices that even makers can command in Europe. So that's really going to help boost the margins of these manufacturers, especially considering at home there's a price war that's being waged for the Chinese companies. So Seattle is also hoping to capitalize on some of those higher margins in Europe. On the flip side, as factories that's operating in Germany, maybe possibly Hungary is actually at a lower efficiency and probably at a higher cost compared to factories at home in China. So it's kind of a balancing act that needs to address as it develops. And the European markets, not so much a focus, I guess, for this piece, but just generally, can you help us understand as well for next year for Seattle, the the importance of of energy storage systems as well to the business, given you've got maybe some weaker or more mature demand already for the EV battery side. Yes, Energy storage systems is actually a market that a lot of people are banking on for fast growth, especially now as the demand for API and data centers are surging. So having these storage systems, I think these data centers will really help manage the energy demands that these operations will have. So Seattle has already made a lot of groundwork and foundations for producing energy solar storage systems, not only in China but in the US is actually very interesting. They are pivoting together with Ford to go into this energy storage energy storage systems market with Ford hoping to leverage the licensing deal it has, or Seattle to start providing those type of products. That's actually an area that you have if you make makers like Tesla already very strong and in the space. So it'll be really interesting to see how Seattle can kind of gain a little bit of access into the US market through partnerships like this. Linda, great reporting. That was Bloomberg's Linda Liu there in Hong Kong talking about today's big take, which is China's battery giant needing new markets after dominating at home. And on that point and continuing Seattle we actually spoke to earlier this year and the company told us that it's making overseas expansions its top priority in light of what Linda was saying. But amid an intense for domestic competition, its chief manufacturing officer spoke with Stephen Engle, our chief North Asia correspondent at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin early this year. Irrational competition. I will call it everyone but industrywide. And the government knew this is a problem in this House. This will destroy the industry. So there is a lot of a sentiment to come up with a regulation and a policy to prohibit this kind of price war. And as a result, that also forced everybody to dig in. Can you further improve your internal efficiency and so maintain reasonable business margin to survive, to continue to innovate? So for that part doubt, I expect there will. How are you doing that? How are you? We are proving good efficiency. We are trying to do everything improve the production utilization. How is I employed? They asked me used to actually see it has been using embracing the air revolution maybe seven, eight years ago. At that time it really started from simple repetitive task and manual work. They tried to use air to capture, to do more efficient work, and now we not only use AI to screen the material because the different material, different chemistry and also different design, and also during the stage of manufacturing and also after the sales. So air has been utilized to improve and make sure the processes are stable is in the control. Over the next 5 to 10 years, what would your ideal. Next generation super battery factory look like? Well, I would say in the next five years, ideally, let's take on all the trade barriers. All the consideration ideally should be green, number one, because we want to save our planet. The factory we actually already do extensive improvement. We reduce our energy consumption, reduce any of the emission and circulate any of the waste of material we recirculate into our production. That is number one. Number two, it should be a smart so that any human labour intensive, dangerous task should be taken care by machines, by robots, by computers. So that's what we are saying also should be reconfigurable, because when you put that down, this is a capital intensive facility where you put the production line you don't want to see, oh, after year the product, the end product, our consumer, our customers, the vehicle don't sell well. So we would like to switch that to a different vehicle. But can you quickly flexibly adjust, adapt to the new product? So that's our effort. We tried to make it as a user friendly as possible. How do you avoid the pitfalls of overcapacity that is affected the solar industry right now? And a lot of people in the industry are fearing that maybe there's going to be a battery overcapacity in the coming years. How do you feel about. Well, we don't look at that. We believe it when the global community going to a green sustainable award and there's a surge, the demand is drastically increasing. The key is a high quality battery. Of course, you can't if you don't put that high standard, you can put a cheap battery. That capacity maybe is are plentiful. But the consumer and our basically a workhorse OEM in the car industry energy company, they demand a high quality save and a long life battery for that it's there's a shortage. Otherwise we would not go to many parts of the world to make those high quality batteries. Would you say going overseas now because of the high demand demand? Well, there's obviously I wouldn't say the market is saturated in China yet, but there's a price war, obviously, which is brutal. Would you say, though, that your number one priority is kind of figuring out the international expansion, that sort of the best, I guess, algorithm for making it work? Is that your number one priority? Yes. And that was in June there. The chief manufacturing officer at the company with exclusively with a colleague, Stephen Engle. That conversation was back a few months back. The safety has really been and staying largely on theme here, it really has been a major concern for the industry this year following a fatal crash of a show me car that then led to a nationwide uproar. Steve also had a look at the story. He took a test track, took to a test track in Shanghai where Seattle is looking to make charging faster and also safer. Seattle likes to think of itself as doing sort of the dirty work of building electric vehicles, not only where the rubber meets the road, but where the charge is put into the chassis. Seattle's so-called skateboards are a modular cell to chassis product that integrate the battery cells under the floorboards with the chassis engine, drive, train and other modules. Seattle's many car brand customers then build out their own flashy bodies on top, and this stripped down and top off skateboard skeleton is not just for show. It rips on the test track. Our test drive took place just as Seattle touted it can now offer 520 kilometres or 323 miles of range from an industry best just 5 minutes of charging time. Total game changer. Because with that technology and then the infrastructure that follows behind it, range anxiety should be a thing of the past. Seattle has more than one third of the world's EV battery manufacturing capacity. They can scale it. Analysts say this will be the year in China when EVs finally outsell internal combustion engine passenger cars for the first time. But tragedy also has recently accompanied that rapid growth. In late March, a shammy SUV, seven traveling at high speed on an expressway with self-driving reportedly switched on, plowed into a concrete wall and caught fire, killing three people. The Shell Me accident really put the focus on EV safety, not only with autonomous driving, but with battery safety. This is the Seattle first generation of the skateboard chassis. Underneath are the batteries. The next generation called the bedrock, is promising at least 120 kilometers an hour. Frontal impact will not cause a fire or explosions. Also known as thermal runaway. Greater oversight safety will become a priority for a lot of these homes. They're all talking about it here. I think the problem with the way the self-driving technology features have been solved is it's caused people to think that they could be less attentive to the way the car is actually performing. You still need to monitor the car for putting the onus on battery makers to to make sure such a high impact thermal event won't lead to a fire. For one, is championing advancements in less combustible sodium ion batteries, which Catl says are ready for commercialization, though. Well, this reporter is ready for perhaps just one more spin around the track. Stephen Engle Bloomberg News Check. And we're going to continue the discussion, rather, on Chinese sector in the next hour. We'll have a battery analyst, you and me, from Great Will Securities and also the automobile City founder and CEO Bill Russo, who you just saw in that tape. But Bill Russo joining us as well. You can catch that interview at The Times on your screen. This is Bloomberg. Right. Welcome back. Just before we wrap up the show today, just a glance at markets in Vietnam, some weakness today. We were up as much as 1%, if not more. In the opening minutes, have since clearly pared back and still one of the best performers. In fact, I'd say it's the best performing index over the past five days on political clarity is what we're pointing to at this point in time. Right up on the up still. We're looking at gold. Of course, that's really been a big story. Gold stocks specifically when you look at Indonesia. There we go on your screen some of the big mining related names as gold continues to hit new highs. Just before we wrap up, a quick glance at the Hang Seng index and also some benchmarks to its reminder that we are a day to Christmas and we have some early closures of these markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and also in New Zealand, which is already shots, a truncated sessions there. And since this is our final full broadcast of the year, let me just take the opportunity to wish you all well a happy holiday. Thank you for joining us. Not just today, but for this year so far. We will see you all in full in the new year for the economy. Spend a bit of money for your future self. Maybe don't spend everything, but of course, spend a lot of time, if you can, with your loved ones from us here at the China show. We wish you all well. We'll see you all in the New year.

The announcement came after the US Food and Drug Administration surprisingly rejected Sanofi’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug tolebrutinib. Bloomberg’s Ashleigh Furlong reports.", "content": "00:00\n\nIs this still a surprise for Sanofi? Very much so, because we're seeing this situation obviously where vaccines globally, we were seeing sort of a hit to vaccine sales. Sanofi itself has said at the last quarter that its vaccine sales were down. In the US we have a Health Secretary, Robert F Kennedy, who is almost systematically undermining some of the tenets of vaccines really. But what we have seen is that's mainly targeting childhood vaccinations and this deal is mainly focused on adult immunizations. So I'm assuming that that said, Sanofi is hoping that adult immunizations are protected from those changes that we're seeing in the U.S.. And obviously, you know, this deal will well might take sort of, you know, several years to sort of show show true value for the company. So, you know, we might see changes in the in the rules around vaccines, but in the coming years in the U.S.. Okay. So actually, that's the vaccine story around Sanofi today. Sanofi has also said that the US FDA rejected its drug for multiple sclerosis. What does that setback mean for the French drugmaker? So this is a significant blow. We already in a way expected difficulties with the submission and the FDA had already delayed the to the decision date and we were expecting this potentially come next year. It's surprising this has come so quickly. And and it's also a significant blow potentially to two patients who with a specific type of M.S., which have few options. But for Sanofi, which is really trying to replace its leading drug, DUPIXENT, and that's coming generics are coming in in the next couple of years for that drug. And this this this mass drug was supposed to sort of help it on its way to just sort of replace those revenues. So this rejection in the U.S. is going to be significant for it. And Sanofi seems to hope that, you know, there's a way still a way forward and that it's still discussing with us, with the FDA. But obviously, it is a significant blow. This was the potential for 1.7 billion USD in annual revenue, which would, you know, we the sales will only potentially come from the rest of the world now.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:02 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T09:38:24.937038"}

The UK oil giant will divest a 65% stake, retaining the remaining interest via a joint venture. Bloomberg’s Mitchell Ferman reports.", "content": "00:00\n\nHow big a deal is this, then, for BP and for Stonepeak? Good morning. Yeah, BP reset its strategic direction earlier this year and part of that reset was announcing a $20 billion divestment program. Castrol its lubricants business was the central divestment target for for that program. And the expectations were that this asset could could bring BP as much as 0 billion. And and so, you know, as we as we see today, they sold a majority stake in it for about 6 billion. And obviously, Mitchell, good morning. We know that BP is undergoing this transition period, is getting a new CEO in Meg O'Neill. Does this sale mean that BP can streamline its portfolio as much perhaps, as Elliott wants it to do? Yeah, Good morning. It's you know, it definitely achieves a target that BP set out earlier this year. However, a lot has changed since BP set out that target right there. There is a new chairman. You know, you're talking about Novo Nordisk. There was a bit of a through line with BP. The chairman that departed both BP and Novo this year was Helgoland. And and his replacement at BP is And he is, as you say, he is made quick work with with the CEO change and And so there are still a lot of questions now about about the direction of BP. Yes. And think let's think about those into 2026 then Mitchell. I mean, this is a business that had what mishandled. Is that the way we describe it, a pivot towards renewables. Now it's going to be under a new management team. I mean, is this a sort of back to basics oil business? Is that where we're going? That's what it appears, right? The new chairman said that he wants a simpler, leaner BP. And clearly, And so Meg O'Neill, who starts in April, well, will have to lay out a vision that, you know, could go a number of directions. But the thing that is clear is that it will be an oil and gas vision. And do you think there will be more h.r. Personnel changes under meg o'neill's leadership than if it's going to be a serious pivot, hopefully successful pivot for them this time under her leadership. Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of unanswered questions. Staff internally, as we reported on bloomberg late last week. Staff is is uncertain about about what's happening right now, what's going to happen. They have gone through years of transformations, of strategic pivots, and now they have another another pivot. Murray didn't even have a year or two to kind of carry out his his plan. And now they're going to have a new CEO come in. Most people internally at BP were shocked by this kind of sudden announcement. That shock is probably what investors were were looking for to some degree. But as a result, there are a lot of questions about what's next. And and Meg will have to answer those in due time.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:17:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T09:38:25.220653"}

SHERRY SAID PPR A LITTLE HIGHER, TRADING HIGHER AFTER THE OIL GIANT AGREED TO SELL A MAJORITY STAKE IN ITS LUBRICANTS DIVISION TO THE U.S. INVESTMENT FIRM SANPETE PARTNERS TO RAISE ABOUT $6 BILLION. JOINING US FOR MORE IS A BIG OIL REPORTER MITCHELL FURMAN WHO IS WITH US THIS CHRISTMAS EVE AND HERE TO BREAK DOWN THE STORY. WE HAVE GOT SOME NEWS TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS GOOD I'M PERHAPS WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE A SLOW NEWS DAY. HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS THIS? > > GOOD MORNING. IT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF BP'S 20 BILLION KNOWLEDGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY, STRATEGIC RESET TO MOVE AWAY FROM ITS FAILED LOW CARBON BETS AND BACK TO OIL AND GAS. PART OF THAT WAS DIVESTING $20 MILLION OF ASSETS TO APPROVE THE BALANCE SHEET AND REVERSE YEARS OF UNDERPERFORMANCE IN WHICH THE GAP BETWEEN BP AND ITS COMPETITORS HAS WIDENED. ANNA: DOES THAT MEAN THIS CASTROL SALE, BP CAN STREAMLINE ITS PORTFOLIO? THIS HAS BEEN THE AREA OF FOCUS FROM A PARTICULAR ACTIVIST INVESTOR WHO IS HAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF IMPACT AT BP. > > THIS DOES MAKE SOME HEADWAY IN IN BP'S PORTFOLIO. CASTROL, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN IN BP'S PORTFOLIO THIS CENTURY SINCE IT ACQUIRED IT 25 YEARS AGO, THE ASSET WAS NOT AS FULLY INTEGRATED AS OTHER PARTS OF THE BUSINESS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS BP, WHILE IT IS A MASSIVE OIL AND GAS PRODUCER, IT IS ALSO A MAJOR COMMODITIES TRADER. AND CASTROL WAS NEVER REALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE TRADING BUSINESS LIKE BP'S REFINERIES AND UPSTREAM ASSETS AND PIPELINES WHICH IS TRADERS CAN USE TO OPTIMIZE. CASTROL NEVER REALLY PLAYED IN THAT WAY. SO IT ALLOWS BP TO KIND OF FOCUS ON PARTS OF THE BUSINESS WHERE IT CAN'T OPTIMIZE ITS TRADING ADVANTAGES. ANNA: THAT IS WHY THIS MIGHT BE THE RIGHT ASSET SALE, MITCHELL. WHAT ABOUT OTHER ASSET SALES? THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROGRAM OF SELLING ASSETS TO GET BACK TO BASICS I SUPPOSE FOR THIS OIL BUSINESS. WHAT ARE WE EXPECTED IN 2026 ON THAT FRONT? > > YOUR QUESTIONS ARE AS GOOD AS ANYBODY'S BECAUSE THE NEW CHAIRMAN JUST LAST WEEK ANNOUNCED ABRUPTLY THAT THE CEO WHO ANNOUNCED THE STRATEGIC RESET IN FEBRUARY WILL BE DEPARTING AND MEG O'NEILL WOULD BE COMING IN AS CEO TO REPLACE HIM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MEG O'NEILL WANTS TO DO. WE KNOW CHAIRMAN WANTS BP TO PREPARE BETTER, WHAT'S A SIMPLER, LEANER BP THAT ACCELERATES THIS OIL AND GAS STRATEGY. BUT HOW EXACTLY BP GETS THERE REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND MEG O'NEILL WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS. SHE TAKES OVER APRIL 1. ANNA: MITCHELL, THANK YOU FOR THE BRIEFING. A LOT TO COVER BP IN 2026 NO DOUBT. JOEL FUHRMAN ON THE OIL NARRATIVE THIS MORNING. LET'S TURN TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR. SHARE SUBS TO KNOW IF HE ON THE MOOD THIS MORNING. FROM HER GRAVE TO BUY -- THE FIRM AGREED TO BUY FOR $2.2 BILLION IN A BID TO EXPEND ITS VACCINE PORTFOLIO. THE STOCK IS DOWN .3%. WE ARE JOINED BY ASHLEIGH FURLONG. IS IT SURPRISING THIS BUSINESS THAT SO NO DOING THIS DEAL FOR A VACCINE DEVELOPER RIGHT NOW? TALK US THROUGH THE LOGIC. > > IT IS INTERESTING. AT THE MOMENT WE SEE VACCINE SALES GLOBALLY DOWN. IN THE U.S., VERY SPECIFIC SCENARIO PLAY OUT. WE HAVE A HEALTH SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. THAT IS ALMOST SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINING MANY OF THE TENETS OF VACCINES BRINGING IN QUESTIONS AROUND VACCINE SAFETY. MANY ARE TARGETED AT CHILD HOOD IMMUNIZATIONS. SO POTENTIALLY THERE IS LESS OF A TENSION IN THE ADULT VACCINES BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING TYPE TO BE DOING A VACCINE STEEL GLOBALLY AND SANOFI ITSELF HAS SAID VACCINE SALES ARE NOT DOING AS WELL IS HOPED. ANNA: THAT IS INTERESTING ON THE VACCINE SIDE OF THINGS AND WHY MAKE THIS AT THIS POINT. ELSEWHERE IN THE SANTA FE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY SAID THE U.S. FDA HAS REJECTED ITS DRUG FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. WHAT DOES THAT KIND OF SETBACK MEAN FOR THIS FRENCH PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS? > > IT IS A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK. THE SHARES HAVE NOT REALLY REACTED THAT MUCH AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST BEEN PRICED IN ALREADY. WE SAW EARLIER THIS MONTH THE FDA DELAYED, SAID IT WAS GOING TO DELAY ITS DECISION ON THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DRUG AND ANALYST HAD ANTICIPATED THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A NEGATIVE REACTION. BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR A REALLY TRYING TO REPLACE ITS TOP-SELLING DRUG TO PICK SENT. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF REPLACING AND AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THAT $1.7 BILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE THAT WE HOPED FOR FOR THE DRUG IS UNDER QUESTION AND THEIR QUESTIONS AROUND WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO GET ANY OF THAT REVENUE IN THE COMING YEARS. ANNA: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. HAVE A GOOD BREAK. THE LATEST ON SANOFI. LET'S WIDEN THE LENS. STOCKS AND COMMODITIES HITTING RECORDS DUE TO POLITICAL TENSION AND DATA FROM THE UNITED STATES SHOWING THE ECONOMY EXPANDED AT ITS FASTEST PACE IN TWO YEARS. ALL OF THAT IS VERY MUCH IN THE BACKGROUND FOR ALL ASSET CLASSES RIGHT NOW. LET'S TURN TO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CREDIT MARKETS. JOSH FARBER IS WITH US FROM BNP PARIBAS. NICE TO SPEAK TO YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SPEAK TO US ON 24 DECEMBER NO LESS. WE HAVE A HOST OF THINGS AND PLAY RIGHT NOW. STOCKS ARE DOING REALLY WELL. METALS, COMMODITIES ARE DOING WELL. WHAT KIND OF OPTIMISM TO CREDIT MARKETS GO INTO 2026 WITH? WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK LOOK LIKE TO YOU? > > WE ARE BULLISH ON CREDIT AND WE THINK MOST ASSETS PRICE THAT BULLISHNESS, NOT ALL OF THEM DO, AND WE WANT TO LOOK TO BUY THE ASSETS THAT HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE RALLY. THE PLACE WE START IS HIGH-YIELD SINGLE BE. ANNA: WHY THE HIGH-YIELD? WHY NOT INVESTMENT GRADE? WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE HIGH-YIELD SPACE YOU THINK IS WORTH THE RISK AND PAYING YOU THE REWARD YOU NEED? > > GREAT QUESTION. THE FIRST POINT IS THAT THE RISK TO THE DOWNSIDE FROM LOWER GROWTH WE THINK HAS GONE AWAY. WE THINK THE PATH IS TOWARD A WARMER EUROPEAN ECONOMY LED BY GERMAN FISCAL AND HIGH-YIELD, PARTICULARLY EXPOSED TO INCREASING GROWTH. THE OTHER POINT IS HIGH-YIELD IS CHEAP. ESPECIALLY SINGLE B BECAUSE IT WAS UNFAIRLY TAINTED BY THE PRIVATE CREDIT DEFAULTS IN THE U.S. ANNA: INTERESTING. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN THE GERMAN FISCAL PUSH AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE CREDIT SPACE. IN GERMANY, THEY ARE LOADING UP OUR DEFENSE SPENDING AND ALSO DOING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. IS IT IN BOTH AREAS YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS TO PLAY OUT WELL FOR CREDIT OR MORE THE MOOD MUSIC AROUND THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING MORE AND THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT INTO THE GERMAN ECONOMY? > > IT IS THE -- FIRST OF ALL, IT IS THE POINT OF THE AGGREGATE GROWTH PICTURE IS STRONGER. IN HIGH-YIELD, WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT IS DO YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK? IT IS HARD TO HAVE DEFAULTS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING FASTER. THE SECOND POINT IS HAVING A GLUT OF BULLETINS, WHICH WERE NOT REALLY USED TO AND EUROPE, MEANS THE ASSETS WHICH COMPETE FOR BUNDS, RELATIVELY FEW ARE AROUND. AND THE SCARCITY POINT WE THINK PEOPLE WILL FLEE RATES AND GOING TO CREDIT. ANNA: WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET? WE SPENT A LOT OF THIS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STRESS IN FRANCE IN PARTICULAR AND SOME CORPORATE'S IN FRANCE CAN BORROW MORE CHEAPLY THAN THE SOVEREIGN FOR EXAMPLE NOW. WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS IN RELATION TO YOUR PREFERENCE FOR HIGH-YIELD IN EUROPE? > > WE THINK THE POINT IS THAT THERE IS ENOUGH GOVERNMENT BOND SUPPLY TO KEEP RATES STEEP AND RELATIVELY HIGH IN EUROS AND THAT IS KIND OF A SWEET SPOT FOR CREDIT WHERE IT IS ENOUGH YIELDS TO ATTRACT INVESTORS IN BUT NOT SO VOLATILE TO SCARE INVESTORS AWAY. ANNA: THE SOVEREIGN SIDE? IS THAT LEFT OTHERS TO DECIDE? > > LISTEN, I'M THE CREDIT GUIDE. I WOULD SAY THE MAIN POINT IS WE ARE QUITE COMFORTABLE ON HOW THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM IS POSITIONED WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT. AND SO THIS CONVERGENCE TREND WE SEE, IF WE HAVE MORE BUND, WE ARE LESS OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT IS QUITE HEALTHY FROM A CREDIT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOVEREIGN RISK IN THE WAY YOU DID 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO. ANNA: CREDIT MARKETS HAVE BEEN ENJOYING A LOT OF ISSUANCE FROM HYPERSCALERS RECENTLY. IS THAT SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING PLAY OUT EVEN MORE IN 2026? > > THAT IS THE KEY THING TO WATCH. IN CASH WHAT WE WANT TO BUY SINGLE B IS HER MAIN ASSET OF CHOICE, THE THING WE WANT TO SELL IS THE LONG END OF AN EUROS AND DOLLARS. WE ARE NOT USED TO THE LEVEL OF DURATION, LEVEL OF SUPPLY WE ARE GOING TO SEE FROM THESE HIGH QUALITY HYPERSCALERS. SO THAT IS BASICALLY THE COMPRESSION TRADE IS ON THE ONE HAND, HIGH RISK ASSETS ARE UNDERSUPPLIED AND LOW RISK ASSETS ARE VERY HEAVILY SUPPLIED . WE THINK SOMETHING LIKE 10% OF THE TOTAL HYPERSCALE DEBT ISSUANCE IS GOING TO COME TO EUROS. BUT 10% OF THE AMERICAN MARKET WHEN THE DOLLAR MARKET IS THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF THE EURO MARKET AND ABOUT 2.5 TIMES DURATION, IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. ANNA: WHETHER IN DOLLARS OR EUROS, NOT PAYING YOU ENOUGH CASH NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH? > > IT IS NOT THE ISSUER'S THEMSELVES, IT IS MORE THE DURATION BUCKET OF THE EXISTING BONDS WILL NEED TO REPRICE FROM EVERY COMPANY THAT ISSUES AT THE LONG AND IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH THE SUPPLY COMING. ANNA: THAT IS WHAT IT DOES TO THE REST OF THE MARKET. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT WHETHER STOCKS ARE OVERVALUED IN THE HYPERSCALER SPACE FOR EXAMPLE. ONE THING THEY CHOSE TO WATCH AS DEBT LEVELS. THEY SAY IT IS DIFFERENT TO THE LATE 1990'S BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT VERY INDEBTED COMPANIES. YOUR CAUTION RALLIES HYPERSCALERS IS NOT TO DO WITH IN WORRIED ABOUT DEBT SUSTAINABILITY, IT IS MORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH REWARD FOR TAKING ON THE DEBT. > > IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL POSITION WE THINK THAT PART OF THE REASON WHY THE DEBT IS COMING IS BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO IT, BUT THE POINT FROM THE INVESTOR PERSPECTIVE IS THE TECHNICAL AROUND THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THERE IS SO MUCH SUPPLIED THAT IT WILL BE PRICED IN THE MARKET. ANNA: THERE AREAS YOU DO WORRY ABOUT, TO FASTER GROWTH RATE OF DEBT FOR SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES ON THE AI BUILD OUT, THE DATA CENTER BUILDOUT? ARE THERE ANY ALARM BELLS GOING OFF RIGHT NOW? > > WE DON'T HAVE ALARM BELLS. OBVIOUSLY, NEED TO LOOK AT THE CREDITS CASE-BY-CASE. BUT ON THE WHOLE, WE THINK CREDIT IS STILL IN A FAIRLY SWEET SPOT WHERE THERE IS ENOUGH SUPPLY IN DOLLARS FOR THE BOND SCARCITY BUT NOT SO MUCH AS TO DROWN US. ANNA: WE TALKED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM ABOUT M & A STORIES, BP SELLING ONE ASSET, SANOFI BUYING ANOTHER ASSET. IF M & A COMES BACK IS A BIG THEME IN 2026 -- IT IS ARGUABLY HERE ALREADY AND INVESTMENT BANKERS HAVE BEEN TELLING US IT WAS COMING FOR A WHILE. PRIVATE EQUITY MAY BE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING AS WELL. IF WE SEE MUCH MORE M & A, IS THAT GOING TO MEAN A LOT MORE CREDIT ISSUANCE? IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL PLAY INTO YOUR SPACE? > > THAT PLACE AND OUR FORECAST BUT LARGELY A DOLLAR STORY. THE ANIMAL SPIRITS ARE MUCH STRONGER IN THE U.S. IN EUROPE, WE SAY IT IS MORE LIKE A PLANT. THE PACE OF M & A WE EXPECT IN EUROPE IS MATERIALLY SLOWER. AND THAT REFLECTS JUST A DIFFERENT ECONOMY AND DIFFERENT SECTOR MIX. ANNA: THE M & A STORY WILL BE STATESIDE YOU THINK? A LOT OF PRIVATE EQUITY NAMES AND EUROPE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME FOR M & A TICKET IN SO THEY CAN TRY AND GET SOME OF THEIR MONEY BACK. > > WE THINK IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL YOU A STORY, YES. ANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, JOSH FARBER, HEAD OF EUROPEAN CREDIT STRATEGY AT BNP PARIBAS. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS REIGNITED TENSIONS OVER GREENLAND THIS WEEK AS HE APPOINTED HIS FIRST EVER OR THE FIRST EVER U.S. ENVOY TO GREENLAND. WE WILL DISCUSS WITH ROBERTA HAAR OF MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: WELCOME BACK. THIS IS \"THE PULSE.\" LIVE FROM LONDON. PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SAYS UKRAINE AND THE UNITED STATES REMAIN SPLIT PRIMARILY ON TERRITORIAL ISSUES IN TALKS ON A PEACE PLAN TO END RUSSIA'S WAR. WEEKS OF U.S. BROKERED TALKS HAVE PRODUCED 20 POINT PEACE PLAN THAT COULD BECOME THE BASIS FOR ENDING EUROPE'S WORST CONFLICT SINCE WORLD WAR II. THE UKRAINIAN LEADER EMPHASIZED THE DRAFT LARGELY REFLECTS THE JOINT UKRAINIAN AMERICAN POSITION AND SOME POINTS STILL NEED TO BE FINALIZED. MEANWHILE, RUSSIAN CONTINUES TO TARGET UKRAINE'S POWER SUPPLY WITH MISSILES AND DRONES AT A TIME OF YEAR WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND FREEZING. THE CEO OF UKRAINE'S BIGGEST PRIVATE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT, TOLD BLOOMBERG THIS IS GOING TO BE THE HARDEST WINTER YET. > > UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE UNDER MASSIVE ATTACKS OF RUSSIANS AND THE MAJOR TARGET ATTACK IS POWER STATIONS. AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE BEING ATTACKED ON A PER STATION MORE THAN SIX TIMES SINCE SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR. I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE HARDEST WINTER SINCE A FULL-SCALE INVASION. ANNA: MEANWHILE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS IMPOSED VISA SANCTIONS ON FORMER EU COMMISSIONER AND FOUR OTHER PEOPLE FOR TRYING TO MAKE AMERICAN TECH COMPANIES POLICE POLITICAL SPEECH. IN A POST ON X, RESPONDED THE EUROPEAN WAR WAS VOTED IN WITH BROAD-BASED SUPPORT WRITING \"TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS, CENSORSHIP IS IT WHERE YOU THINK IT IS.\" THE STATE DEPARTMENT TARGETED ACTIVISTS AND NONPROFITS FOCUSED ON DIGITAL HATE SPEECH. LET'S DISCUSS THE BROAD DEFENSE AND DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS WITH ROBERTA HAAR, PROFESSOR OF FOREIGN POLICY AT MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY. PROFESSOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET'S START WITH THE BROAD STATE OF AFFAIRS TRANSATLANTIC LATE. WE RECENTLY HEARD FROM THE UNITED STATES CODIFYING THEIR SECURITY STRATEGY UNDER THIS NEW NATIONAL SECURITY DOCUMENT. I WONDER WHERE THAT LEAVES THE STATE OF RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC? > > THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. YES, AT THE MOMENT, RELATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY BUMPY. CERTAINLY, THE DOCUMENT THAT JUST CAME OUT REALLY WOULD PUSH, SHE MENTIONED BEFORE, THE FAR RIGHT OR THOSE THAT ARE ALIGNING MOST OF THE MAGA IDEAS WITHIN EUROPE, AND THIS WOULD SEEM TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT ALSO WITH JD VANCE THAT THE DIGITAL GOVERNANCE IS A PROBLEM, AS YOU SAID, RATON IS THINKING ABOUT THE EU FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS. SORRY, I'M GETTING RATHER NERVOUS. ANNA: THAT'S OK. LET ME ASK A QUESTION ON THAT MIGHT HELP US TO FOCUS THE CONVERSATION A LITTLE MORE. HOW DO YOU THINK EUROPE SHOULD RESPOND? THE UNITED STATES HAS PLACED SANCTIONS ON PEOPLE LIKE TERRY RATON, WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT SUGGESTS THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETING FREE SPEECH. HOW SHOULD EUROPE TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT SANCTIONING OF THOSE KINDS OF INDIVIDUALS? > > I THINK ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING THIS FLATTERING PLOY AND RESPONDING -- I THINK EUROPEANS SHOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO COME THEY SHOULD FIRMLY RESIST THIS PRESSURE TO SAFEGUARD, SHOULD TRY TO SAFEGUARD THE REGULATORY AUTONOMY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGIES WE HAD I WAS WITH A POLICY BRIEF AND WE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE CLEAR INTERNAL POSITIONS, SHOULD RESIST THE TIPS TO DILUTE OR REINTERPRET THEIR DIGITAL MARKETS, DIGITAL SERVICE ACT, AI ACT AND SHOULD TRY TO HOLD IT AS A REGULATORY LEADER. I THINK THEY SHOULD RESIST TRYING TO TRADE AWAY THEIR DIGITAL STANDARDS AND NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING TRADE, TARIFFS, SECURITY COOPERATION. I THINK THEY SHOULD TRY TO SHIELD THEIR EU DECISION-MAKING FROM THEIR COERCIVE BARGAINING TACTICS COMING OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. ANNA: ROBERTA, WHY DO YOU THINK EUROPE APPEARS SO CONSTRAINED WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? CLEARLY, WITH UNITED STATES PROVIDING THE SECURITY BACKDROP OVER DECADES, THAT HAS BECOME TOO COMFORTABLE POSITION PERHAPS FOR EUROPE, CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE THE VIEW OF THE AMERICANS. SO MAYBE THAT LIMITS EUROPE'S ABILITY TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. > > EUROPE DEFINITELY HAS HISTORY OF FRAGMENTATION. HISTORY OF THINKING OF SOVEREIGNTY MINDSETS. THEY ALSO HAVE MANY VULNERABILITIES. BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO INTENSIFY THEIR MILITARY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES SO THEY ARE DOING THAT. I'M SURE YOU HAVE DISCUSSED ALREADY THE LONDON-BASED II SS STUDIES HAS TALKED ABOUT THE THREAT FOR THE RUSSIA COMING AS EARLY AS 2027. IT COULD TAKE AS MUCH AS $1 TRILLION TO BRING UP THEIR NON-NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES ON A LEVEL THAT THE U.S. IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING. THEY ARE DOING THAT BUT I THINK THIS FRAGMENTATION IN PROCUREMENT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE JOINT PROCUREMENT, LESS WEAPONS SYSTEMS COMPARED TO THE PAST. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THEY NEED TO DO TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR DEFENSE PROCUREMENT AND POSTURE. ANNA: WITH ALL THAT SAID, ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A FLAREUP IN TENSIONS BE AROUND GREENLAND AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY. THE STORY SORT OF LINGERS. HOW SHOULD EUROPE RESPOND ON THIS KIND OF FRONT? PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING -- WELL, POINTING SOMEBODY TO BE ALMOST LIKE AN AMBASSADOR TO GREENLAND AND MAKING CLEAR THERE IS STILL AN INTENTION TO TRY AND MAKE THAT AMERICAN? > > CERTAINLY TRUMP HAS PAID TO PLAY FOREIGN POLICY I TALKED ABOUT WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SORT OF BASED ON MORE OF AN OVERSEAS PRESSURE. LOTS OF CORRUPTION SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. I GUESS GREENLAND WOULD FALL INTO THAT. THERE WAS A RECENT ARTICLE THAT IS PART OF A GOAL TO HAVE EUROPE AS A NEOCOLONIAL OUTLOOK ON HOW TO DEAL WITH EUROPE, THE WINNERS IN THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. SO LIKES THIS TOUGH GUY AND EUROPE WOULD BE SORT OF THE DEBTS REPLACED BY THE ALPHA MALES OF THE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT. ANNA: AND PART OF THAT ANALYSIS, DOES THAT INCLUDE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA -- WHICH HAS BEEN TRULY RESHAPED I SUPPOSE UNDER THIS TRUMP PRESIDENCY? > > I THINK TRUMP HAS A FONDNESS FOR RUSSIA OR IDEA THAT HE WANTS TO DEAL IN A TRANSACTIONAL WAY OR INVESTMENT WAY WITH RUSSIA SINCE HIS FIRST ADMINISTRATION. IN AN ARTICLE IN 2021, CERTAINLY THAT IS CONSISTENT OF HIS VIEW OR EVEN BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT THAT HE HAD THIS VERY POSITIVE VIEW TOWARD PUTIN AND TOWARD RUSSIA AND NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE INVESTMENT POSSIBILITIES WITH RUSSIA. CERTAINLY, HE LIKES TOUGH GUYS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW TRUMP DID WITH POLITICO, HE ALSO CALLED EUROPEAN LEADERS WEAK BUT HE WAS VERY POSITIVE ABOUT ERODGAN OF TURKEY. HE CALLED HIM A TOUGH COOKIE. IN ONE WAY EUROPE CAN RESPOND TO TRUMP IS NOT LETTING HIM BULLY THEM BUT TO DO WHAT MARK CARNEY DID OR ERDOGAN OR EVEN WHAT SUSIE WILES TALKS ABOUT IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, STAND UP TO HIM OR THE NOT SO FLATTERING BUT MORE RESILIENT AND MORE TOUGH. ANNA: ROBERTA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY, ROBERTA HAAR. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, A BUSY YEAR IN THE COURTS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HIS ADMINISTRATION LOSES A CASE AT THE SUPREME COURT THAT IS ANOTHER RULING UPHELD BY FEDERAL JUDGE. ALL OF THAT JUST YESTERDAY. WE BREAK DOWN ALL OF THIS WITH A LAW PROFESSOR SHORTLY. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME BACK TO \"THE PULSE.\" THESE ARE YOUR TOP STORIES. THE CENTER REALLY MARCHES ON. THE S & P HITS A RECORD AND GOLD BREAKS THROUGH $4500 FOR THE FIRST TIME. MARKETS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POND CLOSE EARLY TODAY. BLOWOUT GDP IN THE USA, AMERICAN GROWTH CRUSHES ESTIMATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER WITH ITS FASTEST READING IN TWO YEARS. AND A SETBACK FOR BIG TECH AND SKILLED FOREIGN WORKERS. A FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN MOVE AHEAD WITH A $100,000 FEE ON APPLICATIONS FOR NEW H-1B VISAS. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN IT COMES TO SETTING POLICY AND EXPANDING THE LIMITS OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER. IT CERTAINLY TESTING THEM WITH HIS TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENTS IN PARTICULAR, SENDING SHOCKWAVES AROUND THE WORLD. BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS CHIEF ECONOMIST LOOKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE TRADE POLICY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR INFLATION AND THE U.S. CONSUMER. > > CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE, PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A BIG BET THE U.S. HAD A MAGNETIC APPEAL. AND THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO GET A BETTER DEAL FROM U.S. TRADE PARTNERS AND COMPANIES THAT WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. ON THE EVIDENCE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS, THAT IS PLAYING OUT PRETTY NICELY. ECONOMISTS DON'T AGREE ON MUCH. ONE THING THEY DO AGREE ON IS THAT FREE TRADE IS GOOD AND THAT TARIFFS ARE BAD. TRUMP ESCALATED U.S. TARIFFS ON CHINA ALL THE WAY TO 125%. IF YOU PLUGGED THE U.S. TARIFFS INTO A MODEL OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WHAT IT SAID WAS THERE WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT DRAG ON GROWTH AND THERE WAS ALSO GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT UPWARD IMPULSE TO PRICES. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO INFLATION OVER THE SUMMER, IT HAS NOT COME DOWN BUT IT HAS NOT COME UP EITHER. WHY IS THAT? IT IS BECAUSE U.S. IMPORTERS AND FOREIGN EXPORTERS SAW THE TRUMP TARIFFS COMING AND THEY RUSHED TO FRONT LOAD, SHIPPING TO THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE TARIFFS COULD COME INTO FORCE. ONE THING THAT IS HAPPEN IS WE HAVE GONE FROM A LOT OF UNEXPECTED BAD NEWS CONCENTRATED ON A SINGLE DAY TO A SERIES OF COUNTRY BY COUNTRY DEALS, SOMETHING OF A SWISS CHEESE OF EXEMPTIONS AND CARVEOUTS. THE TRADE WAR IS A DRAG BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING WHICH IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE GOT TAX CUTS WITH TRUMP 'S ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL AND A BONFIRE OF REGULATIONS WHICH IS STOKING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS OF U.S. BUSINESSES. WE ALSO HAVE GOT THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT GOING INTO DATA CENTERS. TARIFFS ARE HAVING AN EFFECT. CHINA'S EXPORTS TO THE U.S. ARE WAY DOWN RELATIVE TO THE HISTORICAL TREND. SO WHO PAYS FOR THE COST OF TARIFFS? DESPITE HIS WELL-KNOWN LOVE OF GOLD, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT AN ALCHEMIST. HE CAN'T MAKE SOMETHING FROM NOTHING. THAT MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE READ ALL OF THE EVIDENCE SO FAR SUGGESTS THAT IN THE END, THE BULK OF IT IS GOING TO COME FROM U.S. BUSINESSES AND U.S. HOUSEHOLDS. ANNA: REPORTING ON WHITE HOUSE TRADE POLICY AND THE IMPACT IT HAS AND HAS NOT HAD ON THE U.S. ECONOMY. LET'S PIVOT FROM THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS TO THE LEGAL SIDE. A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED THAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN GO AHEAD WITH IMPOSING A $100,000 FEE ON NEW H-1B VISAS APPLICATIONS. IT IS A SETBACK FOR U.S. TECH COMPANIES PERHAPS THAT RELY ON HIRING SKILL FOREIGN WORKERS. THE JUDGE SAID THE MOVE WAS LAWFUL BUT THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WHICH SUED TO BLOCK THE PROPOSAL, CAN APPEAL. MEANWHILE, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS REFUSED TO LET PRESIDENT TRUMP DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN CHICAGO. A MAJORITY OF JUDGES RULED THE ADMINISTRATION FAILED TO IDENTIFY A SOURCE OF AUTHORITY THAT WOULD ALLOW THE MILITARY TO EXECUTE THE LAWS. AT THE MOVE IS A SETBACK FOR TRUMP'S BRIBED TO USE OF MILITARY IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LET'S PUT THIS TOGETHER AS THE YEAR COMES TO A CLOSE AND ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE JOINED NOW TO DISCUSS THE SUPREME COURT IN PARTICULAR BY ILARIA DI GIOIA WHO IS WITH US TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL SIDE, LAW PROFESSOR AT BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. WE HAVE GONE TO A COUPLE OF STORIES HOW IN SOME CASES PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WINNING OUT AND THE EXECUTIVE IS GETTING ITS WAY IN WHAT IT WANTS AND IN OTHER WAYS THE LAW, THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS PUSHING BACK AGAINST HIM. HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE 2025 AND THE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE SEEN BETWEEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE EXECUTIVE? > > 2025 HAS BEEN A VERY DISTINCT YEAR FOR A LAW PROFESSOR TO WATCH AND I THINK FOR EVERYONE. IF WE PUT IT IN A FRAME COME THE SUPREME COURT IS A CONSERVATIVE COURT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS APPOINTED THREE OF ITS MEMBERS. ACTUALLY, WHAT WE EXPECTED WAS THE SUPREME COURT TO BE INCREASINGLY FAVORING PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS HAS BEEN EVIDENT IN MANY CASES. YOU JUST MENTIONED THE TARIFFS. THE CASE WAS DISCUSSED IN NOVEMBER, THE HEARING WAS IN NOVEMBER AT THE SUPREME COURT. WE DON'T KNOW YET THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE BUT WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUSHING THE JUDGES TO RULE IN HIS FAVOR AND IS DOING THIS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, DOING PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE ON JUDGES THAT ARE HIS NOMINEES. THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AMERICAN SYSTEM, OF THE AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE JUDGES ARE NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT. SO IT IS SOMEHOW POLITICIZED IS A COURT THAT IS VERY EXPLICITLY POLITICIZED. AND IT IS A COURT THAT IS IDEOLOGICAL. SO CONSERVATIVE JUDGES HAVE CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGY. ANNA: THIS YEAR, HAVE WE SEEN THE SUPREME COURT ACT IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP MORE THAN WE MIGHT HAVE DONE UNDER PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT'S WHEN THEY WERE NOT -- THEY DO NOT REPRESENT QUITE SO MANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPOINTMENTS? > > WELL, IF WE PUT EVERYTHING ON THE SCALE, WE CAN SEE THE TREND ALREADY STARTED DURING THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. MANY WERE TAKEN BY THE SAME JUSTICES. THE TREND IS ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO THE FIRST TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND THE SORT OF SLOWLY INCREASING -- I WOULD NOT SAY THIS IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW OR UNEXPECTED. THIS IS JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FIRST TRUMP PRESIDENCY, OF THE NOMINATION OF THE JUSTICES. AS I SAID, WE ALREADY SEE THE TREND UNDER BIDEN AND THIS EXPANSION OF EXECUTIVE POWER THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT IS VERY, VERY EVIDENT STARTED ALREADY UNDER THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. ANNA: GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MUCH -- OK, SO UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW MUCH OF A STEP UP WE ARE SEEING IN THIS USE OF UNILATERAL EXECUTIVE ACTION. > > WELL, THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE IS A THEORY CALLED THE EXECUTIVE THEORY THAT SAYS THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE ALL THE POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND IT MEANS THE POWER THAT CONGRESS DELEGATES TO THE PRESIDENT'S POWER THE PRESIDENT CAN HOLD UNILATERALLY. NOW, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY -- NOT ONLY IN THE COURT BUT IN FACT, THE CONGRESS OF SLOWLY DELEGATING AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO TARIFFS. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ARGUING THE CONGRESS HAS GIVEN HIM THE POWER TO IMPOSE TARIFFS AND THIS IS, AS I SAID, A SLOW PROCESS THAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE FOR ONE MAIN REASON -- NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COURT, IT IS BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS GIVEN UP ITS CONFIDENCE TO THE PRESIDENT. THE POLARIZATION THAT HAVING AN CONGRESS FROM THE GRIDLOCK, THIS INCREASING DIFFICULTY IN COMING TO A DECISION MEANS THE PRESIDENT HAS THE UPPER HAND. DELEGATION OF POWER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY CONGRESS AND IS NOW UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE SUPREME COURT. ANNA: IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THEN THE SUPREME COURT WILL AGREE WITH THAT VIEW, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VIEW AND SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO ON THESE IEEPA TARIFFS? IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT WILL HAPPEN OR WE SAW QUITE A LOT OF REPORTING THAT SUGGESTED THE EARLY COMMENTARY COMING FROM THE SUPREME COURT WOULD PUSH AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. > > INDEED. DURING THE HEARING, THE JUDGES -- THE JUSTICES WERE PUSHING AND WERE PUSHING AGAINST THE FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR TRUMP. HIS NOMINEES WERE PUSHING AGAINST HIM. BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DECISIONS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE ON PAPER. IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THE DECISION TO ARISE. AND THERE HAVE BEEN OF COURSE AMICUS BRIEFS PUSHING AGAINST -- THE FACT REMAINS THE COURT IS A CONSERVATIVE COURT. IF WE DON'T SEE A DECISION IN FAVOR OF TRUMP, WE WILL SEE A DECISION MAY BE OF THOSE NEUTRAL DECISIONS THE SUPREME COURT ABSTAINING FROM DECIDING RATED THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER OPTION. SO I DON'T SEE THE SUPREME COURT TO BE COMPLETELY IN FAVOR OF TRUMP BEING ABLE TO IMPOSE TARIFFS BECAUSE IT IS A VERY NARROW LEGAL ISSUE THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON. IT IS QUITE PROBLEMATIC. BUT SEE THE SUPREME COURT USING HIS VERY INTERESTING LEGAL WEAPONS TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL. ANNA: SO I HADN'T REALIZED THEY COULD ABSTAIN. AT IS INTERESTING. WHEN WE EXPECT -- SOME EXPECTED WE MIGHT GET A DECISION THIS WEEK. LOOKING LESS LIKELY I SUPPOSE. > > THE CASE IS NOT A NORMAL CASE. IT IS ONE OF THOSE EXPEDITED DECISIONS. USUALLY CASES ARE DECIDED IN JUNE BUT I WOULD EXPECT THE CASE TO BE DECIDED A BIT EARLIER PERHAPS JANUARY OR FEBRUARY BECAUSE IT WILL NEED AN EXPEDITED DECISION. ANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, ILARIA DI GIOIA, LAW PROFESSOR AT BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY WITH THAT BRIEFING ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE EXECUTIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE ARE WATCHING OIL PRICES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THIS MORNING. NEARLY HALF A DOZEN TANKERS LADEN WITH CRUDE HAVE DEPARTED FROM VENEZUELA'S COAST DESPITE INCREASED PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES. DATA SHOWS MOST OF THE TANKERS ARE HEADED TO WASHINGTON AND AT LEAST HALF OF THEM ARE CHARTERED BY CHEVRON AS A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INTENSIFIES EFFORTS TO CURB OIL REVENUE BY TARGETING SANCTIONED VESSELS. THE VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST AND NOBEL LAUREATE TOLD BLOOMBERG IN OCTOBER THE U.S. PRESSURE ON CARACAS SHOULD FORCE PRESIDENT MADURO TO BEGIN A TRANSFER OF POWER. > > I BELIEVE THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE AND THE ESCALATION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IS THE ONLY WAY TO FORCE MADURO THAT IT IS TIME TO GO. AND THOSE THAT STILL SUPPORT HIM , WHICH ARE VERY FEW AT THIS POINT, THE TOP BRASS OF THE MILITARY, FINANCIAL ENABLERS, FRONT MEN THAT ARE MAKING HUGE ABSTAIN FORTUNES -- I'VE SEEN FORTUNES, BETTER UNDERSTAND TIME IS RUNNING OUT. I BELIEVE THIS ESCALATION IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE THAT STILL SUPPORT MADURO TO UNDERSTAND THEY NEED TO TAKE ALL SUPPORT AWAY FROM HIM AND MADURO HIMSELF TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE TO TRULY FACILITATE A PEACEFUL AND ORDER OF TRANSITION, WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT. ANNA: LIBYA'S MILITARY CHIEF OF STAFF HAS BEEN KILLED ALONGSIDE SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE IN A PLANE CRASH IN TURKEY. HE HAD BEEN RETURNING TO TRIPOLI FROM ANKARA WHEN THE PLANE REPORTED AN ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF. FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN THE MANAGING EDITOR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THIS CRASH? > > THE JET CARRYING THE LIBYAN DELEGATION CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER ITS TAKEOFF AT ABOUT 8:00 P.M. IN ANKARA THE PLANE NOTIFIED THE AIR CONTROL IT WAS SUFFERING FROM ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AND ASKED FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING BACK WHERE IT HAD TAKEN OFF FROM. PREPARATIONS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THE LANDING WHEN RADIO CONTACT WITH THE PLANE WAS LOST. ITS WRECKAGE WAS LATER FOUND IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL WITH ALL ON BOARD FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT PEOPLE INCLUDING CRUDE MEMBERS -- CREWMEMBERS, WERE KILLED. THE LIBYAN MILITARY DELEGATION WAS HEADED BY MOHAMMED ALI AHMED AL-HADDAD. HE WAS A WELL-RESPECTED FIGURE BACK IN TRIPOLI AND A KEY FIGURE IN U.N. BACK TALKS IN UNIFYING THE TWO RIVAL GOVERNMENTS IN LIBYA WHERE THE TWO ADMINISTRATIONS. ANNA: WITH THAT BACKDROP IN MIND, WHY WAS THE DELEGATION VISITING TURKEY? > > HE WAS IN ANKARA FOR DEFENSE TALKS. HIS ADMINISTRATION IN TRIPOLI HAS BEEN BACKED THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND THAT BACKING WAS MOST PRONOUNCED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO WHEN A PREDECESSOR TO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION TRIPOLI WAS UNDER ASSAULT BY FORCES IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY AND HAS SAVED ADMINISTRATION FROM COLLAPSING. SINCE THEN, ANOTHER GOVERNMENT IN THE WEST THAT HE BELONGED TO HAD BEEN OPERATING MILITARY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING PRODUCT DRONES. ONE IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN THIS REGION. THEY BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY AND WIDELY IN CONFLICTS FROM LIBYA ALDWYCH OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE WHERE THERE WAS A WAR BACK IN 2020. THE DEFENSE CORPORATION WAS THE MAIN ITEM THAT THE DELEGATION HAD COME TO ANKARA TO DISCUSS BEFORE THEY TRIED TO FLY BACK TO TRIPOLI BEFORE THE JET CRASHED. ANNA: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM COME IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL SYMBOL HAS APPROVED A STOPGAP BUDGET LAW FOR NEXT YEAR. WE WILL BRING YOU THE LATEST NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: THE CONVERSATIONS THAT MATTER AND THE INSIGHTS YOU NEED, THIS IS \"THE PULSE.\" THE FRENCH NATIONAL SYMBOL HAS APPROVED A STOPGAP BUDGET LAW FOR NEXT YEAR AFTER FAILING TO AGREE ON THE FULL FISCAL PLAN. THE SO-CALLED SPECIAL LAW EFFECTIVELY ROLLS OVER 2025 FISCAL PLANS INTO THE NEW YEAR, ALLOWING THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT TAXES AND BORROW MONEY. FOR MORE, LET'S GET TO OUR ECONOMIST AT BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS WHO JOINS US NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE FRENCH ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. WE STILL DON'T HAVE A FULL BUDGET FOR 2026, BUT ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD A FULL BUDGET? WHERE ARE THE STICKING POINTS NOW? > > THE POLITICAL SITUATION REMAINS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX. PARLIAMENT IS DEEPLY FRAGMENTED BETWEEN THE CONSERVATIVE SENATE AND THE LEFT-LEANING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. ON TOP OF THAT, POLITICAL PARTIES ARE UNWILLING TO COMPROMISE AND ARE LOOKING TO BRING HOME SOME MAJOR CONCESSIONS FROM THE GOVERNMENT LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER TAXATION ON WEALTH. UNDER BUDGET ITSELF, WE THINK A COMPROMISE IS ENRICHED AS SOME 10 BILLION EUROS OF TAX HIKES OR EXPENDITURE CUTS ARE MISSING TO ENRICH THE 5% DEFICIT CARD TO GET FOR 2026 -- TARGET FOR 2026. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE POLITICAL RISK PREMIUM IN THE MARKET IS FAILING. IF YOU LOOK AT GERMANY, IT IS BACK TO ITS AUGUST WHICH I GUESS IS QUITE A GOOD SIGN FOR THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. ANNA: YES, INDEED, THE SPREAD IN FOCUS. YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT HOW FRANCE CAN RAISE THE MONEY THAT IT NEEDS. PERHAPS SAVING BILLIONS BY BORROWING SHORT-TERM DEBT. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF GOVERNMENTS BRING FOCUS ON THE SHORT-TERM DEBT RAISING AS OPPOSED TO THE LONG END OF THE CURVE. WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THIS ANALYSIS? > > JUST TO TAKE A STEP BACK, FRANCE NEEDS TO FIND MORE THAN 100 BILLION EUROS OF SAVINGS OVER FOUR YEARS JUST TO REACH ITS COMMITMENT OF BRINGING THE BACK TO THREE PERCENT OF GDP IN 2029. TO DO THAT, MAJOR SPENDING CUTS AND PENSION REFORM AS WELL AS TAX INCREASES REMAIN CRUCIAL TO KEEP THE DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL. IN THIS CONTEXT WE CAN LOOK AT ANOTHER WAY TO SAVE MONEY AND THAT IS WHY WE LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF ISSUING SHORTER BONDS TO REDUCE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THIS WOULD BRING SOME HELP TO REDUCING INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER TIME. IT WOULD BE -- THE GAINS WOULD BE BIGGER IF THE ECB WERE TO BE A BIT MORE DOVISH. STILL, IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL. IT WOULD COME AT A HIGH COST. SOMETHING THAT LEADS US TO SAY IT WILL BE A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RISK AND SAVING MONEY. ANNA: THE ROLLOVER RISK COULD THROW UP ISSUES INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JEAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. THE ECONOMIC DATA ONCE AGAIN LEAVING INVESTORS SPLIT ON WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR MONETARY POLICY. ON ONE HAND, THE UNITED STATES, U.S. ECONOMY EXPANDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AT THE FASTEST PACE IN TWO YEARS, BOLSTERED BY RESILIENT SPENDING. ON THE OTHER HAND, A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE TOPLINE GDP DATA. THERE TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL, ARE STRATEGISTS VEN RAM. YOU HAVE DONE SOME DIGGING INTO THEIR PRINT. THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS WAS A BLOWOUT NUMBER ON GDP OUT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DEEP DIVES YET THAT REVEAL ANY SKEPTICISM. WHAT HAVE YOU UNCOVERED? > > GOOD MORNING. I THINK THE BROAD PERSPECTIVE IS YOU COULD QUIBBLE ABOUT THE ACTUAL GROWTH NUMBER BUT THE BIG PERSPECTIVE, BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE IS THE ECONOMY IS GROWING -- SEEMS TO BE FIGHTING ON ALL CYLINDERS. THAT IS A BIG TAKEAWAY. YOU'VE GOT 4.3% GROWTH EVEN ABOUT 3% FROM A 4% THEREABOUTS. I THINK U.S. ECONOMY IS DOING PRETTY WELL. THE FED EXPECTS -- THE FED HAS BOOSTED ITS OWN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH THE ECONOMY WILL GROW NEXT YEAR TO 2.3%, WELL ABOVE TREND GROWTH. HERE IS AN ECONOMY DOING PRETTY WELL. IF YOU JUXTAPOSE THAT WITH 2.8 PERCENT ON AVERAGE THIS YEAR, IT RAISES A VERY DISTURBING QUESTION. SHOULD THE FED BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES AT ALL IN THIS KIND OF SCENARIO? WHICH PART OF THE ECONOMY NEEDS RATE CUTS? IF WHERE INFLATION ISN'T AT TARGET YET, WHY ARE THEY RUSHING TO CUT RATES? THAT IS A BIG QUESTION FOR THE MARKETS TO WRESTLE WITH NEXT YEAR. ANNA: OK, AND ANOTHER QUESTION, WHETHER WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON METALS, PRECIOUS METALS IN PARTICULAR? CAN THE RALLY CONTINUE IN PRECIOUS METALS? > > IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE. IT CERTAINLY GOT MOMENTUM. THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL SEEM TO BE BUYING GOLD. SILVER IS LEADING WITH GOLD HIGHER IN PARTICULAR LIKE OF THE CYCLE. THE SUPPLY SQUEEZE CONTINUES, I THINK SILVER WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD GOLD HIGHER. MARKETS HAVE CAUGHT UNDER THIS PROPHECY THAT IT IS GOING TO GO TO $5,000 AN OUNCE. SO EVERYONE IN GOLD, EVERYONE'S CROSS HAIRS. TO AN EXTENT, THIS IS A BIT OF A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY FOR THE MARKETS. EVERYONE IN THE MARKETS EXPECTS THAT LEVEL TO BE CROSSED AND THEREFORE IT DOES LOOK LIKE WE MAY GET TO THAT LEVEL. BUT THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES A RISK-REWARD BEYOND THAT? GOLD CAN'T KEEP RISING. IT HAS RISEN 70% THIS YEAR. THAT IS THE SECOND BEST ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SINCE 1979. THE IRONY IS IF YOU BOUGHT AT THE PEAK IN 1979, IT TOOK YOU YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE YOU BROKE EVEN. I THINK INVESTORS NEED TO PAY SOME CAUTION TO HOW MUCH THEY ARE PAYING TO GET -- GOLD. ANNA: KEEP THAT FACT IN MIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO GET IN TO THIS TRADE. LOOKING AT CENTRAL BANKS IN 2026, ARE WE LOOKING AT A FULL RANGE OF HAWKS, DOVES, NEUTRAL, EVERYTHING IN THE MIX IN TERMS OF CENTRAL BANKING? > > WELL, I THINK AT LEAST A FEW THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE GOING TO BE HAWKISH. THE BANK OF AUSTRALIA AND BANK OF NEW ZEALAND ARE ALREADY SHOWING INCLINATION THEY'RE GOING TO BE A BIT HAWKISH. GET THE ECB THAT IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE NEUTRAL BECAUSE INFLATION IS A TARGET. IT IS PROBABLY THE CLEAREST READ ON WHICH CENTRAL BANK IS GOING TO STAY PUT. ALSO AVERSE TO NEGATIVE RATES SO I THINK THEY MAY STAY PUT. IN CANADA AND THE U.S. I THINK INTEREST RATES NEED TO GO HIGHER. IN CANADA, THE MARKETS ARE PRICING SOME CHANCE OF A RATE HIKE BUT IN THE U.S., AS YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE THINKING AND THE MARKETS ARE THINKING INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN BECAUSE OF WHAT TRUMP WANTS . WE WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES. IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING 2026 FOR THE RATES MARKETS FOR SURE. ANNA: COMPLEX FOR ALL OF THE USUAL REASONS AND A SPRINKLING OF POLITICS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE LATEST ON SOME OF THE CENTRAL BANK THINKING AS WE HEAD INTO 2026. A QUICK WORD ON THE MARKETS, QUITE FLAT ON EUROPEAN EQUITIES. NOT MANY OF THE EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE OPEN. WE ARE OPEN IN LONDON, PARIS, AMSTERDAM. GERMANY IS CLOSED, SWITZERLAND IS CLOSE, MANY OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN MARKETS AND NORTHERN EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE CLOSED MOST OF U.S. FUTURES POINTING TO TOUCH LOWER. IT IS CHRISTMAS EVE. HAVE A GOOD HOLIDAY, EVERYBODY.

GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT NEW HIGHS -- AND MERRY CHRISTMAS DO YOU -- WHAT NEW HIGHS WE CAN HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY MARKETS NEXT YEAR? CAMERON: GOOD MORNING AND MERRY CHRISTMAS. IT IS TIME TO DUST OFF THE OLD ADAGE WHICH IS RESPECT THE TREND BUT DON'T IGNORE THE RISKS AS ARE GOING TO 2026. RESPECTING THE TREND APPRECIATES THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL IN AN UPTREND IN THE MARKET, AND IT IS BEING LED BY PROCYCLICAL AREAS. YOU MENTIONED INDUSTRIAL COMMODITIES. YOU ALSO HAVE LEADERSHIP WITH THINGS LIKE BANKS, TRANSPORT STARTING TO TURN HIGHER, SO THERE IS A PROCYCLICAL MESSAGE COMING OUT OF THE MARKET, AND YOU ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT UPTREND IN EARNING ESTIMATES AND GDP ESTIMATES, AND THIS HAS BEEN THE KEY FUNDAMENTAL UNDERPINNING OF WHY WE KEEP GETTING TO WRESTLE WITH NEW HIGHS. AS LONG AS YOU REVISE ESTIMATES HIGHER, THERE'S USUALLY A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR TAKING. THE SECOND HALF OF THAT IS DO NOT IGNORE THE RISKS. THAT IS WHERE WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE VALUATIONS AND SIGNS OF COMPLACENCY IS WITHIN MARKETS, LOOK AT THE VIX TURNING EVER LOWER EACH AND EVERY DAY, SO IT COULD BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE STILL ABLE TO CARVE OUT NEW HIGHS BECAUSE OF THE EARNINGS ESTIMATES, BUT THERE COULD BE SOME VOLATILITY ALONG THE WAY, SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A HIGH MARK WITH VALUATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS, AS WELL. ANNMARIE: BUT YOU THINK POSITIONING IS NOT STRETCHED. WHAT WOULD GET US TO THAT POINT? CAMERON: OUR FAVORITE MEASURE IS LOOKING AT THE DEUTSCHE BANK CONSOLIDATED EQUITY POSITIONING, MEASURING INSTITUTIONAL POSITION. WHAT IS FASCINATING IS WE ARE IN THE 62ND PERCENTILE, SLIGHTLY OVERWEIGHT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT DISCRETIONARY INVESTORS, THEY ARE STILL JUST NEUTRAL. WE THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR MORE PEOPLE TO GET DRAGGED INTO THE MARKET, BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONING, WE HAVE TO MENTION HOUSEHOLDS AND THAT IS WHERE YOU CANNOT MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE UNDERWEIGHT EQUITIES. YOU COULD LOOK AT THE SURVEY THAT LOOKS AT THE POSITIONING. THAT IS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT HAS BEEN SINCE 2018 AND 2022. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MARGIN LOANS HAVE GROWN EXTRAORDINARILY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS AT ABOUT A 40% CLIP, SO THERE ARE SIGNS THAT HOUSEHOLDS ARE FULLY INVESTED, BUT SOME INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS HAVE STILL SAT ON THE SIDELINES, WHICH IS LIKELY WHY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR SO, EVERY DIP HAS GOTTEN BOUGHT SO QUICKLY. SCARLET: TALK ABOUT THE MONEY ON THE SIDELINES, THE DRY POWDER IF THEY WILL. WE TALKED ABOUT MANY MARKET FUNDS AND HOW THERE ARE 70 TRILLION FORMS OF DOLLARS WAITING TO BE DEPLOYED. MAYBE RETAIL INVESTORS ARE FULLY INVESTED, BUT THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD PUT MORE INTO THE MARKET. HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THAT MONEY TO BE PUT TO WORK? CAMERON: WE NEVER CONSIDERED THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS AS FUNGIBLE THAT COULD GO INTO EQUITIES, MEANING THAT THESE WERE SAVINGS AND CASH BALANCES THAT WERE TYPICALLY HELD IN CASH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS VERSUS THINGS THAT WERE JUST ANXIOUS AND WAITING TO GO INTO EQUITIES. SO MAYBE AT THE MARGIN, AS YOU SEE THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS START TO FALL, IT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT LINE STRAIGHT INTO THE EQUITY MARKET. CERTAINLY MONEY MARKET RATES FALLING COULD PUSH INVESTORS INTO LOOKING INTO OTHER AREAS INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING ON THE SIDELINES AND CLIPPING COUPONS -- CLIPPING COUPONS BUT NOT NECESSARILY $7 TRILLION THAT WILL GO INTO EQUITIES. SCARLET: THE CENTER RALLY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, HOW MUCH IS DRIVEN BY TECHNICAL FACTORS LIKE POSITIONING VERSUS TRUE FUNDAMENTALS, EARNINGS GROWTH, AND THE EARNINGS OUTLOOK FOR 2026? CAMERON: THIS TIME OF YEAR WE TRY NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO THE PRICE ACTION GIVEN VOLUME IS SO LIGHT. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE TENDS TO BE SOME KIND OF WINDOWDRESSING AND POSITIONING CHASES TO YEAR END, BUT WHAT IS FASCINATING IS WE SAW THE ROTATION AND LEADERSHIP START A LITTLE EARLY THIS YEAR. TYPICALLY WE SEE LEADERSHIP ROTATIONS WE HAVE YOUR CLASSIC DOWEL, OR THE FIRST TRADE THAT KICKS OFF IN JANUARY AS PEOPLE START TO REBALANCE PORTFOLIOS, BUT IT SEEMED TO START IN NOVEMBER THIS YEAR, WHERE WE SOLVE VALUE, FOR EXAMPLE, OUTPERFORM GROWTH BY 5% SINCE NOVEMBER 1, SO MAYBE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF THAT, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE TRY NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO IT AND LIVE YOUR KIND OF PRICE ACTION, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REFLECT ANYTHING MORE THAN LIKELY POSITIONING CHASING. ANNMARIE: WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMODITY SPACE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM, GOLD, SILVER, PLATINUM, COPPER, DO YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THINK YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN PART OF THIS INTO 2026 OR DO YOU THINK INDIVIDUAL SHOULD MAKE SURE COMMODITIES ARE PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIO? CAMERON: WE SEE COMMODITIES AS A WAY TO HAVE AN INFLATION HEDGE WITHIN PORTFOLIOS, AND THEY WORK REALLY WELL WHEN THEY WORK WELL AND THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL THE GOOD PORTION OF THE TIME, SO WE HAVE BEEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THAT HAS BEEN A VERY POWERFUL UPTREND FOR A LOT OF THESE COMMODITIES. I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH CAN I CONTINUE? DR. GRAFF OF RENAISSANCE MACRO PUT OUT A GREAT PIECE EFFECTIVELY SAYING, WHEN YOU DOUBLED YOUR RETURN IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, THE PROBABILITY OF YOU DOING IT AGAIN IS EXTRAORDINARILY LOW, SO IT GETS BACK TO THIS OVERALL NOTION OF WE ARE NOT IGNORING RISKS. GOLD HAS HAD A POWERFUL UPTREND, THE CHUCK MORSE OF COMMODITIES. NOTHING SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT DOWN, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT LONGER TERM CHARTS, IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY OVERBOUGHT, SO IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING TO SEE SOME KIND OF CONSOLIDATION, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE STILL REMAINS POWERFUL DRIVERS. FOR EXAMPLE, CENTRAL BANK BUYING OF GOLD, BUT ALSO IT HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT 5, MEANING THAT IT HAS BECOME EFFECTIVELY AND MOMENTUM STOCK WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF TRADING IN RETAIL INVESTORS, AS WELL AS INVESTORS OVERSEAS, SO IT COULD GET A LITTLE OVER", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:14:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T15:27:45.616044"}

The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a reading of 53.5.\n“Despite some signs of improvement to close out the year, sentiment remains nearly 30% below December 2024, as pocketbook issues continue to dominate consumer views of the economy,” Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement.\nThe current conditions gauge slid to a record-low of 50.4, while a gauge of expectations climbed to a four-month high. Consumers’ perception of current buying conditions for big-ticket items deteriorated to the lowest on record. Will Auchincloss, Americas Retail Sector Leader at EY-Parthenon, breaks down the state of the consumer. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nConsumers are showing in our monthly surveys that they're getting less and less confident in the economy as the year wears on. And there's several factors that are driving that. One is the job outlook. The biggest reason now, however, is inflation and the continued pressure on essential categories like food, housing, even debt now is sort of emerging as a topic for consumers. And so they are trying to muscle through this environment as best as they can. And that is weighing on the retail sector. And it's it's weighing a little bit on the holiday season as well. But we're seeing some pretty good numbers out of some of the retailers. I mean, I'm seeing, you know, probably three or 4% retail sales growth here in the holiday season with the e-commerce even higher than that. It seems like consumers are still spending, though. They are, Paul, and they are trying to spend on the holiday and kind of keep that basket together as best they can. But there's some underlying factors that make the headline data a little bit more, more nuanced. So the majority of what we're seeing is that that those year over year gains are driven primarily by price actions and not volume. And in fact, in our headline outlook for the for the holiday season, we sort of forecasted about a 2 to 3% year over year growth rate. I think it's coming in a little bit higher, which is good news. But the majority of that is driven by price. Almost two thirds of that is driven by price and not volume. So, you know, as a retail sector, you like to see more volume going out the door historically. And so again, it's a little bit softer. I think part of that is certain chains have really resonated with consumers this this holiday season. They've gotten the value equation better aligned to expectations. And there is some channel switching happening that appears in our survey as well. We're seeing that increase as as consumers want to sort of shop what they've always shop for, but get a better price for it in whatever channel is best suited for them. Yeah, we were talking about somebody earlier talking about shopping earlier in the show and how consumers have become much more intentional about what it is they're spending their money on. But let's talk about restaurants and bars and how we're spending on that. I mean, how did you talk about that in the survey and what did you guys find out? We do. And that that sector in particular is getting much better, is facing much more significant headwinds because it's the first category consumers repeatedly tell us they're going to pull back on. And then and indeed, we're we're seeing that in some of the top line numbers, albeit there are a couple really exciting sort of turnaround stories in the sector that I think shows that point about aligning with consumers. But in general, consumers, the number one category they want to pull back on is eating out, particularly at higher end establishments. And so when they're paying more for groceries and the basics, it kind of makes sense that they would switch to to more in-home eating. And so that really is putting a pressure on restaurants and the QSR space. We've seen a lot of revamped emphasis on value and value menus to try and stem that tide. But it has been a tough year for for the restaurant sector in general, and we don't expect that to change much going into 2026. Will What's typically an anecdote to consumer spending concerns? I'm not sure it's the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points, and it seems like the economy is essentially fully employed. What needs to change here? Yeah, I think it's a couple of things. One is that they have to have more confidence. And, you know, with all the change in the policies coming out of out of the federal government with concerns about inflation really showing up in their, you know, the receipts and some concerns about the economic outlook and a little bit of a I it's it's a it's sort of a psychological aspect of this that's really weighed on the sector. However, there are some real economic drivers because a lot of the GDP growth we're seeing is driven by what we call the three A's. So that's affluent consumers. That's asset price realization in the stock market and. It's so I'm forgetting the third day it's AI driven investment which is dealing the the the sort of the stock price appreciation. So that's propping up a lot of this. And affluent consumers in particular are really need to kind of continue that that that spending pattern as we go into 2026 if we're going to continue at the levels we're content seen today and with in terms of how we're paying for these things and, you know, consumers taking on debt, especially during the holiday season, I know that they're using a lot more buy now, pay later platforms, and that could be troubling down the road. Yeah, that that is a concern for us to monitor. And and savings in general has declined since Liberation Day. Again, as consumers try and buy what they've always purchased, but in the face of higher prices. So we've gone from a savings economy to a debtor economy, and that shows up in the macro data. That is a potential risk in the outlook for for 2026, because the question is how long can they keep doing that? And those debt levels have sort of increased generally across all income segments as well. So it's not just centered in one income segment. That's not we're not reaching sort of crisis levels by any stretch, but it is another potential headwind as we cross into next year.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:50:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T16:32:44.108471"}
{"title": "TheRealReal Sees Resilient Consumers", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-12-24/therealreal-sees-resilient-consumers-video", "summary": "Rati Levesque, The RealReal President & CEO, Bloomberg Open Interest with Vonnie Quinn and Emily Graffeo to speak to the strength of the US consumer. Levesque says the secondary luxury market is strong as more customers look for value. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWe're seeing the buyer be quite resilient at the REALREAL. We're seeing consumer trends being quite strong around fine jewelry, watches, handbags. We're definitely probably a tariff beneficiary, but at the same time, there's other things kind of impacting our business. Resale is becoming more mainstream. That's number one. And definitely seeing that led by the Gen Z and millennial consumer. We're seeing fine jewelry and watches be very popular, like I mentioned, gold pricing, silver pricing going up. And then we're also seeing gifting becoming less of a stigma of resale. So almost 60% of consumers now say they prefer the secondary market outright. So seeing lingerie and seeing resale specifically becoming much more mainstream right now. Now you've been aggressively cost cutting, restructuring your commissioned model and so on. Is there any danger that you will maybe not get in the supply that you need in order to keep supplying this market? Yeah. So, you know, it's interesting. I think that one one of the things is that there's $200 billion trapped in people's closets. That's just in the U.S. alone. And so we're it's such an untapped industry. At the end of the day, $80 billion gets added to that every year. So, so much got so much luxury goods just in the U.S. alone. And so many of these people have never consigned anything before. So we're seeing people become kind of introduced to luxury for the first time. So double digit new seller growth, for example. So people are really starting to change the way they shop and they're checking the prices in the secondary market before they're even purchasing in the primary market. I wanted to talk about prices, Brodie, because our very own Amanda Bloomberg wrote just a few days ago, 2019, the price of a Chanel flat bag, $5,800. Fast forward to right now, it's over $11,000. I'm wondering just how much the growth of the real real is coming out of the fact that people feel like they just can't they can't stomach the prices in the luxury market. Yes, there's a couple of things happening. Any time the price increases in the primary market. Our pricing goes up, too. So for whatever reasons, whether it's tariffs, whether the pricing of a Chanel that goes up, for whatever reason, our prices go up as well. But like I said, what we're also seeing is more volume coming through. So more people being introduced to luxury and testing it out and then they get that first paycheck, right? They get that first paycheck for the bag and then they go back into the primary market. What we're actually seeing is that circular economy. And so they'll go back into the primary market with their check and buy the newest trend or buy something that they've been eyeing, and then they'll consign two or three things instead. So we'll see that kind of trade up happening as well. And what are the consumers typically gravitating for on the real, real? Are they looking for a bargain on a classic luxury item or are they turning to secondhand markets when they want to buy something trendier? Yeah, So we're seeing that intersection between value and luxury. That's what we offer right at the end of the day. And then you've got very unique items and most of our items you can't buy anywhere else. So they're looking for those one of a kind pieces. You know, they're kind of maybe done with the trends or everything starting to look the same. It's a badge of honor to wear something very unique from the real world. So think of them like drops. Thousands of items get dropped everyday that are very unique to the consumer consumers. That's number one. Buying jewelry, like I mentioned, watches, handbags, vintage is a big one, as is condition. Again, seeing more of that value play come through. People are looking for that value. They'll take something that maybe is in better condition instead of pristine condition, just that it costs a little less at the end of the day. You know, there are competitors out there now, fashion file, rebuy and so on. How do you compete with them? Yeah. So, you know, when I think about the real, real, it's really around we offer very in-depth in product. So we don't offer just one category, right? It's handbags, it's jewelry, watches, fashion, textiles, silverware, all of that we're offering at the real, real. So there's a lot of and then we give you cash up front. And that's really important, right? Versus trade up or trading and then you earn the most with us. And that's really important to say. And the reason why is because of the trust that we built with the consumer. Because we know because you can sign with us, because we've got almost 50 million members now that we built trust with because of our pricing algorithm. Yes, you can earn the most with us at the end of the day. I'm curious as well, how much are your physical stores contributing? Are they contributing to the bottom line? And, you know, is it just a marketing play at the end of the day? And when does that bottom line, by the way, turn positive? Yeah. So the stores pay back very quickly, actually. And what we see is a halo impact. So it's meeting the consignor where they are, whether they want to drop off in the store on their way to work, whether they want a van pick up at 3 p.m. this afternoon on demand, they'll can book that from their app. And we're seeing the consignor the seller can more items when they interact with the store and more high value items because they're meeting with a gemologist and watchmaker. So yes, it's a place that people get introduced to our being, our brand, where a quarter of our new consignors come from, the stores, from our retail locations. But we more see a halo impact. So from the Consignor consigning more for us with us and then spending more at the end of the day to.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:38:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T16:57:25.170853"}

Wilson also said that for tricky post-holiday tasks like returning or exchanging gifts, consumers are turning to chatbots for help. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nI think they were. But I think overall you're kind of view of a mere holiday might have been the word of the day. So so holiday was stronger than expected. We saw consumer spend the results coming out higher than analysts had predicted. But I would say it was kind of a you know, at least in my house, what we call that was the year of the sweater. So it was a very practical holiday spending, Hey, you know, withheld all of the headwinds, but it didn't give anybody a ton of surprises. You know, I think things were very practical that the smart consumer kind of played out. What was ours was socks. The socks. Yeah. How bad is that? Or you know what? SNL had a great skit. They always do it. It was a it's an old skit, but they did it where the mom gets a robe every year, but everybody else in the family gets like really cool gifts. And she's like, I have another robe, so I feel you on the sweater robe socks thing. But what about gift cards? I remember when they were sort of all the rage, people were going out and buying gift cards because they didn't know what else to do. Do you think that was a thing? Because it crept up on them? Yeah, absolutely. So I think gift cards and we'll really see where the consumer plays out in terms of the categories because of the gift card trend. I think a lot of people, the sentiment, you know, and and actually we have fewer days between Black Friday and Christmas Day this year. So a lot of people, it caught them by surprise. And so gift card as the gift of choice is definitely something that we predicted with our consumer poll survey and then actually played out. So I think you'll see a lot of spend over this weekend to see if, you know, if electronics kind of nudge ahead or if people are still using the gift card to get the things that they kind of were or holding out on just as they were, you know, a bit spendthrift over the period like this, You know, that area is a big time concern because right behind her is a whiteboard. And whenever a whiteboard is brought out in the meeting I'm in, I get up and I leave. Thank you very much. I may translate. It's actually a painting, but yeah, I get the whiteboards. On the other side of the room there is a whiteboard and lots of business books as well. How they do it, that's how the consultants think. They're big time out of the box. We haven't had a retailers reach their consumers these days. I mean, I mean, you know, how do you reach a John Tucker who's not at the beck and call of influencers on social media? So, you know, the new retail strategy is definitely being where the consumer is. So omnichannel demand is kind of the thing. And finding them, whether you're you do like to see it in your feeds or the traditional social media outlets of Facebook, Instagram, etc., are not gone. Chat, Jeep, Gemini, everything, making sure that you're searchable there and that it's easy to to click through is kind of the second area to take. This is the first year that we really saw a I take off from a consumer perspective and then the traditional ad, it's not gone. You know, there's some of us that are still in, you know, we watch TV, we watch it, you know, we do things on YouTube, etc.. And so finding that that perfect mix is is complex. But we have a lot more tools today to get in front of the consumer. All right. Who here is doing dry January dry January being that you don't drink for the month of June, please. It's like wine I've heard you know sprinkle January is another thing our consumer survey said about one in three Americans are participating in dry January. It's for health reasons is the number one reason. But the second reason is to spend less money. So I think we if that if we aren't knocked over the head with the thing of the frugal consumer, we're continuing to see that even as we head into dry January. But it is a restrained consumer thinking about health and wellness for sure. You know, I it has kind of seeped into all aspects of our lives, all aspects of the economy. How are retailers, how our consumers using air in their purchasing? I have to tell you, as a last minute shopper, I does not bring the package to your door. So that's one thing that we could maybe look for in the future. If you're buying in the last 10 hours of the holiday shopping spree, then you do need to go in a store and physically pick it up. But I think is helpful. And, you know, we just mentioned that the returns that are about to happen. So figuring out where to to go, how to print a label, some of those really tactical things that you would have to sift through and try to figure out is helping the consumer on that side. But from the retailers perspective, you know, we can't forget just how important it is for them to use it to drive productivity and enhance personalization. So KPMG, we talk about the front, middle and back. Office II is really helping us do some of those things of, you know, the the chats to when when a consumer has a question about how to put together a toy or where to return.

There's certainly been a build up of narrative coming from the administration that there was atrocities involving Christians in Nigeria, and it wasn't the work of ISIS. Now, the US government, at the behest of the Nigerian government, takes action. Yes, this really came as a surprise, particularly this that, you know, in the eve of Christmas Day there being this strike on this Islamic State site in Nigeria. And as you noted, this was done in conjunction with the Nigerian intelligence services and and military. But the Nigerian government is really pushing back hard on the narrative that there is religious persecution happening in the country. They said, yes, there are terrorist attacks happening. This is a problem, but that Christians and Muslims are both both targeted in these. You know, this is really a narrative we've seen from Washington. You know, Trump has mentioned several times he's worried about the persecution of Christians. We even have Ted Cruz in the Senate who's tried to get Nigeria labeled as a as a country that is persecuted Christians. But this, you know, kind of the narrative, at least here, you know, that really appeals to the MAGA base doesn't actually match what we're seeing in terms of the actual conditions on the ground. More broadly, are we expecting anything to escalate from here? We we know that there has been this move made. Is it sort of meant to be a preemptive strike to iron out any further risks of escalation or acts of atrocity or terrorism that's occurring in the country? We don't know exactly what more is to come, though. We do know that there will be something. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said yesterday that there would be more of these attacks to come. Exactly The timing, the tenor, the location are all still very unclear. But this is what we are seeing is a real ramp up of U.S. military strikes across the globe that were strikes in Syria last week, of course, the build up in Venezuela.

Almost. Pegging a crypto token’s value to a real-world currency (almost always the dollar) makes it look like money. But even with one-for-one reserve backing — as mandated by the Trump administration’s Genius Act, passed in July — its relationship to money remains one step removed. Not everyone wants to be confronted by foundational concepts like singleness and supply elasticity while buying groceries.\n\nPayment rails? Almost. There is a logic to putting dollars on the blockchain, particularly in the US, where merchant fees are artificially high. Small payment systems work just fine nearly everywhere else, however, so stablecoins for daily use looks like a solution seeking a problem.\n\nRemittance systems? Almost. Some may value moving money across borders, 24/7, without the friction of security checks. But while a clearing house may cost more, it provides someone to blame if something goes wrong.\n\nExchange traded funds? Almost. But ETF issuers rely on independent auditors and custodians. Stablecoin issuers such as Tether, the world’s biggest, prefer a more DIY approach.\n\nThe point here is that many money-like products already exist. They are tightly regulated and issued under conventions hardened by crises. Stablecoins were born of a desire to bring new customers to the crypto casino. Secondary uses like funding illicit trade stem directly from regulatory ambiguity.\n\nStablecoins may benefit the US, which has a lot of dollar-denominated debt to sell. The challenge for others countries is to justify why private money should exist alongside their own currencies, while resisting the temptation to regulate stablecoins like something they are not.\n\nbryce.elder@ft.com", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 05:00:16 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T05:27:08.120964"}

And you never know—a few of them could even have a breakout moment you’ll find yourself humble-bragging about.\n\nOn this episode of Trillions, Eric Balchunas and Joel Weber are joined by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Athanasios Psarofagis and James Seyffart, who helped write the team’s annual report. The episode features 16 ETFs, including the tickers BINC, XOVR, MSOS, BUFB, UFOD, OTGL, VXUS, SBIL, RSST, SPYM, BOXX, GRFT, ITB, PXUI, PCLN and LRND.\n\n\n\nMoney goes where it’s treated best. That simple truth is a big reason why more and more money (trillions of dollars, in fact) flows into a powerful, low-cost tool that’s quietly transformed investing.

Photo: Yevgen Romanenko By Sam Potter January 1, 2026\n\nAstronomical expenditure. Uncertain rates of return. Uneven pace of adoption.\n\nBy now every firm on Wall Street is well aware of the risks surrounding the artificial intelligence boom. But when it comes to the year ahead, few advocate walking away from what they describe as a “revolutionary” technology. Across the investment outlooks from more than 60 institutions compiled here by Bloomberg News, the optimism is almost universal.\n\nFidelity International calls AI “the defining theme for equity markets” in 2026. The BlackRock Investment Institute says the tech will likely “keep trumping tariffs and traditional macro drivers.” NatWest spies “a powerful engine of economic expansion.” Even the most bearish firm — BCA Research, which warns of a potential US recession — stays neutral on stocks for now on the tailwind of AI’s huge capital expenditure.\n\n“The biggest risk, to us, is not having exposure to this transformational technology,” JPMorgan Wealth Management says.\n\nSee the all the calls for 2026 ↓\n\nWhen it comes to risks to the outlook, the worries are conventional. Geopolitics. Trade barriers. A weakening US labor market (BCA’s chief concern). But with the AI boom holding up, the Federal Reserve seen loosening monetary policy, and further support arriving in the shape of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and Germany’s fiscal stimulus, the general consensus is for the global expansion to rumble on.\n\n“Regional policy shifts suggest a more supportive macro backdrop for global growth in 2026,” writes State Street. “With an inflation trajectory trending lower, US policy rates likely to fall as the Fed takes stock of a softening labor market, and policy levers turning stimulative, we have a supportive environment for risk assets.”\n\nStill, optimism over returns has a limit. Valuations of key assets remain elevated, with many equities looking pricey and credit spreads extremely tight. US tariffs remain in place, acting as a brake on global growth. Inflation is still not vanquished.\n\n“There is a disconnect between the positive short-term environment for risk assets, and a broader structural instability,” says Fidelity. “Global fragmentation, a depreciating dollar, US Federal Reserve independence, and AI capex trends are themes to watch in 2026 and beyond.”\n\nBloomberg’s annual compilation of outlooks for the year ahead features more than 700 calls, presented here for easy analysis and comparison. They talk of an environment where the AI spend and government policies are adding fuel to growth at an unusual stage of the business cycle. They argue inflation won’t quite be tamed as a result, and that central banks may not have the room to maneuver that markets currently expect. Private assets will continue their ascent. The dollar will continue its decline.\n\nThe calls have been divided into sections covering the key themes and assets. Each section has a short summary, and the calls will load in approximate order based on the level of conviction displayed (highest-conviction calls appearing first). The filtering tool will allow you to view the calls from multiple specific institutions at once.\n\nThis is what the finance world’s best and brightest see in the year ahead.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 22:00:09 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T22:26:37.952863"}

Bill Shufelt, the Co-Founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing joined Bloomberg TV and radio to talk about the outlook for NA beer in the new year and how his brand is trying to redefine how we drink. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nBill Shufelt is the co-founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing Company. I'm sure you've seen those cans in the stores or perhaps at your local bar. It's one of the nation's top non-alcoholic beer brands. He joins us now in studio to talk about what's on tap for booze, less suds. So, Bill, this is an insane growth story that you've just been telling me. So you started actually, what, ten years ago and now you're ten X or the market is ten X. Explain what you were just telling us for sure. It's it's been a really fun ride. We started the non-alcoholic beer market basically and flatlined for 30 years before ten years ago where we came in and like to think we reimagined both the product and the marketing of the category, taking it out of the penalty box into the mainstream with delicious flavors. And we've taken it as a category from about 100 million to passing ,000,000,000 in the US market this year. And we think that could continue to grow. We expected to five X in the next ten years with athletic being 25% of that market. Right now athletic is about 18.4 share the total category. The next biggest is about 14 and a half share, and that's another four point drop to the next brand behind that. Athletics also 52 share of the non-alcoholic craft beer category, which has well over 100 brands. So we're outselling the next 100 plus combined. And it's really meeting those that next generation of consumers where they're at. What's been the response, competitor response from some of the big brewers, which I can't even know the names now, they've all merged into like one big entity, I think for sure. So as you've heard on the segment before, two of over 40% of consumers are doing dry. January this year, Over 50% of consumers now view one or two drinks a day as unhealthy, and a record low number of Americans are also consuming alcohol on a weekly basis. So this is a huge growth opportunity for the adult beverage market. And a lot of companies were late to that. But over the last five years, basically every major brand has entered that category with that alcoholic analog to there are non-alcoholic analog to their full strength version. And we really appreciate that support and growing the category because it's so funny to me because I didn't have an alcoholic beverage in my life until I was nearly 30, I think. And I wonder what makes somebody reach for a non-alcoholic beer when there are so many other drinks that are already non-alcoholic out there? For sure. It's so when we started athletic and I would try to get people to taste samples or buy one of our beers, getting people to cross that barrier was so hard seven or eight years ago. But I think the lightbulb that goes on over and over again for people is that it is such a delicious meal pairing at a fraction of the calories as a full strength alcohol equivalent. For example, we were just talking about before I came in, how our athletic light is 25 calories, no sugar, light and carbs, but a full taste that's like a perfect guilt free weeknight beer. And then we brought a ton of innovation to the market, too. For example, we're now launching an excited lineup of non-alcoholic brewed cocktails this January at select retailers like Target and all these different fun flavored and like, well, give us a foretaste. Yeah. So we have after the athletic light lager, we have an athletic lite Lyman Salt launching this year and in a typical year we launch almost 50 different styles of beers on our website. Athletic Brewing become where before Athletic Brewing this category was a lager only category. So from day one, we've really blown the lid off what taste and availability can be in this category. Who's a typical athletic drinker customer? So when we came into the category, this category was typically a lapsed alcohol drinker. It was very male heavy as the older population generally. And since we've redefined the product and marketing of the category, we've seen that drift younger and younger. Every year. We think 45% of our consumers are below age 45, very heavy in Gen Z. Consumers really, as people have grown up in this digital generation where you have your work in your pocket at all times, everything in your life is filmed and recorded and on record and people still like to drink, but then they like the zebra stripe and working non-alcoholic options to super stripping. And I heard that and I forgot it already. Yeah, sorry I jumped right over that. It's basically we and this has been shocking to me. I hear from bartenders all the time that people order alcoholic drinks non-alcoholic alcohol. Oh, okay, I got it. Okay. That's a brilliant idea. You can put food in there to know for sure. Better idea. Curious. How do you do it? You have so many options and as you say, you're trying out different ones all the time. I mean, are you very non-profitable or how does it work? That costs a lot of money? Well, at the end of the day, in our retail lineup, we're very focused. We have a core group of about five beers, which are very popular and highly awarded. We won 33 Taste awards last year alone and have won about 185 Taste awards since. You know, there's there's been a plethora of entrants into this category from major brewers to there's been ten celebrity brands with more on the way and. Almost none of these companies make their own beer. Where athletic has gone the other way, we invested 130 million and our own manufacturing, our brewing quality teams. And ultimately consumers like to know they they want to get the best products and like to know what's behind their products. And after that celebrity hype, they've really loved what they found in athletic. And so we really try to stay focused on our retail lineup and bring people the best beers over and over again. I got to put my investment banker hat back on. How do you capitalize your company? I'm always fascinated to see how these private companies, entrepreneurial companies, how they finance themselves. Yeah, it's such an interesting I like I came from the financial world. It's such an interesting world these days between private and public capital. And we've been so fortunate to have great access to private capital, from angel investors to private equity investors like airlines, consumer growth and General Atlantic. And an institutional investor encouraged Dr. Pepper. And that's afforded us the opportunity over the past eight years to invest 30 million into our U.S. manufacturing base. Non-alcoholic brews and taprooms weren't a thing before athletic in the country. We built the first one, and since then we've built them that are 100 times the output of the original brewery on both coasts and in that world. We have found really good access to private to capital in the private markets. But ultimately it is really exciting for us to think about potentially being a public company or running a long term private company. Yeah, I want to ask you more about that. But first I say the marketing is brilliant because you're you know, you're a non holic brewery, but you're targeting athletes and people who go for hikes and, you know, serious mountaineers and dog lovers and outdoorsy people. I mean, it's just it's amazing. So what is the trajectory that you see before going public? I mean, are you going to open breweries around the country? Are you going to have, you know, bars? Is that is that something that can be profitable not to the bottom line or, you know, is it better to have people just subscribe and sort of have, you know, beer as a service south jersey? Yeah, Well, in terms of our target customer, we basically built the target customer around my lifestyle because I was authentically living this as a busy professional love the outdoors that is, 70% of the population considers themself an athlete, even though you'll never find me on any podiums anywhere. I love being out there and participating. And so it was really about that health and wellness trend. And then, yeah, beyond that, our our awareness is still very low. It's about 25% nationally. So we have and our distribution is only about 39% with our top product where a lot of the major beer companies, even in our category, even though athletics the number one, have double our distribution. So we have a huge amount of awareness and distribution to go over the next five, ten years. And that allows us we also are trying to open the aperture to who drinks beer, where beer over the past 30 years had been marketing to smaller and smaller audiences. And so this January bring plans to we're working with OpenTable with a big partnership to expand into the culinary world. Chefs and athletes and stuff. Build awesome stuff. Great story. We really appreciate you taking the time out. Come to visit us.

How did hedge funds do in general and what strategies did best? I mean, these are all very initial numbers. It's just day one of the new year, the first working days. So we still don't know many of the numbers. But looking at initial figures, it seems that 2025 proved to be a very, very strong year for some of the largest hedge funds in the world hedge fund as a whole. They seem to be heading to record their best returns since in at least five years. And with some luck, it may be the best year since 2009. Even if they make on an average about one percentage point, then, you know, we are looking at returns which are best since 2009. And a lot was going in favour of some of these largest hedge funds who are very well risk managed. You know, you had, you know, tariffs and trade war that induced volatility across markets. Stocks surged. You were just talking about AIG. So that definitely helped a lot of hedge funds. Then you had precious metals doing well and bond and currencies switching. So all combined to create this like sort of a perfect spring for hedge funds in 2025. Yeah, I don't think they should be patting themselves on the back. I mean, everybody made money seemingly in 2025. Stocks, bonds, us, non-U.S. commodities everywhere. What strategies, Nishant, are kind of outperforming and maybe what strategies are underperforming do we see in 25? I mean, it's hard to say which strategies underperforming. Most of them versus their own history are doing well, but it's led by equities. Macro has done really well in most of the cases, especially the emerging market, macro focused hedge funds. They have done very, very well. Most of them are in double digits. So, yeah, I mean, and the Multi-strategy as well, I mean, they don't focus just on one share asset classes, but they invest across asset classes run by dozens of teams. And some of the returns they are, you know, that they produce are really, really strong. Most of them are in double digits. And also, it's important to look from the lens of these macro hedge funds and multi strat, which we have included in our table. They are all very large hedge funds.

Shufelt highlighted that the U.S. market has grown from $100 million to over $1 billion in the past decade, with Athletic holding an 18.4% share and leading the craft segment. He attributed growth to shifting consumer preferences, especially among younger and health-conscious demographics, and noted that over 40% of consumers participate in Dry January. Shufelt outlined ongoing innovation, significant investment in manufacturing, and future plans for broader distribution, partnerships, and possibly going public. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIt's been a really fun ride. We started the non-alcoholic beer market, basically flatlined, flatline for 30 years before ten years ago where we came in and like to think we reimagined both the product and the marketing of the category, taking it out of the penalty box into the mainstream with delicious flavors. And we've taken it as a category from about 100 million to passing $1,000,000,000 in the US market this year. And we think that could continue to grow. We expected to five X in the next ten years with athletic being 25% of that market. Right now athletic is about 18.4 share the total category. The next biggest is about 14 and a half share, and that's another four point drop to the next brand behind that. Athletics also 52 share of the non-alcoholic craft beer category, which has well over 100 brands. So we're outselling the next 100 plus combined. And it's really meeting those that next generation of consumers where they're at. What's been the response, competitor response from some of the big brewers, which I can't even know the names now, they've all merged into like one big entity, I think for sure. So as you've heard on the segment before, two of over 40% of consumers are doing dry January this year. Over 50% of consumers now view one or two drinks a day as unhealthy. And a record low number of Americans are also consuming alcohol on a weekly basis. So this is a huge growth opportunity for the adult beverage market. And a lot of companies were late to that. But over the last five years, basically every major brand has entered that category with the alcoholic analog to there are non-alcoholic analog to the full strength version. And we really appreciate that support and growing the category. It's it's so funny to me because I didn't have an alcoholic beverage in my life until I was nearly 30, I think. And I wonder what makes somebody reach for a non-alcoholic beer when there are so many other drinks that are already non-alcoholic out there? For sure. It's so when we started athletic and I would try to get people to taste samples or buy one of our beers, getting people to cross that barrier was so hard seven or eight years ago. But I think the lightbulb that goes on over and over again for people is that it is such a delicious meal pairing at a fraction of the calories as a full strength alcohol equivalent. For example, we were just talking about before I came in, how our athletic light is 25 calories, no sugar, light and carbs, but a full taste that's like a perfect guilt free weeknight beer. And then we brought a ton of innovation to the market, too. For example, we're now launching an excited lineup of non-alcoholic brewed cocktails this January at select retailers like Target and all these different fun flavored and like, well, it give us a foretaste. Yeah. So we have after the athletic light lager we have an athletic lite Lyman Salt launching this year and in a typical year we launch almost 50 different styles of beers on our website. Athletic Brewing become where before Athletic Brewing this category was a lager only category. So from day one, we've really blown the lid off what taste and availability can be in this category. Who's typical athletic drinker customer? So when we came into the category, this category was typically a lapsed alcohol drinker. It was very male heavy as the older population generally. And since we've redefined the product and marketing of the category, we've seen that drift younger and younger. Every year. We think 45% of our consumers are below age 45, very heavy in Gen Z. Consumers really, as people have grown up in this digital generation where you have your work in your pocket at all times, everything in your life is filmed and recorded and on record and people still like to drink, but then they like the zebra stripe and working non-alcoholic options with zebra stripping. And I heard that and I forgot it already. Yeah, sorry I jumped right over that. It's basically we and this has been shocking to me. I hear from bartenders all the time that people order alcoholic drinks, not alcoholic alcohol. Oh, okay. I got you. Okay. That's a brilliant idea. You could put food in there, too. That would be a better idea. Curious, how do you do it? You have so many options. And as you say, you're trying out different ones all the time. I mean, are you very non-profitable or how does it work? That costs a lot of money? Well, at the end of the day, in our retail lineup, we're very focused. We have a core group of about five beers, which are very popular and highly awarded. We won 33 Taste awards last year alone and have won about 185 Taste awards. And, you know, there's there's been a plethora of entrants into this category from major brewers to there's been ten celebrity brands with more on the way. And almost none of these companies make their own beer, whereas Levick has gone the other way. We invested 130 million into our own manufacturing, our brewing quality teams, and ultimately, consumers like to know they want to get the best products. I'd like to know what's behind their products. And after that celebrity hype, they've really loved what they found and athletic. And so we really try to stay focused on our retail lineup and bring people the best beers over and over again. I got a. But my investment banker hat back on. How do you capitalize your company? I'm always fascinated to see how these private companies, entrepreneurial companies, how they finance themselves. Yeah, it's such an interesting I like I came from the financial world. It's such an interesting world these days between private and public capital. And we've been so fortunate to have great access to private capital, from angel investors to private equity investors like Alliance Consumer Growth and General Atlantic. And an institutional investor encouraged Dr. Pepper, and that's afforded us the opportunity over the past eight years to invest $130 million into our U.S. manufacturing base. Non-alcoholic brews and taprooms weren't a thing before athletic in the country. We built the first one, and since then we've built them that are 100 times the output of the original brewery on both coasts and in that world. We have found really good access to private to capital in the private markets. But ultimately it is really exciting for us to think about potentially being a public company or running a long term private company. Yeah, I want to ask you more about that. But first, I'd say the marketing is brilliant because you're you know, you're a non-alcoholic brewery, but you're targeting athletes and people who go for hikes and, you know, serious mountaineers and dog lovers and outdoorsy people. I mean, it's just it's amazing. So what is the trajectory that you see before going public? I mean, are you going to open breweries around the country? Are you going to have, you know, bars? Is that is that something that can be profitable not to the bottom line or, you know, is it better to have people just subscribe and sort of have a, you know, beer as a service software? Yeah, Well, in terms of our target customer, we basically built the target customer around my lifestyle because I was authentically living this as a busy professional. I love the outdoors. At 70% of the population considers themself an athlete, even though you'll never find me on any podiums anywhere. I love being out there and participating. And so it was really about that health and wellness trend. And then, yeah, beyond that, our our awareness is still very low. It's about 25% nationally.

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nVenezuela's acting President says she is inviting the U.S. to work with her country after an American operation to capture President Nicolas Maduro. The US swooped into Caracas over the weekend, seizing Maduro and flying him to New York to face drugs and weapons charges. President Trump said the US plans to run Venezuela with elections due eventually. We're going to run everything. We going to run it, fix it. We'll have elections at the right time. The main thing you have to face is a broken country. Well, joining us now is Victor Gao, Vice President at the Center for China and Globalization. Victor was ex Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's English interpreter in the 1980s. Victor, good to have you with us. What's your sense? How does Beijing view the strike that the US made on Venezuela? I think China condemns such an act of aggression and intrusion into a sovereign country and hijacking or abducting a head of state and the first lady. This is purely, in China's view, a violation of the international norms, relations and a violation of the United Nations charter. And if the United States can do this to Venezuela, United States, or any other country, it can do similar things to any other country. And what really drives President Trump and the US government is to seize the oil assets in Venezuela. Now, this is not American assets. This is Venezuela's assets. And for President Trump to pretend that he will run the affairs of Venezuela is very presumptuous in the least and also very much destabilising the international relations. If any country can do this to the oil assets of Venezuela, they can do similar things to Saudi Arabia or to Qatar or to UAE. There will be no peace and stability in the world. So I think China wants to stand on the right side of history. And the United States, apparently, in China's view, is on the wrong side of history. This will not make America great again. This will really be a very dark moment in the U.S. history and in my best judgment, history will look back upon this event as the beginning of the end of Pax Americana, because the United States, through this act of aggression against Venezuela and against the sovereign President of Venezuela, is really starting a new phase in its development. It may eventually lead to the end of Pax Americana. No one in the world wants to be dominated by a neighboring country. Victor. Might China be concerned about its own interests in Venezuela? Because by some calculations, China has lent Venezuela about 100 billion. Of course, China, Venezuela relations are very close and we cooperate with each other fully. And this is all normal contracts. And for the United States to launch such a blatant act of aggression against Venezuela is a matter of great concern to China. And China wants to call for stability. And China wants to continue working relations with Venezuela, especially with the current government. And if there will be a new government eventually in due course, of course, China wants to maintain normal relations with the future government in Venezuela. But all this is no small matter because what the United States is doing is not only negatively impacting all the legitimate business interests of China and Venezuela, it really undermines the international norms. And if this becomes a precedent, I think the United States will strike fear in many other countries in the world. And allow me to mention philosophically, striking fear is not equivalent to gaining respect. Fear is not getting respect. And the United States will be better served if it gains respect rather than striking fear in other countries.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:38:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T07:57:23.056543"}

Georges spoke with Matt Miller and Paul Sweeney on December 31, 2025. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nThe labor market always matters. I mean, it's been a very good labor market for the U.S. for the past at least four or five years. I mean, post-COVID. So people are getting nervous about the labor market, maybe too much. We saw that the latest figures showed that you don't know, you no longer have the destruction of job creation in the private sector, which is a very good thing, because a few months ago we did have the destruction in the private, the labour market and the public market made like the whole most of the job creation during the first the first semester of of the year. So that is a positive sign. We had ECOFIN do not expect the labour market to deteriorate very much in 2026. On the contrary, we think is going to get a little bit better, especially in the second half of the year and that should help the US economy going forward. Karen, You know, we all look here in the US too much probably on the US markets where we have the S & P up 17%, the NASDAQ up 21%. But boy, the returns, the equity returns in European markets are really spectacular, superior to those in most markets relative to the US. Can you give us just a backdrop on the 2025 drivers and whether they'll still be there in 26 for many European markets? Yeah, of course. Well, the main drivers of the European markets are very different from the U.S.. If you look at, for example, in terms of styles, you see value in the in the European markets much better than growth. So like in the U.S., it's the opposite. You see growth and the bodies like this. So in the European markets, it's mainly financials, defense sector, transport, so very, very cyclical markets value segment. So it's mainly value. So it's been tough for growth investors in in Europe because as you spent a few minutes ago, you have winners and losers and most European fund managers are mostly growth like they like in the U.S. So it's been a tough year for active managers in in Europe, but it's mainly financials, defense and transport. And in regards to the difference between Europe and the U.S., for us as European investors, it's even better because since we are, the euro is our main currency. So when you look at U.S. markets in euro, it's only plus 3%. So European markets are much better than the U.S. for European investor. Yeah. And if you look at European markets in dollars, it's astounding the gains that I mean, your CAC, Carol, up 25%. If I were to have invested in dollars at the beginning of the year in Germany, the DAX, I would have gotten a 40% return if I had invested in the beginning of the year, the IBEX 35 in Madrid, 17% return. Better than buying gold. Yes, right. And that's been mainly driven care and by the banks. So it's so funny to me because the years that I spent, you know, I was in living in Germany for six years until 2022, and Deutsche Bank was trading at like 0.3 times. Book How come the European banks have outperformed by so much? It's not like the EU has figured out banking union yet, right? Well, you have three main explanations. The first one is they're mainly domestic. So obviously with the trade war with Donald Trump, investors favored domestic stocks, with interest rates that remained high both in the U.S. and in Europe. Also, people want to go into value stocks. So obviously, financials are value, as you pointed out, even though price to books are now obviously higher than six years ago. So that's also a plus. And the third the third part is the fact that they're, as I said, cyclical. So if you believe in an inflection point for the European economy going forward, to answer Paul's question about 2026, it's also positive for financials because we we expect the economy to be much better than the consensus. The consensus was around 1.1 GDP growth for next year. We could see from 1.4. So it's maybe not so much for U.S. because your your GDP growth is higher, but it relatively is very good for for European markets, if that will be the scenario for next year. So we are still very positive on Europe markets for a 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:38:25 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:02:48.705373"}

Jim Craige, CIO and Head of Emerging Markets at Stone Harbor Investment Partners, said his firm has been investing in Venezuela for the past year. He discussed the potential implications for emerging markets on Bloomberg ETF IQ with Scarlet Fu, Katie Greifeld and Eric Balchunas. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nYou guys have an ETF Vertis. Stone Harbor Emerging Markets High Yield Bond ETF. The Tickers V and Y where you have a 2% allocation to Venezuela. How does the news of the weekend change how you move forward? The news is very significant. So we began adding to Venezuela a little over a year ago and since then it's up a little over 100% and today it's up 30%. So the implications are the defaulted debt that we own in the fund and across our strategies has increased significantly in price, and it should continue to do so. It's trading at $0.35 on the dollar, and the claim value is between one and a half and two times that. So you do a pretty simple restructuring where we expect a lot of value out of this. And, you know, we've seen South America going through a lot of changes. Are you bullish on South America in general, buying more of the debt there? Because I see you have a lot of other countries in your portfolio. What's your take on the whole continent? Most definitely. We're very bullish on Argentina, ten and a half percent yield. We're very bullish in Ecuador, nine and a half percent yield. But more broadly, the region should continue to do very well. EMA broadly should grow two and a half to 3% above the US. I mean, Latin America will be a big part of that. So we're very excited about Latin America. On the flip side of that, I mean, digesting the news from this weekend, obviously you would think this has a lot of implications for em broadly. Are there any regions, are there any countries where you would de-emphasize the debt here? I think oil exporters more generally are probably something We don't want to be overweight right now, and that's because we would expect the supply to increase because of the Venezuela exposure. We're already in an oversupply market right now anyway, so this will not help. So we're not as bullish on oil exporters more generally. You're up that 50% since the fund came out beating EMH. Why? Congrats. What percentage of that is the currency versus the debt itself? It's all the debt. So everything is dollar denominated. Empire has done quite well. But but the dollar denominated debt is also done quite well. But let's say it wasn't like how much currency are you saving then by being in dollars? So you're saving a fair amount in the currency. The currency has a fair amount more volatility and real rates are very high. So I do think there are opportunities in places like Brazil potentially, and Colombia as well. South Africa, you had said that you were buying Venezuelan bonds about a year ago, so you had this inkling that this was a good time to start loading up. And it feels like there's very much asymmetric upside here to the to that debt, especially if there is a restructuring. What is your timeline here for restructuring? I would expect it's going to be 18 months to 24 months. Somewhere in that time frame might be positively surprised. But there's the restructuring, which will be significant for the default, the debt, but also just the amount of investment that's going into Venezuela will be staggering. So high conviction, it sounds like, when it comes to Venezuela, when it comes to what we're seeing unfold here. But that being said, what risks are you monitoring as it pertains to this situation? Well, it definitely could have a a transition that is more disorderly. It's not our base case, but that's certainly a risk that bears watching. So we spent a lot of time talking to political analysts and others in the Treasury and State Department, etc., to try to get a handle on that. But we're very confident that that's not likely. But 45 seconds, I was looking at the return attribution of your fund. The best performing country is Lebanon. Today I learned this. What's going on there? That's so good. Sure. Similar to Venezuela, you have defaulted bonds that are trading in the twenties and your claim values double that. So right off the bat, you've got a lot of upside embedded in the price, but also you've got some transformations there. It is part of the economic team in Lebanon is a good friend of ours and and a former competitor. So a lot of respect for him. But also they just passed a GAP law which allows for some of the bank debt restructurings to be recognized and dealt with. So we're very bullish on law on Lebanon long term.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:21:50 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:33:02.404321"}

Yet no major exchange has agreed to list it, according to Matt Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital. Bloomberg's Isabelle Lee discussed the story on \"Bloomberg ETF IQ\" with Scarlet Fu, Katie Greifeld and Eric Balchunas. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nTell us a little bit about what this ETF, the proposed ticker is graffiti aims to do. So this was filed in June. We wrote it because it was cheeky. It was new. It's like graffiti, grift. And then the ETF name is Government Grip. It's designed to target firms with political ties to Washington. So Matt Tuttle, the CEO of the issuer behind this, said they will scrape speeches, whether it's commentaries or they will look at the companies that members of the Congress disclose basically anything. And it's not specifically tied to any politician or any administration. He just says that I want this to be could translate political influence into investable insights. So that was in June and we were waiting when will it launch? And then so I was asking him and asking him in waiting. And then months after we found out that the exchange wants to list it. So a big no from the three exchanges reportedly. What is the path forward here for Matt Tuttle and for this fund? I think if it's a no, then he there's nothing you can do. So according to him, his only hope is Texas. So it remains to be seen. Texas exchange, which is set to start operating, I think earlier, early this year. But if not that, I asked him, what about Canada, What about others? Are you open to rebranding it and stuff? But he said no, he wants it to be grift for now. He wants it to be bigger. So he doesn't want to change the name of it or the ticker for it. Eric Can an ETF actually launch as an ETF without an exchange behind it? No, not really. I mean, that's the whole point of the name exchange traded fund. So it wouldn't be an ETF at that point to be like a GBTC. Now, Nance, by the way, to me seems equally cynical. This is the Democrat trading ETF and it's got 260 million. So it's interesting if Cruz is the GOP one Nance has the more assets and does better though they've drew a line with grift. I think Texas will list that the people who run the Texas exchange are from CBOE and I think they were the most liberal of the three exchanges. So I have hope there. But if not, you know, this is such a total story. I'm holding out for his alien tech ETF. And you said this is the first ETF you can think of that all the exchanges rejected. I've never heard of this. This is like, you know, like gangster rap back in the day, like Walmart wouldn't carry the album or something. It's like, I've never heard of this, but this feels very on brand with Matt Tuttle, right? Yeah, it's a little bit of a provocateur. Very much so. But it's interesting because last year Katy wrote a story that it's a record year for launches, flows and volume. But now Eric was the one who said it's also it's like the parents are saying no because the ETF industry is like a teenager pushing boundaries using Eric's words.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:47:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:53:40.627063"}

He speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat's the Trump view of the Monroe Doctrine or the Trump iteration of the Monroe Doctrine? What does that look like? Well, as usual, with this administration, we've had very conflicting accounts on precisely what that is. You had Rubio essentially saying other other countries, adversaries, the U.S. need to stay out of the Western hemisphere. He said they are not going to allow a situation where Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world, would be controlled by adversaries such as Russia or China. And then President Trump, when asked about that, basically said, you know, sure, Western Hemisphere and all that. But this is really about an individual country. And everything we hear at this point is essentially in the president's thinking, it was based on a real direct animus he had with Nicolas Maduro. I mean, what you see now essentially is them allowing the vice president, Delsey Rodriguez, to become the acting president. And, you know, she comes essentially from the same group, the Chavistas that Maduro belonged to. So we may see a change in policy from Venezuela under U.S. pressure, but we're not really seeing a major rotation in the in the group of people who are ruling the country, aside from Maduro himself. Right. Big changes need to happen for there to be a different direction for Venezuela going forward. Having said that, Nick, I wanted to ask you, how important is Venezuela to U.S. national security? You know, it's a great question, Carol, because there are a lot of conflicting accounts on that. I mean, if you ask an international law expert, they would say there is no direct threat to the United States from Venezuela. You would essentially need Venezuela to basically be attacking the United States to put forward an argument for self-defense. But, you know, this administration has taken a much more expansive view of U.S. authority, saying that the drug running that they allege was passing through Venezuela was killing thousands and thousands of Americans. And then they also say, you know, the oil issue and the and the influence of U.S. adversaries. So they have argued that Venezuela was cultivating ties with Hezbollah and Iran and China and Russia, and they're not going to allow those adversaries to gain a toehold in the Western atmosphere. And so, therefore, there was a direct threat to the U.S. national security. And, you know, that's really the sort of the foundation on which a lot of the U.S. legal arguments rest in this case for the sort of stepped up aggression against Venezuela. So they're really leaning into that. But, you know, in terms of a direct existential threat to Americans based on what we would conventionally think of as what constitutes the use of force in self-defense, the legal experts argue that it's just not really there. What about when it comes to what's actually happening on the ground in the experience of Venezuelans and to what extent the administration actually has that in mind? I was struck that we didn't hear much of that during the press conference in the past when the U.S. has played a role in ousting leaders. It's talked about the role of democracy and humanitarian challenges and countries and use that as a way to talk about why regime change was important. And now we're getting reporting that from our Bloomberg News team. Venezuela Regroups with New President. Old repression tactics the government has detained. On Monday morning and early afternoon, at least two, at least seven journalists and members of the press. What's the relationship there? Well, no, certainly, I mean, we have not seen the administration put forward the idea of human rights or concerns over democracy as a major reasons reason for this. And, you know, that's evidenced by the fact that aside from Maduro, as I mentioned, they've basically left the rest of the regime in place. And by all accounts, at least from our reporting, it looks like the the regime is is essentially cracking down on any notion of dissent. So we don't really get a sense that that's driving things. On the other hand, the administration has also said, you know, Maduro was an illegitimate president and they cite the election whereby it's widely believed that he got the return to the presidency via illegitimate means. But then that's contradicted on the other side by the fact that President Donald Trump has essentially said, you know, Marina, Maria Conchita Machado's is they don't believe that she can she's strong enough to essentially be the president, even though it was her group, her proxy, who international observers believed essentially won that election. So it's a lot of conflicting talk from the administration and the president and his administration really putting the emphasis on the oil and this drug running idea and the idea that this was strictly a law enforcement operation against Nicolas Maduro himself. The other thing, Nick, that we've been thinking about, you know, why Venezuela, but also and Erik Schatzker brought this up, like why is this happening now? When I think about the last couple of weeks and how much time we spend talking about. The Middle East again. And Israel and Gaza. Certainly Ukraine and Russia. I'm just curious, you know, why this is happening now. You know, again, a question that we have been trying to answer for a long time. We do know that the Trump administration had sought to pressure Nicolas Maduro to leave power in the in the first term. So there was a maximum pressure campaign and a push to recognize then opposition leader Juan Guaido in administration at the official time were saying, you know, Maduro is on his way out. It could be weeks, certainly no more than months. We then had a lull during the Biden administration and this sort of came back to the fore under the second Trump administration, where you have elements of the administration like Marco Rubio, who draws a direct line between Venezuela and Cuba, where he wants to see that regime ushered from power. But then a lot of the reporting we saw, we've also seen in the last several days suggest that there had been a long conversation between the U.S. and elements within Venezuela to push for a negotiated exit for Maduro, based in part and sort of pushed in part by some of these views within the administration. And Trump, for one reason or another, basically ran out of patience. And it felt that an even stronger degree of animus toward Maduro himself and so just decided to go ahead with it. And it was really nothing. No, not any sort of broader or strategic resonance beyond that.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:28:37 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T23:45:13.968035"}

Despite the global headwinds, Matthieu Wiltz said the sentiment is 'positive' for 2026. He spoke exclusively with Bloomberg's Anna Edwards, Tom Mackenzie and Guy Johnson from Paris. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat is the mood, Max, here when it comes to dealmaking prospects in 2026? Thank you, Tom. And thanks online as well for having me this morning. So clearly, the letter, the sentiment is positive and we see the pipeline that we have both in money and in in IPO is very robust. We had a very strong year last year outside of the, let's say, three months post tariff announcement. But since the month of August, we see, you know, the peak of activity and we think that 2026 should be a good year for IPO. Again, there is strong demand from the from the markets. When we listen to clients as well, there is a real willingness to to come to the market and benefit from from from that window. As you said as well. We are in the middle of doing a European tool. So with some of my partner and we are traveling across Europe this week and Middle East next week trying to be with clients on the early part of the show as well and make sure that we stay close to them, We listen to them and we try to help them to navigate into that difficult geopolitical landscape. Markets are doing well, but clearly the geopolitical points are clearly more difficult to anticipate and navigate. But we are bullish. To your question, clearly on our capacity to deliver more IPO this year. Well, Matthew, you bring in the geopolitics. So let's go to that and of course, the unprecedented events in Venezuela. Has that has that changed, changed the view that the teams view, the House view? How are you thinking about that in terms in terms of the impact, the economic impacts, the risk impact, maybe the impacts on deal making as well? Has it adjusted your outlook for 2026 this so. So this one is difficult to assess right now. That just happened. We see that when we look at the market and the performance of the market yesterday, equities did pretty well. We look at the issuance as well because we expect a strong January as well for issuance. Just yesterday in the US, we issued more than 61 billion of bonds, but the markets as a whole and credit spread are doing extremely well. Even if those volumes are impressive, when we look at the at the Brent yesterday, it was relatively stable. We have a target at $58 for the end of 2026. So decrease from where we are at the moment. But clearly that was Venezuela. We have to reassess. We are looking at that. We have our reserve team. We don't expect based on the on the market reaction, I mean, any significant drop now when we analyze the situation, everything will depend of how strong the US will be into the the day to day politics in Venezuela. Because if you look at it, Venezuela is one of the biggest sale. So if you take Venezuela plus the US plus part of Guyana as well, that means that if the US are really driving that, they're going to potentially influence 30% of the of the crude production. So that definitely will have an impact. But it's very early stage and difficult to assess for the moment, but that's something that we monitor every every minute now. Okay. Good morning to you. As you said, the geopolitical situation very much in flux under review as you describe it. Clearly, the fiscal impulse here in Europe, thinking about your your emir geography, the fiscal impulse is certainly an area of focus. And I noticed that you are opening a new digital bank in Germany this year. I wonder what your hopes and dreams are for that fiscal push in Europe and what can it what it can deliver for it for for banks and for J.P. Morgan? So I think that and I'm a European citizen and I've been a gypsy for 25 years, but I've been always in Europe and I'm a strong believer in Europe and the fact that we can do more. When we listen to the Draghi report and we are definitely 100% aligned to what has been affirmed and proposed. We think that with more cooperation, more elements, stronger leader in Europe, Europe can do better. And we live in a world where now economically we have to fight against the US, Asia, part of the Middle East as well. So I think Europe getting together is definitely a must. So and you could think that it's counterintuitive for a US bank to say that because you could think that we would benefit from from more, let's say, fragmentation in Europe. But this is completely wrong. And Jamie Dimon has been very vocal about it as well, having a strong Europe, having more cooperation, having stronger leaders. But that means that in Europe, every country need to accept that they may win in one industry. If we have more M & A and maybe France will have more finance or automaker or healthcare, maybe Germany will do something in Italy or the Netherlands. But we need to make sure that, like authorities and company are allowed to for M & A and cross-border activity. And if we have stronger player in Europe, that's going to be the only way that we are going to be influential, let's say globally against the big player in the other regions. And that's one of the areas where many have been trying to craft some cross-border M & A has been within the banking sector. We heard from a European commissioner recently, Matthew, who was saying that actually it is US banks that managed to navigate the fragmented banking landscape across Europe better than perhaps the the European ones do, because they are partly because they are outsiders. I mean, does that chime with your experience? Do you find as Americans in Europe, it's relatively easy to navigate that fragmented banking landscape? I would not say that. I think that when we talk to clients and I think most of the feedback that we receive from clients is like several of the American banks and Jp morgan being the first one, we've been consistent and we deliver like very strong support and services even during volatile periods. During the global financial crisis, during COVID, we were always there and we never scaled back from our positions. And we have that role across all countries in Europe. The issue that we see in Europe for some of the European players is like it's very hard for them to be strong in every country. Many of them are very strong in their country, but it's very hard to be to have a presence and to be a leader in every countries. And that's why we think that we need more women and we need for Europe to have stronger player and cross country player. So you could see that in a way that would go against our position and maybe against our market share. But we think that having a stronger leader at the end will increase the wallet and will be better for the business overall for Europe. And as JPMorgan in that current environment, we think that we will be alongside some of the strong European banks having having, let's say, most of the market share and do it do a good business in that environment. So that's why we are we are so pushing for more consolidation and more cross-border, I mean, in Europe as a whole. Yep. Matthew, good morning. It's Guy. Couple of questions on the credit market. How much how much of what you guys are going to do this year is going to be datacenter origination in credit is how different does the market in Europe look compared with the United States or Asia? What is the story here in Europe when it comes to that part of that segment of the market? So, I mean, clearly the it's been a big theme last year both in Europe and in the US. But that doesn't the financing we've done a lot. There is truly needs as well also for for CapEx expenditure. That's one place that we like. We want to continue to do business. I know that there is some noise about the fact that we could have a bit of a, let's say, boom at some point in the in the area. That's why we need to be cautious as well. And I think that's the nature of our business, is to be with clients alongside them and give them liquidity when they need to do investments, capital expenditure, but also make sure that we choose the right partner. And I think that based on our experience, because we've been in the credit market for more than 200 years, from private to public, we have that experience. And I think that's the benefit as well. For clients who work with partners like Jp morgan is that we can deliver on the whole range of products. If you want to do private and more private transaction, we've like a very different set of investors. We can deliver on that. If you want to do more public transaction broadly syndicated, we can deliver on that and we have the experience and that's why we are trying to demonstrate because that market is changing with new newcomers as well. So we have to fight to protect capital. Are getting the I'm getting the sense here that maybe you think that some people aren't being careful enough in this space. Clearly, these are not Jp morgan clouds. Of course not. But do you think there are others that maybe aren't being maybe quite as quiet as doing that diligence as well as they should? Maybe. I think it's maybe I mean, for sure. And we see that every day in the market. We are not trying to hide as well. And I think when we published our results a quarter ago, I think Jamie has been very open as well and transparent about the situation we had with tricolor in the US. So I'm not trying to hide and I think issues can happen to everyone. I think that was also a good reminder that for all of us internally that we need to stay highly focused. We need to double check on everything. I think we live in a market today where there is an excess of liquidity to to the market overall. So that's why we need sometimes to refuse to do a transaction if we think that especially covenants are not there and do not give us enough comfort. There is also a big is that more and more co-investing are coming with us or with some of the private equity player. So we were already doing it for us. But having co-investors that put even more pressure on us to make sure that we do the right due diligence and to and that we do invest and lend only where we are 100% comfortable.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:31:08 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T09:42:56.419173"}

Instead of panicking over the Venezuela incursion, traders are focusing on AI growth, potential rate cuts, and a stabilized oil supply. Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights spoke to Bloomberg’s Horizons Middle East and Africa anchor Joumanna Bercetche on the new world order created by President Trump. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nRachel, good to have you with us. And I know we can discuss so many different things from the geopolitical ramifications, the market ramifications of what has gone down at the start of this year. Let me start with the geopolitical question and whether you think this so-called new world order that people are talking about or the dawn role doctrine that President Trump has introduced in Latin America, do you believe that this is going to intimidate or will it actually embolden some of the other authoritarian regimes around the world? Jumana, pleasure to be with you. Happy New Year. It's been quite a busy start to the year for all of us. I think it may embolden other sizeable continental powers like China and Russia in their own spheres of influence, even as they're facing more pressure in the Western hemisphere that the U.S. has indicated is part of its sphere of influence. You know, we continue to have questions of what, you know, how seriously President Trump is taking the end to the conflict in Ukraine and, you know, where China is concerned. They don't want a new trade war, but they're there. You know, maybe there are lots of questions about lessons for Taiwan. Yeah. And I think what was interesting in all of this is at no point at any point in the last couple of days that Trump even mentioned the word democracy. This was not a takeover that was fought on ideological grounds. It was pragmatic. And I think they've been pretty clear and transparent about the need to get access to Venezuela's oil. The announcement overnight that Venezuela is going to send over 50 million barrels to the US. How again, do you think this changes the world's calculus and the relative power nexus in the world that you follow very closely, which is energy and energy supply? Yeah. I mean, in a way, there are two things. One, I'm reminded of the fact that just over a year ago, you and I met and Dubai on this program and we talked about drill, baby, drill. And the place in the world that we're drilling is not up is actually the United States. The domestic supplies are, you know, sort of are stalling. But elsewhere in the hemisphere, this is really increasing in a way. I see this sort of transfer of barrels as both a down payment from Venezuela, but also it's a, you know, and maybe an extorted down payment, but it's also a way to avoid a shut in of production as the US maintains this blockade. Venezuela was running out of storage space because they weren't able to sell the oil to China. When we look at the amount here, this is a sizable amount, but it's, you know, 50 million barrels. That's equivalent to about a fifth of what the U.S. imports every month. It's about two months maybe of Venezuelan exports to China, a little bit less than that. So the big question is also how quickly this comes and whether U.S. business is going to be ready and interested to invest in Venezuela. But overall, we're really seeing a Donald Trump wanting cheaper, you know, cheaper oil and, you know, a might makes. Right. A pragmatic trend, as you say. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you have a brilliant substack, which I enjoy reading very much. And it's called Weaponize the Economy. And I think this is really the manifestation of that weaponizing the economy. And I just wonder, Rachel, whether, you know, you look at the price action in precious metals, industrial metals, the massive run up we've seen in copper and others the last couple of months, do you think that that is an expression of that of some sorts and the fact that there is a global sovereign race to get their hands on these critical minerals and on these critical metals that are so key for the transition and also for for I. Yeah. And copper is linked in to electrification across the board. If anything, even as global oil demand is flattening, demand for power is not. It is going up to the data center demand due to all of the electronics that run our lives. And copper in particular has both a demand story but also has had supply shocks beyond copper. I think what we're really seeing is a push to build out more processing, particularly for critical minerals. And then of course we've got gold and we've got silver, which are much more of a sort of inflation play, I might say, and are really the way that people are trying to play a potentially weaker dollar and to play this these questions of central bank independence and whether the US economy will be run hot going forward. So I do think there's still, you know, probably not going to see as big a run up in gold as we did. And in 2025, it's kind of hard to repeat. But a number of these metals we should continue to see some support for. Yeah. Rachel, always great to have you on and happy New Year to you.

Zinc has given us a lot of talk about the last 12 hours or so after the best best day in over three years. And of course, just in case you missed that, iron ore, as you can see, is also playing, playing a bit of catch up to 50. Futures coming on line on your screens shortly will be the nickel contract in Shanghai. And of course, the separate story in China has been this melt up in yields where the 1.9% handle on a ten year yield very much in focus. We could take that out. That's a three month high on ten year yield and of course, on a 30 year future. We talked about this yesterday hitting the lowest level, 30 year bond futures, specifically the lowest level since 2024. Headline pricing as well. The Bloomberg terminal on the Philippine peso has taken out that recent high on dollar peso. The currency is now trading at a fresh record low against the US dollar. Yeah, so much has changed in last few hours, David. I think we were what we were going to talk about, you know Asia stocks having the best start ever are really for 2026. But really it's been changed to what we've seen here with oil. Now, even that drop that we've seen on that news, a President Trump says Venezuela will send the US as much as 50 million barrels of oil, which would then be sold with the proceeds to benefit both countries. Let's bring in Steven Substance. He joins us now for the details of this. Steve, it it's interesting because, you know, just yesterday we're asking all these questions of who's going to run Venezuela, who's going to be. It seems like the U.S. has signaled that they, in fact, will be directing who pumps the oil and who they sell it to as well. Give us more about these details. Yeah, I mean, certainly. So let's just look at what he said a few moments ago. The president posted on social that they're going to be looking to take 50 million barrels of oil from from Venezuela, as much as 50 million barrels from Venezuela. To put that in the context, Venezuela produces right now about 800,000 barrels a day. And it's unclear exactly where that would come from. Is that stuff that's being produced right now, is that oil that's on the water? He said it sanctioned oil. So maybe this is this is oil that's already in tankers, but we have a few analysts and experts kind of scratching their head on exactly what that means. But clearly, the signal is Trump wants to put the US flag in on oil assets in Venezuela. There are also reports from other news agencies that he wants the country to sever ties with with China, with Cuba. China is a major investor as well in oil and in Venezuela. At the same time, The Wall Street Journal was reporting that the president will be having meetings with officials from Exxon, Chevron and other US oil producers about investing in Venezuela. So clearly it is a full court press with the Biden with the Trump administration in terms of getting some some American more of American presence there. You have to note that Chevron has been there for decades. They're still there. They produce by 25% of the oil that's exported from Venezuela that's not sanctioned. Can expand that. That's that's a big question that we're going to be looking at. Absolutely. It it seems markets are moving along two dimensions, right to your point. One is headline risk. And we're not really sure where and when and how the oil actually shows up in the market. But to the latter point, you just made their statement on just how much CapEx and where the conversations are with oil majors, US oil majors, specifically in terms of how they can get involved in getting the oil out of Venezuela, Where is that conversation now? You know, I think when we first saw the the the actions over the weekend of of Trump and the administration taking auto and and kind of saying that they're going to essentially be running the country and they're going to be paying for it with with Venezuelan oil. When Bloomberg reporters in the US were reaching out to their sources and what's been reported in our stories, they were bit caught off guard. There have been no agreements to expand production there. That being said, they are studying it and we have trading houses as well, you know, studying it. We've reported that. I think the discussions are early. I think a lot of it's going to go down to as well. What is the Trump administration going to offer? What kind of guarantees, what kind of cash are they going to get? Because with Brent, look at this, we got Brent coming down to $50 right now. You know, when when you're at that level, does it make sense to be investing in oil production in a country where costs are pretty high? You're going to need to invest a lot, $10 billion a year for ten years to boost production to where it used to be in the early 2000, according to some analysts. And then on top of it, you look at other places in the world, you've got other shale assets that are maybe more attractive. You have to deal with the geopolitical risk, maybe the CapEx, you have to spend quite as much. So you're going to the Trump administration is really going to have to convince the Chevron's and the Exxon's to get into Venezuela. I don't think they're exactly rushing in right now. That's not the sense that that we're reporting. Yeah. Steven, based on that report about Trump possibly wanting Verizon to sever ties with the likes of China, given that they are the biggest importer of Venezuelan oil, what do you think the response is going to be? I mean, from from the beginning, the Chinese. You know, China has been saying that that this was unfortunate, that the US acted illegally, unilaterally in a way that doesn't fit international laws. So the China will likely continue to hit back, at least in terms of of their statements. But let's take a step back. Venezuela produces about 1%, less than 1% of global oil supply. And China, while they were buying quite a bit on shadow fleet vessels that had been sanctioned, that's only about 4% of China's oil supply. And China is able to look elsewhere. We're entering a year of an oil glut and there's plenty of oil. The market is awash with crude. And so Chinese tea pot, smaller refiners can find alternative supplies. So do the Chinese even really want to be buying when they're such a large presence? And there's a geopolitical risk and the Trump administration is making everything so unpredictable. Why buy these barrels that could be boarded by by US military or U.S. Coast Guard? Why? Why do that when in fact you can just buy from someone else where you don't have that geopolitical risk? So will Venezuela be cutting ties with China or will it be the other way around? Well, China, just when they look at everybody in the playing field, maybe they'll just go somewhere else. Fantastic. Steve INSKEEP, thank you so much, Steve INSKEEP Shinseki there. He leads our Asia energy coverage to our other big stories. The geopolitics also playing out across these markets is what's taking place between China and Japan here. So Japan has made a formal protest over China's move to ban exports of items that could have military uses. It is the latest flare up in diplomatic tensions between the major Asian economies over the comments from the Japanese prime minister last year on Taiwan. Let's bring in Tim Miller, a China correspondent here with us on set to help us understand what the Japanese response has been. Well, Japan is obviously opposed to this is it has asked China to withdraw those measures. What China does next will be something to watch about the export control measures is pretty sweeping. It includes over 800 items from chemicals to equipment that are used in aviation and shipping. And so, you know, it could potentially have far reaching consequences because the language is pretty vague. It says it's targeted at Japan's military, but also any other end uses that help to boost Japan's military. So a lot is going to depend on how China interprets this and whether it applies it strictly or liberally. And it could potentially impact everything from automakers to equipment manufacturers. But in terms of size and scope, you compare this to 2010 when China also placed a limit on the exports of the scope. This time is more narrow because the last time they haven't, they had limited it to just the military uses. What could happen next. Is there a risk that there would be retaliation from Japan? Yes. Well, you you think about you know, it really depends on whether the two sides come to the table, because we know China wants Japan's prime minister to retract those comments and she hasn't done so. But in terms of what Japan can do in its military, in its toolbox, we know the two countries are very closely intertwined because Japan is China's second largest export destination. It is also its third largest source of imports. It sells a lot of machinery equipments to China. And where Japan really dominates is in the semiconductor industry. If Japan places its own export controls, that it could cripple China's chips ambitions. And then you also got to think about the wildcard, which is whether or not President Trump will respond to this, because Japan and the US are very close allies is the US also joins the fray that could tilt the power balance towards Japan. All right. Thank you so much. Below there on the latest on the two stories playing out quite, quite clearly across assets this this, this Wednesday. Right. We're about 90 minutes to the opening bell. We'll see what how that plays out, of course, across Chinese markets ahead of that. That will be live. And we're back in Vegas at six with TDK CEO. And what a sight to. We'll explain why they're betting big on this next wave of physical air. I pictures right now out of Vegas where currently. Okay. Well currently things are buffering. That's one step that we should be seeing. Of course, the the the noble boss there. We'll bring that to you a bit later on. And also, we'll be hearing, of course, from the CTO, Lenovo, CTO, about their business outlook. Much more ahead. Suffice to say, this is the China show. Good morning. Let's talk about TDK. That's the Apple battery supplier in Tokyo. It's it's moving into smart glasses. It's putting it in direct competition with a lot of Chinese rivals. Also in the space, this race to produce the lightest wearables. On our co-anchor of course, is live for us at CES in Vegas with someone perhaps, who can maybe maybe tell us more Sherri. Yeah. You could just see your proposal as more yes to the case. You'll notice how it is here with us to talk us through all of their latest innovations and of course, what to expect when it comes to 2026. Thank you so much for joining us today. Yahtzee. Happy New Year to you. Happy New Year to you, too. And really, when it comes to tDCS is very interesting because we've always linked you to cassette tapes, but now your branding is being in everything in electronics parts, but also making things better. Tell us a little bit about that tagline and how that really reflects what you do. Yeah, actually, as a part of our long term vision to get transformation, that we have also made kind of transform formation from branding. Right? And you know, we already stopped manufacturing the tapes more than ten years ago. But instead of that, we have become a completely B2B company being inside. Right. And, you know, we are committed, you know, to be inside and be better forever basically will never come. Because the thing is that customers don't necessarily see it from the outside, but you have all of these sensors, microphones, power storage and of course, these air smartglasses. Now that you're partnering with, tell us a little bit more about that. Oh, thank you for pointing out this one and in your pocket. I have to ask you, actually, you know, this CSC is not our theme is a ecosystem ecosystem. And the message we are delivering is that, you know, tech is an enabler and the TDK is committed to shape A from leading because that's interesting. You're not necessarily manufacturing the smart glasses, but being inside these in Ableton. Yeah. And today we actually made a press release called The Eyesight Eyesight. This is a kind of a core solution for next generation of, you know, smart glass and also human centric. The device that you know, I intent I intent. Right. Right. Yeah. Plus our cutting edge sensor technology component technology we are able to provide such kind of the, you know, solution to this application, the technology coming from soft eye, which you acquired last year, do you have any more plans for M & A this year? At this moment, no concrete plan. We are now making out, you know, uniting that the software resources like custom chip and also like a coming up and a software together with other, you know, components, sensors, etc., etc., making us a kind of a solution towards this, you know, smart glass, high density energy is very important. And being able to fit everything in a very tiny little equipment. Right. Which is what you do, especially with your anode silicon and the battery technology. Right. Your work on your fourth generation right now, When can we expect those and you're working on your fifth generation as well? Right, exactly. Actually, last year we would actually yeah, we released Generation three, which have kind of 50% higher energy density compared to the identical like. But as we said this year, you know, middle of next fiscal term, you know indeed we are planning to needs gen four and of course next generation we are in R & D, research and development to see what will five a fifth generation look like. What are the tweaks and changes. Yeah, actually, you know, fourth generation of course, higher energy density and the fifth of course higher, as I've been telling you, better and better and better. That's what I can tell you. Now. We have seen, of course, the challenges broadly in the tech industry as well as a hike in prices. I was speaking to Samsung's president and CMO recently and he was talking about how they're raising prices as we speak because of the shortages of memory chips. Now, that doesn't necessarily hit you directly, but at the same time, what's your demand outlook from your customers? Yeah, I'm actually aware of this kind of information. And you know, toward the next fiscal time being this year, April, we keep carefully even investigating, checking the actual demand. But what I want to emphasize is that they don't we control the controllable means, as I told you, that the higher energy density, you know, high end, the kind of batteries we keep promoting, that what we can do quite well, you know, nearby, regardless of the, you know, of demand, you know, fluctuation, uncontrollable also of the strength of the Japanese yen. How does ¥1 change affect your business? Yeah, actually one in powder is one to make a change like $2 billion in terms of operating profit. So yeah, also you know although it's controllable we carefully keep monitoring and watching cheaper Japanese yen helps you. In general. In general. In general, especially because you operate in so many different markets. China being your biggest one. Yes. Which one are your bright spots for 2026? Oh, actually, I want to see on a broader basis. Of course, China remains one of the most important, you know, you know, regional area. But of course, here U.S. what Europe I want not see that you know, the market potential on a global basis as an enabler for the future. As the optimist that you are, you always use very positive words like dynamic when you describe the U.S. market. What do you expect to see this year in 2026, especially for your business here in America? Oh, I have to repeat, it's going to be dynamic. I try to always say, you know, positivity. Right. And, you know, external circumstances, you know, remains dynamic. But as I told you, this ecosystem, Right. Is going to grow regardless of any of the challenges, including tariffs, I believe. So depending on, you know, how much, you know, growth, you know, this ecosystem is going to make. But to this degree, it's sort of direct you to I think you'll be you know, I'm joined the by. SCIUTTO Really always good to talk to you. And what a pleasure to catch up with you here at CBS Las Vegas. Thank you so much for joining us. Please come to our both to read more. Yes, I will join you both very soon. CEO of TDK, here with me at CES 2026, Yvonne. They are such a dynamic interview. I love it. All right. Sorry you got to try on those glasses coming up as well. I want to see you in that Instagram. Thanks. Of course, to our team and the as in Las Vegas, of course, we're still waiting. I think I'm the Lenovo CEO is actually making that keynote speech as we speak right now on the stage there. We'll bring you some live pictures once we do have them. But here we go, pre-market looking like this here right now. But a retreat when it comes to Hong Kong, we're down about 4/10 of 1%. This is Bloomberg. All right. We're taking a look at some of your agenda today in terms of resources and like maybe some overbought signals that we're seeing across some of these Chinese markets. So maybe that perhaps that's why we are seeing a little bit of retreat and the free market in Hong Kong today, mainland turnover, certainly one thing to watch as well. We are still around close to 2% levels there, a 1.9% level on the ten year yield in China. Obviously, the China Japan tensions that seem to have added a bit more attention now just given what we saw with some of these export sort of bans. So certainly that's weighed on the Japan market. We'll see what we see in terms of rare earths and autos, which already started to fall in Japan as well. There is a soon to be sale here today of one year bonds. Our studies of data of foreign reserves and we're focusing on copper nickel producers, where we saw nickel seems to be stealing the spotlight from some of these precious metals of light, also copper as well. But take a look at what it comes to the pre market day. What do you see? Yeah, so we're very close to that level. You mentioned here on 1.9% on the ten year yield and the nickel the nickel contract in Shanghai, as you can see, is playing a massive catch up. And I think what's interesting to us and our story actually does this a really good amount of justice is, you know, the role, the major role that Asian traders, Chinese traders specifically are playing in the nickel store. Right. Substantial volumes coming through during Asian hours. And when the overnight session in Shanghai then kicks off, then you see that pick up once again. That's just to say this is one area of the market we're tracking. In fact, there's one specific stock in the pre-market already feeling the tailwinds. That's Xinjiang, Shin Shin, That's a that's a nickel specifically that has a nickel play there. As you can see, 7% in the premarket that's listed here in Hong Kong, Jiangxi Copper, because it's a broader base metals play that make up 1%. The next two slides you're going to see is more on the EV sector live. So shout me Lei Jun is talking about releasing this new as you seven vehicle model in April, unchanged for the moment for the stock. We're also watching Seattle Eneos. So the two I've announced two cooperating on long life batteries swap network. So far you've seen NIO down 2% here as well. But yeah, you're watching the China show. We'll bring you the latest as as as well. That open is also coming up next. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back. You're watching the China show. So we're looking at some weakness in the opening going here in Hong Kong. Might see the opposite. We'll see what happens, of course, with the session. Here's a big number for you. Literally 2.8 trillion. That was the renminbi. That was the turn over in the onshore markets yesterday. Just underscores the revival in that market on price and also in activity. Yeah, so we'll see. I mean, the rest of Asia is to give it a breather today. Add the oil story, given what we heard from President Trump on Venezuela, how they want the country to at least sever ties with the likes of China, Iran and Russia supposedly has sent oil prices lower here this morning. You also have that China Japan spat that has escalated just given these new export curbs when it comes to Japan with any military use. So that certainly could squeeze supplies or rare earths and other materials here. What you're seeing in the onshore market is still some green on the screens. We're up about a 10th of 1% for the CSI 300. But as David mentioned, we're very close to the 1.9%. However, the Chinese ten year yield. So we'll see. It has been rotation out of bonds into stocks of late right now. Might not translate as that closely, but we'll see. Right now, we are seeing when it comes to onshore markets, a mixed picture here across the tech space as well. But you are seeing the likes of camera coming down about 8/10 of 1%. There is a one year bond sale coming out of China today. Goldman Sachs, a pretty interesting line, basically saying, you know, expect a slow bull run or slow or bull run for Chinese stocks in 2026. They're still seeing upside, though, of 20% for MSCI China and 12% for the CSI 300 this year, driven almost entirely, they say, by earnings growth of the pause and talk about Hong Kong market and the open there so far. But they basically said when it comes to southbound flows southbound, that buying to reach $200 billion, making another record highs. What their forecasts are when it comes to flows from the mainland. So right now, Hong Kong, though, is taking a back seat. We're seeing tech on offer. They're down by 9/10 of 1%. Most of the more pronounced moves, well, seems to be Alibaba. Baidu were down close to 2% or so. So, yeah, we're maybe we're taking a bit of a pause button here when it comes to this tech rally as well. They did mention when it comes to some of these RSI, as we are looking at pretty overbought territory, things were making a bit more heated there after we did see, of course, Asia Stock's best start ever this year with Taiwan. Korea really hitting records just yesterday. So all of that taking a bit of a back seat here today. We're watching oil stocks in particular. Given the drop in oil prices that we saw after we heard that truce, social posts from President Trump, about up to 50 million barrels that they're going to get from Venezuela, certainly is going to be one thing to watch for the markets. The Shanghai crude is catching down as well. We're down two and a half percent. A mixed picture across, of course, some of these oil majors here. But certainly going to be a key question about what this means for China, which is what is the biggest oil importer of Venezuela. Right. By disruptions, he told us, you know, the oversupply everywhere around the world, perhaps there are alternatives for China to source out their crude. If you take a look when it comes to, you know, the metals space and what we're seeing, commodities, it continues to be a heated story. Right. And this time around we're talking about nickel futures. So we've gone from aluminum yesterday. Gold. Silver obviously has been on a tear. Copper as well. A nickel is the one to watch here. We are seeing futures up some 7% on the mainland is seen, John. CMC, as we say, is up some 5% and really reacting to that and the rare earths stocks as well as China doing quite well, just given, of course, the flare up and tensions that we've seen between China and Japan. Just two things to note. Okay, So the geopolitical news flow is quite heavy right now. So let me get started with this. There's an reports, if you recall about one or two weeks back, there was that there was a deal that was announced last week. To be more specific here I met a 2 billion US dollar a purchase, if you remember madness, of course, that's the artificial intelligence platform, the relocated, of course, the staff and tech to Singapore. We now understand that met well China is now reviewing that purchase. That's what we know so far based on this report coming out of the F.T.. Separately. It is separately completely different story completely separate set of of of of themes. Here you have quite a show which is the peer of tik-tok is weighing raising money. This is a Bloomberg scoop here weighing raising money in the offer bond markets for the for the very first time shares are down 1.3%. We'll bring you more details once we have more information on that. Right. We'll leave the breaking news there for now. And we'll take you straight back to Vegas, where high tech, the world's largest LiDAR sensor maker, is standing by with our tech correspondent, Bill Bell. Thanks, Dave. I was just speaking with David Lee about this co-founder and CEO of Personal Technology, about the analogy you might want to use in this situation. And I just thought your new term, which is hard launch, and that's exactly what you've done with Nvidia because it seems like you guys have actually been working on this for quite a while. Yeah, exactly. So the news came out yesterday about it. And the idea to me is like we use the analogy, it's almost like I've been secretly dating a supermodel for a long time. Even when I tell people like a No, I don't believe you. Right. Of course, the news is official now. People know that we're officially on the new Hyperion platform, which is extremely exciting, definitely for us and I think has also great for the OEM customers who are interested in taking a various solution. Here's the reason why. It's very, very important. Used to be that one OEM to think about an autonomous driving product. You top that in two sections of the software, the hardware, the data and the training and everything. Right? And then you think magically they will be put together and it will work? Well, it turns out it's a little more complex than that. So now India has this entire platform who has all the proven already working with the with vendors like us and the suppliers. It's ecosystem. So now the OEMs will know when they pick the solution. They don't have to redo the hardware, they don't have to retrain the model because the data is there. So it's making this extremely simple and streamlined and also low risk because it's proven we saw that share price move off the back. But can you just quantify it for us? What's the actual size of this opportunity for you? What does it actually mean in financial terms? We actually don't know how big this could be, but I'll give you some numbers to justify that. First of all, China China market is anywhere between 25 to 28 million cars, but the global is more than 80 million. So that's a factor of roughly three. And also on the product side, the global OEMs tend to think more higher end, more advanced, higher quality parts. And that also give you an extra benefit of being able to work with customers globally. If you multiplied them, it's actually a much, much bigger market than China alone. That's why people are more excited about it. Obviously, we're in Las Vegas and it's a huge automotive market in North America as well. But how do you think about the opportunity here, particularly, Of course, you guys have faced tensions with Washington as well? Definitely. Definitely. Well, there isn't a perfect solution to fully solve that problem. But here's what we have done, right. The first of all, we publicly announced also at Bloomberg that we are in the process of building a factory at Thailand and which will be in production early 2027. And that is going to be our new manufacturing facility to support the demand from the global OEM side. At the same time, we're also building advanced products for those platforms that the global humans required because they are doing long range, high definition level three applications which were also super excited about. And also in the meantime, of course, it's a necessary step for us to make sure that we're fully compliant with all the regulatory efforts, including on the hardware side, on the data side, and also on the software side for the software. Most people think lighter has software, but actually by the regulatory definition we have firmware, which is a software you used to control the device, but there's no data, no way in it to make sure it's compliant everywhere. So the China manufacturing for China and Thailand for global For global China. Yeah. Okay. And what's the breakdown then to anticipate? What are you actually expecting to get out of that Thailand factory today? As I said, it's still mostly China because the Thailand is not ready yet. And also, quite honestly, China has been leading the global market on the volume and also on the product side. But in the end, we do expect a more balanced mix between China and Europe and the US and a lot of the third World countries. You are the world's biggest light maker and and your market presence is felt. I know, for instance, robo sense is another one of your peers in China. They actually have to pivot some of their business away to try and capture new markets, just given the heft of cyber. But what about in the US market because Luminar is another company that recently actually declared bankruptcy. So who do you see as your competitors and what are the pressures that you see on that front as well? The competition is always going to be there because Lighter is a super important product and the market is massive. I think some people have jokingly say our biggest competition is from the people who don't want to use lighters. I feel like that's more important for us to make sure we convince those people. And today we want to do that via data. Right. And Karzai has shipped more than 2 million units and from the past few years, and most of them are saving lives like we already have public statement from the CEO of some of our custom. Are saying that in critical cases, fatal accidents by could save up to 90%. So we want people to look at the data. That's one thing, safety. The other thing is we want to people look at how far we have gone in reducing the price, because in the end it's a return and it's an investment. As you remember from five, eight years ago, that was $50,000 per liter. Now it's below $200. We feel like we've done a great service to the industry by making this reliable, effective lifesaving sensor affordable. Now that you get to that price point, you also open up new opportunities and new markets because you're not talking about a car that say 50, 60, 70,000 U.S. dollars. You're talking about maybe humanoid robot that's far cheaper. So what are the opportunities you see outside the EV space? That's great. First of all, there isn't really a a case where if you fail in automotive, you can pivot to be successful in other markets. Here's why. In the end, they leverage the same capability. It's a manufacturing, it's a vertical integration, it's a globalization. It's the ability to control the costs. They actually are the same. So for us, we're lucky that we build the strong capability from automotive and especially China automotive, which is super competitive. And then we leverage that to products outside automotive, where all are humanoid for sure. But I don't know about being cheaper for those products. And we are on the all the robotaxis for sure. And also where are all different crazy applications? One of them is lawnmowers, which is actually affordable, is like €800 or so. Right now you can buy a €800 autonomous lawnmowers in Europe with our scissor on it. So you don't have to bury the wire, You don't have to do all the the crazy things and it will just move along very, very quickly. So those are some of the applications we're looking at. But in the end, we're not tailoring a product for the market. We use the standardized technology and product and we cater to parts of different robotics applications where we feel like we can empower all of them. And the value and the margin of that business will eventually be bigger than cars. All right. Autonomous lawnmowers. I'm going to have to try and check those out here at see us. David, it's always a pleasure to speak with you. Von That was David Lee, the co-founder and CEO of Host AI Technology. Yeah. Autonomous lawnmowers. We heard about the Chinese company that does what we call vacuum cleaners as well. Yeah. So some of that stuff, the gadgets, they're now well, you can't fake it's not me leaving, by the way things that they really proposed as well. Yeah well the team also there has been talking to Lenovo right. They've been unveiling new AI products and partnerships at its annual tech World conference in Las Vegas. The CTO told Bloomberg the company is focusing on providing hybrid A.I. technology for its customers and if these opportunities and embedding the technology into robotics. Think about a future. We don't believe the future belongs to any particular device, a single device, a single model, a single agent, if you will, data the same way it's highly distributed in nature, where the data sits. When we say hybrid, I we we believe in a future where it is an ecosystem of those models, ecosystem of those devices and ecosystem of those agents that all needs to harmoniously, I think, work with one another, if you will. And we we basically want to enable that. And part of that is what we call the public eye, the general purpose models on the cloud. Part of it is private. They either personal or enterprise that may sit at the edge, you know, or and use end user devices. There's that need I guess to have on device processing and then also cloud based air solutions. So how does that actually work in practice and how is it technologically feasible as well? Ultimately, we see cloud, cloud and edge and Edge and Device II coexist. Of course, that's the foundation of the hybrid architecture overall. And so we want to be ambient, always available, sit there and in anticipation of the users intent, the users need, if you will, and really understand the context. And if you put all of those things together, remembering interactions with you, memory management and things like that, we can essentially help create the best personalized experience that that you can have part of the event as well. Lenovo has been unveiling a new range of of Motorola products. But but which ones stand out to you in particular? We're excited about the entire product line line up from the IPCC tablets as well as our new Motorola line. The most exciting part to me is the camera integration, the intelligent ambient air integration, and how does it actually work in progress at that ambient air? What does it look like from a user experience? It it think of it as a as a very user centric, simple and single interface. So whether you want to access that through your phone, through your tablet or through your PC, you're essentially interfacing with the same user interface and it has the capability to operate across platforms as well as integrate data about you through what we call a personalized knowledge base. Part of your role is heading up the emerging technology group for Lenovo. So so which ones are you focusing on in most detail? I is of course, needless to say, it's our main focus to enable our hybrid vision both for personal AI as well as for enterprise AI. But beyond that, I'm leading up research groups in robotics, so physical and embedded AI is a focus area for us. Cybersecurity, of course, is a foundational technology for almost everything that we do. That's another area. Next generation computing technologies. Is there anything that we really haven't considered yet that you think could be on the horizon? Yes, of course. I think agent in what we call agent native devices at Lenovo is an area that is active research and rapid policy and prototype development for us as well. So I anticipate two things. One, I think the interactions and interaction modalities will change as we go from traditional traditional devices and traditional interaction modalities to new form factors, maybe more voice based, gesture based, eye gazing based, whatever that is. Right. But at the same time, I think different companies are experimenting with different device categories in terms of being able to disclose to the user as possible. It's a I think this notion of sensing is going to be very important in the future to be able to really understand deeply the user and not in sort of an interrupted way, if you will. So the AI needs to be there 24 seven. That was the Lenovo's CTO, Tolga Cotillard, there with our colleague and co-anchor, of course, Annabel there in in Vegas. Now, if you are a subscriber of Bloomberg, you can we watched that specific interview that fell to stared or others. The many others, of course, that are colleagues have done it for us. Special coverage there at CBS in Vegas. TV goes the function you run be part of conversations and instant messages on the shows. Any suggestions and commentary on our coverage and if you want any specific questions, in fact, to our guests coming up here and shows, please feel free, of course, to drop them. You have our permission to slip into our DMS. This is the China show. Lydia and Siemens are expanding their partnership, using AI to transform industrial systems, and they plan to launch the first fully AI driven manufacturing sites this year. In video, CEO Jensen Huang and Siemens AG CEO Roland Bush spoke with Bloomberg about the collab. We're announcing a big partnership between us. We've known each other for a long time, but the partnership we're announcing is really a big deal. One, we're accelerating their EDA software. We're accelerating their simulation software. We're integrating A.I. technology, physical A.I. and a genetic A.I. into their teams center and their factory automation operating system. And so we're working together across this entire spectrum. When we accelerate the software, then we'll get to use it to design our chips and systems. When we accelerate their simulation software, we'll use it in our factories to simulate the thermal properties of our factories. When we integrate our automation and agent systems into their AI industrial operating system, we can then use it in our factory floors with our partners, for example, Foxconn. And so we're working across this entire spectrum together, and we're going to put the technology to use and basically as soon as we can. What's the net effect for agents and is it improves margins, efficient capital allocation? I know that might sound a bit dry, but actually right now that's the answer everyone is searching for. How is this investment in AI and use of the technology actually change things in the real world for me? Well, you announced yesterday Vera Rubin. It takes six different chips to integrate into this incredible system called Vera Rubin. And when you're done, each one of these Vera Rubin GPUs is 240,000 watts and it is ten times more energy efficient than the last generation. It is ten times more cost efficient than the last generation. But it's still the technology is insanely complicated. 115,000 engineering years came together to build this system. And so when we accelerate EDA tools, we accelerate simulation tools. And when we can eventually and I'm hoping very soon, design entire Vera Rubin systems inside a Siemens digital twin, the chance, the ability for us to create much, much more complex systems and we'll scale, we'll do it much more efficiently. And so this is really about being able to do the impossible and be able to do it impossible, the impossible right the first time. And once we we then realize that I could see real world impact. This is where it really deploys the full power and also the economic power. And it's not only in the datacenters or many factories, which we see, but also on the edge, because once you start inferencing with low latency, you bring this technology to the edge. This is a huge potential for our customers to to deploy this technology. And this includes, of course, includes hardware and where we come from, from the chips, it goes into the controllers. Some of our controllers run on chip use. Yes. And then it goes all the way to the industrial PC. Exactly. Yeah. And the envy. Now, these are these are A.I. and don't exactly supercharge it. And they can now run algorithms trained in the cloud. They can run it on the shop floor and do all that tricks. What? We talked about it in the lead time optimization and running in a planned. And that makes a huge difference. Siemens president and CEO Roland Busch there and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking exclusively with our colleague Ed Ludlow on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. Well, much more from of course, that's coming up. This is Bloomberg. All right. We're starting things off with a look at this metals rally. And the iteration today is really in the actual steel stuff and the stuff that goes into the steel stuff. We're talking about iron ore. Yeah. If you're just wondering, 100, we're closed. 110 now on the Singapore contract and how that's playing out across some of the things like steel rebar, of course, in in Shanghai. That's also playing out there. We go in the equity space from everything from silver to nickel producers. Plenty more ahead. This is the China shop. Welcome back to the second hour of the China show. Here's a look at the HCI part of the session and following the rest of the region here after what has been a record run in Asian stocks for the first week of this year, we're taking a bit of a pause or here a breather. I should pause or that's not a word. Pause button, at least when I know I don't hosers, though. Hosers. Yeah, but we're not going to get into that now. It's cold outside. Okay. The sun. But yes, it is frigid, to say the least here. So certainly I'm taking my UGG boots out, my puffy jackets. I think we were talking about fleece and suede bedsheets and our team here today. But yes, things are looking a bit cold. It's cold sentiment here as well, Dave. I mean, you add it's mostly geopolitical, right? We take a look at what happened with the oil price and what President Trump has said about, you know, taking up to 50 million barrels from Venezuela and also when it comes to China and Japan, too. Yeah, it's still unclear, though, as Steve Stapp was pointing out earlier, how and where they're going to get that, because they I think the daily output is about 850 anyway. Less than 1 million. $1,000,000. Well, we'll get the math correctly on that. But yeah, it's the temperature has cooled certainly across these these markets. Taiwan is down about 8/10 of 1%. Korea, though, is that still the Samsung story? And I think we'll we'll talk more about that. The Macquarie came out and upgraded their price target on Samsung to currently the street high of about 90% above the current level. So that gives you an indication, of course, that a runway Jakarta is coming online. The reason we're looking at that is you'll find out very shortly with the nickel rally, it's still front and center here is showing up in London, of course, in Shanghai, iron ore is also trading at about 110. So that's certainly something that's playing out across Southeast Asia in markets like the Philippines and also Indonesia. Oil, we talked about that, Brent West, Texas and Shanghai crude coming up on your screens. And we are close. We have been flirting with 62. The downside there haven't quite yet seen a clear break of that level. Perhaps that's in the immediate future. But for now, we're trading just above that on the most active contract on Brent. Yeah, let's stay on that as well. With President Trump saying that Venezuela will send the US as much as 50 million barrels of oil, which would then be sold with the proceeds to benefit both countries. Let's bring in Jill de Souza, managing editor, to talk us through how this is all going to work. Well, you're right. I think we don't necessarily know exactly how it's going to work just yet, But as you and David were just talking, this kind of figure would represent about 30 to 50 days worth of oil production. I mean, Venezuela was producing about a million barrels of oil per day. That was before the Trump blockade. Right. And again, we're talking levels that are much, much lower than historic levels. Of course, Venezuela still does sit on the world's highest proven oil reserves. But like even then, you know, we've talked to analysts who say that that may run out within a matter of a few weeks or so. So I think it's still unclear as to what exactly this represents in terms of how, you know, how the US ultimately ships this. But it is I think, you know, many of the analysts we've spoken to talking about how this is a much bigger number politically maybe than it is economically, at least at this moment. But obviously it does just show you just how unprecedented this entire situation is and also just how determined Trump is to continue to remain really, really closely intertwined with whatever Venezuela looks like as a country going forward. And it has come with very specific conditions. I think it was ABC that was reporting that they're part of the final plan would be to ask Venezuela to cut their ties with the likes of Russia and China. What do we know about that? Yes, David, so this is a really interesting one. ABC citing people familiar, saying, first of all, that Venezuela would have to exclusively partner with the United States on oil, so essentially be like their exclusive supplier effectively in terms of what this means for that quad in its relationships, it's not entirely clear what it would mean to dramatically reduce relationships with China, with Iran and so forth, but obviously that would represent a massive political realignment for Venezuela, given how much work they ultimately do with those countries. But again, just have to keep going back to the point that Trump is really, really, you know, is really intent adamant about getting involved in Venezuela. Of course, what that ultimately means, particularly when, you know, he's left, you know, Maduro's VP, now acting president, Rodriguez in charge. You know, there still is not, you know, that desire to completely oust the rest of the Doors regime, including many loyalists there. What this looks like without, you know, U.S. troops on the ground or anything like that, I think still leaves a lot of open questions here. Jill, thank you. Jill teases there from one specific front to another. And we're looking at China, Japan, the big announcement from the Chinese yesterday, the response from the Japanese shortly after it's playing out across markets. You look at Japanese autos, you look at Chinese rare earth stocks, for example. So here we got going into the last 25 minutes in a morning session and we're looking at declines across some of the big names there. Have a look at rare earth stocks also coming up on your screen. STU Yeah. So these are the ones, of course, in China, you are seeing them, most of them rallying today on the back of this, right? There was this sort of China daily report saying that the Chinese were studying tightening rare earth exports to Japan as a possible sort of sign of escalation there in despair. Chinese media also reporting, you know, certainly that to this morning. So the latest flare up in these diplomatic tensions between the two economies. Let's bring in China outside, of course, my mom in law, who, you know, obviously has been tracking all of this, as Japan has as China, to withdraw the measures. Tell us more about the impact of these export controls. Yes. So the Chinese Commerce Ministry has issued a statement saying that starting immediately, they're going to start banning dual use items meant for Japan's military. And it's a very extensive list of over 800 items ranging from chemicals to electronics to, you know, technology used in aviation and shipping. The scope is is targeted at military, but the language is a little bit vague and perhaps intentionally so, because it says it applies to any end uses that contributes to boosting Japanese military. So there's a lot of room for the Chinese government to interpret this. They could apply it to civilian companies with even the most indirect links to the military and potentially could have far reaching consequences are everything from automakers to precision instrument manufacturers and equipment makers. If you compare it to 2010, though, when China and Japan had a conflict over the Senkaku Islands, the scope here is more limited because in 2010 they had banned the export of rare earths without sort of limiting it to military uses. Our economists at Bloomberg Economics have chimed in on this amendment. A potential spiral of retaliation could ignite a full scale economic warfare where Beijing actually holds very important leverage. What are the risk of retaliation here from the Japanese? There are many tools that Japan can use because, remember, they are very close neighbors. Their economies are very closely intertwined. Japan is the second largest export destination for China and the third largest source of imports. And they are selling a lot of these advanced equipments to China. And where Japan really dominates is the semiconductor industry. If Japan places a chokehold on export controls that it could really limit China's chips ambitions. And then you've got to think about whether President Trump would step in, as well as an ally of Japan that could really tilt the power balance. And if other countries in the West are spooked by what they see as an abuse of export controls from China, it risks alienating the Chinese economy even further as well. And this is coming, as we saw, of course, a very kind of warm reception that the South Korean president did get in China, too. Yes. So it's important to see the contrast there, because China is clearly sending a clear message He is willing to use its economic might to coerce other countries that do not sort of align with the one-China principle. But president really is getting a different treatment because he has specifically reassured China that Korea is going to respect that one-China principle. And in return, China is rewarding it by reviving this ministerial level economic dialogue that has been frozen since that that missile crisis. But again, South Korea is walking a very fine line here. It is also a close ally of the United States that perhaps could tap, you know, just how much it could lean toward China, because one thing China is still withholding is the lifting of that informal ban on Korean entertainment. South Korea has been pushing hard for that, but China has not yet really signaled that they will lift it yet. They give him a low there. China correspondent at the latest. When it comes to this, China and Japan, tensions there coming up. What are we talking ETFs with Moray as a global investment Hong Kong why they think investors well maybe take a look at when it comes to how Asia is faring here. E m certainly has been a hot, hot, hot spot to look at in the market here. And where you see these kind of flows will be for 2026. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back. It's the seventh calendar day. It's the third full trading day. So it's been a was a fantastic two days. As you can see. We're just pulling back a little bit after, of course, what was really a fantastic start to the year cost. You still, of course, all guns blazing, did catch a bit of a pause now, I think on Tuesday. But as you can see, 4500 now is what we were trading at very, very quickly. In case you missed that, there's a look at reports citing the PBOC and directly citing the PBOC itself, talking about how monetary policy in China will continue to remain generalizing here, a fairly supportive ten year yield. We've been talking about 1.9% 30 year yield now at 2.32 as the 30 year bond futures start trading on the lowest since 2024. Okay, so how do we make sense of price action and how it tells us where the best strategies will be for the year? Joining us here on set is Dennis FOK, chief ETF investment officer at MIRAE Asset Global Investment, Hong Kong. Good morning. Happy New Year. Good morning. Happy New Year. Nice to see you again. Yeah. Where would you last talk? I think it was 2024, right. I know one of the one of the forums. So a lot has changed since then. I think we've had 2025 where almost everything went up. I still continues to be, of course, front and center. Let me get started with sort of us asset dollar question How do investors need to be looking at potential performance of US assets this year? Yeah, I think it's a very good question. You know, for the last year into 2025, we are seeing fairly strong rally. You know, even though there are some volatility in terms of the point Mike had. However, you know, of course for the last two trading sessions, we are also seeing the continuous rally in the market. But the thing is that there is some interesting observation. If you remember last year, maybe at the beginning of January, there has been a lot of talk about the S & P 500 equal weighted index. What it means is that people were expecting that, you know, the valley would be bottoming last year. But the thing is that, you know, what we are observing from the data itself, he didn't realize in 2025, the S & P 500 equal weighted index underperformed 6%. But the thing is that for the last few trading action, we are seeing this actually reverse. What it means is that potentially the story about the air, you know, investment still will continue. What it means is that the index waiting for that individual seven still probably concentrated in the bull market is still would drive the market. But the thing is that what it means is that you know for other maybe always have the megacap and efficient seven are due to the adoption story potentially the market will be widening so that's much more healthier than maybe for the last five, maybe last five years. We are seeing that, you know, over 50% of the total return of the market index is driven by only a fairly concentrated bias kind of stock. Okay. So things could be running out in the US. We had a guess yesterday. Talk about us. Exceptions have been bruised. Do do you see further unwind of this whole U.S. exceptionalism sort of sort of trade or do you think that actually things could look a little bit better for the US this year? Yeah, that's a also another interesting question. The thing is that, you know, last year we have been seeing, you know, the weakening of the US dollar. This is primarily driven by the US Fed weaker cycle. We are now kind of in the beat cycle. What it means is that maybe some of the earliest cuts have been materialized already. The thing is that, you know, you based on the January, you know, FOMC business, I think a lot of our you know, officials are expecting potentially inflation. You know, us inflation has been motivating to 2%. What it means is that there could be some, you know, maybe 2 to 3 times of the weaker if there's no surprise in US inflation. What it means is that potentially there would be some you know we allocation from the you know, US exposure into the Asia market. That's what we are seeing, you know, fairly strong widely in the exchange index, you know, starting from last year. And that the thing is that, you know, for the last trading section, we are seeing the continuous valley and within Asia, as you were pointing out. In fact, let's put Jay in there because Chase, also an air play. Where do you think market leadership goes this year? Because it's been in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and then China? Yeah, I would say, you know, in terms of the extreme market, you know, for the last year, we are seen to, you know, fairly outperform most market, which are China and Korea. We are seeing, you know, China actually continued to perform for the last few trading section. I think one of the point that a lot of our in fact, investor may be a little bit surprised is that last year some of the technology heavy indices in China actually underperformed the market and also underperformed the dividend stock, for example, like some of the dividend bars can actually outperform more than 30% last year. But the. You have these, you know, index only, you know, increase by 1.5%. But the thing is that, you know, this year the outlook is a little bit different because I think similar to the U.S. story, a lot of AIG related investment is going to be materialized in China. And then when, of course, in China. Now, in the institutional space, people talk about, you know, the deep sea moment. But the thing is that, of course, the portending, you know, in us potentially will be China spreading, you know, outside of the US market. What it means is that potentially in China, other than, you know, the dividend stock, other than what market, you know, people also talk about, you know, China, Asia, you know, this year potentially will be a very positive year for that for that particular exposure. Yeah. I want to talk about your baby, which is, of course, three, 416 Hong Kong. This is because it's a very popular income strategy. Yeah. I mean 16% dividends last year. I mean is how important is income. Yeah. Strategies this year too. Yeah I would say you know if you'll take a look at the global, you know, investment who's think about you know during the U.S. weaker cycle you know maybe people cannot expect that the US rates can continue stay five if very high. Of course it would not jump to maybe you know, 1%. But the thing is that what it means is that people, you know, all over the world are looking for income harvesting. And the thing is that I just mentioned about that, you know, how strong performance for the China dividend stock. But the thing is that when the prices go up for the dividend install, it means that dividend you go down. Now, when I check the dividend yield of some of the popular, you know, China stocks is only at 16.4 6.5%. The thing is that, you know, in today's financial market, leveraging the option premium, leveraging part of the typical strategy to produce the alternative income could be quite interesting. That's why we are seeing, you know, very strong inflow for these type of product. They last year alone, we offset by one 2 billion just all inflow is one of the strongest inflow couple of core ETF in the world. So what it means is that you know the China market you know, continue to perform and you know the underlying asset, you know, for example, for these particular holidays, HCI potentially would be also very good performance. And the thing is that, you know, that's a fairly favorable environment for investing in copper coal, because the thing is that you would not expect very huge volatility, but at the same time at least you call and you know, portion of the option premium by, you know, benefiting from this kind of, you know, scenario. You give up though the upside as you know. Right. So this this strategy works for which type of investors, particularly if you expect global equities will continue to do well this year. Yeah, I would say, of course, no one has crystal ball how to actually predict the market. What we are trying to, you know, provide here is that, you know, think about, you know, if your portfolio for example you are holding some of the core as allocation. But the thing is that what if there are some volatility, You know, you know, reversion if you look at the global market like the VIX in U.S. is trading 50. But the thing is that the volatility can suddenly spike. So this type of strategy can pull y income especially is monthly distribution that at least during the types times of volatility, if your core asset allocation actually doesn't perform very well. But the thing is that at least you have to are more relatively stable of cash flow. Yeah. Oh, this one doesn't accumulate, right. It's distributed every month. Yeah. It's a monthly distribution. Okay. Sorry. That was just a point of the second point. What are some of the other sort of babies that you're watching out for, Right. Beyond just maybe the equity space? Maybe I'll talk about commodities that are firing alternative alternatives. I mean, what are some of the other things that you think could actually stand out for 2026? Yeah, yeah, that's a very interesting question. I would say, you know, of course, other than some alternative income, you know, people think about, you know, our fixed income, if you think about, you know, now is under the weights classical, you know, steel fixed income is very interesting even though you is no longer, you know, very high. But the thing is that people would take a look at, you know, for fixed income asset allocation, whether you want it bet on the nation versus the credit spread. My suggestion is that the credit spread. Now you say phobia low level. If you think about the US, AIG, you think or yeah yeah so that's why but the thing is that you know for the current weaker cycle we're in the mid-cycle I think for the duration less than five could be interesting because the thing is that the you know that the Fed would have more impact on the short end of Yukos. So that's why for the fixed income space, I think a lot of investors is looking at the, you know, intermediate or short term yield curve path to get alpha. All right, Denis, great to have you. Thanks for kicking off the year for us. Denis Faulk there, Chief Investment Officer, ETFs, ETF, Moray Asset, Global Investments here in Hong Kong. For more on what asset managers are really looking out for this year, you can check out this big take that's available on the terminal for subscribers. It's a good one. You got to click through a lot, but certainly it really highlights. All kind of I think it was like a few dozen other managers that they surveyed. They're super good on what the prospects are, the outlooks and of course, where the conviction lies, the function to use it. And I big take. We continue to track the headlines across it when it comes to Venezuela here this morning. And the latest is with President Trump not ruling out the use of military force to acquire Greenland. Now, the White House says he's discussing a range of options to acquire the Arctic island. But The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is downplaying military action, telling lawmakers the goal is to buy the island from Denmark. Bloomberg Lizzie Burton has more on why Trump has made Greenland a key foreign policy objective. Roughly three times the size of Texas. Greenland sits a strategically important location in the North Atlantic and Arctic. It has vast stores of critical minerals and fossil fuels coveted by the U.S. and its strategic rivals China and Russia. Buried beneath the ice sheets, climate change has made those resources more accessible than ever, and the thawing ice has opened up new trade routes between North America, Europe and Asia. Greenland is already home to the US's northernmost airbase, under a radar station that's used for detecting missiles and monitoring space. Gaining control over Greenland could give the US Government new opportunities to expand its military presence in the Arctic, as well as access to critical materials to build the economy of the future without relying on the likes of Beijing. You know, And on that on that very story, there's one specific stock. It's coming up on your screens. Energy transition minerals. It's listed in Oz. It has it's a miner there, but it has a to the point that Leslie was just making there on the many resources available. It has a rare earths project. It was up as much as 40% at one point has clearly come down ever so slightly. So we'll watch it closely. Of course, the stock is gaining the most in a couple of months up also gaining on the back of and this is still a a material story that's not pun intended. They're looking at nickel producers. So the first one is a big one, of course, listed here in in Hong Kong. Some of the others are listed across Asia. You have, of course, those in Indonesia, which has just come online, substantial gains after substantial gains in nickel prices in London. And of course, the gains we're seeing there specifically are also and pulling back a little bit on the London contract here in Shanghai. That's playing a bit of catch up to Korea. Automakers also in focus on the motor. And of course, some of its affiliates are also surging here today. And after these media reports of an executive chairs meeting with a video, CEO, Jensen Huang at CES. So the two I wonder if they had beer and chicken again. But yeah, ongoing excitement over robotics business. China export controls on Japan also seem to be supporting the auto sector in Korea. Here I could do with a pint of water. To be more specific. I'm a bit thirsty even though it's a bit cold out. I could do with some fried chicken though. Any day, any day, any time of the day. Any time of the day. Hyundai, by the way, speaking of what Yvonne just mentioned. Right. So it it it unveiled its humanoid robot. That was yesterday. So building on gains even further there, a quick glance at benchmarks going into the first 60 minutes of the cash market session. There you go. And this is Walmart. 11:29 a.m. in Tokyo. Japanese markets are heading to a lunch break. And yeah, we talked about the stock rally, also having a break as well here today on the back of these escalating tensions between China and Japan. That's weighed on the Japanese markets here today. Nikkei and topics are both lower by about 4/10 of 1%. The yen's around one 56.57 levels here this morning. So certainly that is one to watch. But, yeah, we're tracking, of course, I mean, the first four trading days have been quite strong, robust today it's just a little bit of an easing of that. Yeah, I mean, it can't continue at that rate. Otherwise it's what we said. What was it bad from the vertical horizon. Remember that. Oh yeah. There we go. Right. That would have been the look of the chart. But yeah, it's we'll get into of course the comeback, the resurgence of Asia tech. Right. So if you thought the change of the calendar meant a change of market leadership so far apart from today, that's not that's not the case. Right. Asia dashboard coming online. Yeah. Okay, let's have a look at that. Yeah. My brain's not funk. It's just calling cold. It's cold. Are you having some brain freeze? Yeah, it's really, really. It's really cold in here. I might not be able to continue getting cold degrees, but my apple, my. My phone. The weather app says it feels like two degrees colder. So, yeah, it's not the type of weather if you're nursing a heartbreak. No. Although if you have if you if you're if you if you do have though, if you're looking to flaunt a fleece ski jacket, this is probably the time to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's justified. I spotted at least five was Canadian Canada Goose. Canada Goose. Canadian goose. Sorry, duck. I get the jackets early this morning and we come into work very, very early. Right. So that just underscores the square meter per capita, two square meter of sightings there. Anyway, I digress. World leading hot market is in Korea. Have a look at it cost me right we're at 4500. We were below 2500 just last April and we're at 92% from that level. Right. So we're a good one or two days from effectively doubling over, what, just nine months? Yeah. And you talk about leadership. Obviously, Korea stands out in the region. What you break it down, I mean, it has been the likes of Samsung. Right. And in terms of, you know, the stock outperformance that we saw, it's the first time in three years basically where Samsung has actually beat us. Hynix, I would say the early parts of this of this year, I should say last year they were still there, but gap there. But certainly it's at a $350 billion in market value. And this whole narrative that, you know, there's a catch up story underway that maybe a Samsung is back. When you talk about the progress of AI, you talk about these huge price hikes for memory chips, Samsung stands to face these tailwinds as well. So analysts are expecting in terms of earnings are going to more than double this year to a record high and the market cap is not even close. I think we're only just I mean, less than half of that of TSMC. So maybe there is still further to catch up. Yeah, there is some upside there. Although on the TSMC note also coming in this morning was I think Jp morgan upped their price target on TSMC Samsung while the news got quite fittingly so just coming through right now Morgan Stanley has increased their six month price target on the clock speed to as to as high as 4800. This one just crossing just crossing the Bloomberg terminal. Right. So just fittingly, of course, as we as we discuss this, I think Macquarie raised it to 22,000 240,001, the price target there. So yeah, so ways to go, A ways to go. But yes, I'm sensitive. Yes, I think yeah. I mean the products of course at Las Vegas or generate some fresh buzz as well. We spoke exclusively with the company president and Chief marketing officer Jin Lee about their outlook amid continued optimism surrounding high. So this year our exhibition is themed. Your companion to AA Living. All right. So, you know, when others are calling this a home, we really wanted to go a step up and call this a living. Because with the breadth of products that we have, you know, we are with you in a very unique way and continuously throughout the day. So by understanding your needs, your behavior, whether it's from your mobile phones or TVs and fridges and washing machines and whatnot right there, we can really personalize the whole experience. It's a new purchases by new customers. Are you trying to increase the lifetime value of your existing customers? It's a little bit of both. I mean, you know, if you ask anyone whether A.I. is important for your products now and for the future, I think you're going to get a very consistent answer that it is important, right? But I think right now you need to futureproof your product more so than ever because of the speed at which A.I. is developing. You know, I've been in the industry long enough to see how technology has transformed our lives. You know, when we went from analog to digital to the Internet to the mobile Internet and so forth, you know, based on what I have witnessed over the years, I think the speed at which we're seeing AI is advancing is nothing like I've seen in the past. Right. Because the not only the technology itself is evolving fast, but adoption rate is also moving at a very, very fast pace. So the evolution of the technology itself, of course, IBM for chips will be crucial. And we have heard from Samsung CEO John Young on talking about how customers think Samsung is back because of this new product. How much does that improve the outlook for every other part of Samsung's business that you oversee appliances, TVs, smartphones, because that was such a dark cloud hanging over Samsung? Well, I think in 2026, yeah, there's going to be issues around semiconductor supplies and it's going to affect everyone, not just Samsung, I think is industry wide reality that we're going to see some supply issues with semiconductors. So that will certainly have an impact on all the connected devices that we make with the memories and so forth. But I think we're in a better place than most of other constituents in the industry just because of the scale of the business that we run on a global basis. What will the strategy be if you need to implement those price hikes? Well, I think and again, this is going to affect us the same way right now when when memory prices go up, it's going to have an impact on the price of products. So I don't think we're immune to those those issues. When are we going to see that transport prices are going up even as we speak? So, you know, obviously, we don't want to convey that burden to the consumers, but we're going to be at a point where we have to actually consider repricing our products. And you were saying that this affects everyone in the industry. What's your competitive edge now, for example, in segments like televisions? Because I know that, for example, Samsung's frame has been very popular, right? You have artwork in the home as TVs. You've seen a wave of clones from other TV makers. This year you have LG, for example. How do you stay ahead? Well, you know, competition is nothing new to Samsung right now. We've been the number one TV maker for 20 years running. So, yeah, we've had various types of competition over the years. Well, you know, this time around, you know, we're seeing a lot of cheap TVs coming to the market, Right. You know, a 75 inch costs 75 inch TV costs far less than what it used to cost. Right. But I think we look at the competition in a slightly different way. You know, I think you just mentioned our frame TV, right? It's not just about watching TV. Right. It brings another angle to your viewing experience at home. Right. You get to enjoy the artwork. Right. In addition to watching Netflix and Amazon and whatnot, I think that's a really another angle that we've been pursuing. Well, this time around, as our exhibition indicates, you know your companion to AA living. Right. So we're really trying to elevate our competitive landscape from competing in TV space, competing in mobile or home appliances. You know, the combined experience of, you know, Samsung portfolio products. Right. Really gives you a differentiated experience versus something that is offered by another competitor as a single item or a single category of products. So as we're seeing now, these price hikes come through and not only in Samsung, but also, of course, among other device makers. What's your demand outlook for the year, especially given that companies like Samsung as well have suffered from tariffs last year? I'm a member of our Digital experience division where we make end products like mobile phones, TVs and home appliances. You know, these are industries that are expecting to see a modest growth. So but I think just looking at our outlook of the business, I think we're going to be able to outpace the market. How will they compared to last year, especially given that is a challenging base? You saw a lot of people preempting purchases because of the tariffs. I think we're going to be doing okay. Yeah, I think we're we're more optimistic about the outlook of 2026 than what we have experienced last year at the devices and sectors. Yes. In which sectors? Mobile phones. I mean, I think with the emergence of I think people are looking at upgrading their products and be able to leverage the new technologies that are embedded into our products. When it comes to the price hikes, how difficult is it for you to market it to customers? I can't say it will not have an impact, but, you know, obviously we're trying not to pass that burden to the customers as much as we can. And that was the Samsung president and chief marketing officer, John Lee, speaking with Sherry at CBS. We're just getting some breaking lines here when it comes to our here from China. So regulators are now talking about banning platforms from forcing merchants to join promotions. So this is, of course, affecting some of these online platforms with these management measures here. They were already following I have to mind you there before this news, but certainly does lead to a bit more questions about where these price wars lie, the fact that the regulators are once again starting off the year talking about the need to stop these sort of discounts here and to really put an end to these price wars or at least slow it down. Yeah, they're removing the incentives that lead to lower prices right now. Separately, and this is a separate release that's also around specific rules that China is now issuing management. China has issued management measures for live streaming e commerce. It's now banned live streamers from making. Well, this is almost stating what's necessary, really. China's ban is famous for making false advertising claims. There's a full statement in Mandarin. We'll get into it once we have more details, Steve. But yes, these are two separate things. And I imagine these are the two things we'll be talking more of over the coming over the coming days. Markets are reacting slightly, but as you point out, we were already down ahead of the breaking news in the last few minutes or so. All of those beginning of four or five trading sessions of 2026 have been about there's optimism around tech. Right. And our Bloomberg intelligence team thinks 2026 will cement Asia's tech ascendancy with the likes of China and Japan, consolidating their positions as key global players. Let's bring in our big thematic strategist, Shirley Wong. She joins us now. So in terms of themes, what are you watching over this year? Yeah, thank you for having me. It certainly is going to be an exciting year this year. And basically the conversation is still going to be around, A.I., still going to dominate conversations. But we think that that conversation has shifted somewhat into infrastructure. And, you know, talking about things like data centers, power grids and so forth. So we think that investors are taking a more picks and shovels approach, looking at some of the tools and services that provides you the AI industry. Yeah, part of the thesis here is also the nuance within AI, right? So I wonder if you could be more specific along the different themes that investors should be paying attention to because people look at A.I. and it ties into one basket and it's, you know, you find alpha and what's not too. What's, you know, what's gone unnoticed. Yeah. I like to think of it as two groups, you know, those that are companies that are from the source of the AI industry, you know, along the value chain of the API chain. You know, you see those that actually provide the energy, the power, the infrastructure. So that's one set of groups are there. And then the other group would be the downstream players, the ones other end users of API. So within the infrastructure we have a newly launched theme is called a computer infrastructure theme, and that really tracks a basket of companies that are involved in the physical structure, like the construction of the data centers and and that could range from everything from like cooling systems around the data center to even the physical security of the data center. And then we also have the great tech theme, and that one has done quite well last year, you know, has outperformed the utilities benchmark index. And so the power of great tech theme is basically companies that are involved in sort of like the the upkeep and the maintenance and the modernization, the upgrade of the power grid. And, you know, for the Asian shares for these power grid companies, they have actually performed over 30% in the last year or so. Yeah, a lot of that is is in China. As you as you mentioned, they might actually steal the spotlight in terms of let's talk about 91st market. Are there themes that are not AI related that you think could still be good opportunities this year? Yeah, I mean, everything's around AI, but if you have to look at some of these companies out there, blockchain is one of them that has been overshadowed by A.I. technology and blockchain companies are really, you know, like the foundation for not only cryptocurrency trading, despite some of the volatility that we've seen there with Bitcoin, but also the foundation for tokenization trends. You know, so these are companies that are looking to place some of their financial assets on chain, and it also has industrial uses as well. You know, like blockchain is also a part of the smart contracts that we've seen in some of these, you know, companies along the supply chain. And logistics. And also, you know, there's a lot of noise last year about geopolitics, about global trade tensions. So I like to call these groups of companies, strategic tech companies. And these are companies that are critical to a nation's, you know, self-sufficiency along the supply chain and also to their economy. And so these strategic tech companies would include things like our fantastic quantum computing space technology, as well as the rare earth elements in transition metals theme is also quite important as well. Yeah, So our our viewers and clients are probably wondering what those names are. You can check that out for our clients by go of course on on your Bloomberg terminals. That was Shirley Wang, our thematic strategist of course out of Bloomberg Intelligence. So we'll have more from you. Speaking of the broader tech conversation from CBS in the next hour, Daniel Newman will be joining us at those times on your screens. If you're watching out of Hong Kong, it's 1030 in the evening. If you're joining us out of the out of New York this is morning. Copper pricing is actually going up in the cloud. All of the all of the hoppers are consumed in cloud and and now pricing, spot pricing is starting to go up. And so that tells you about the the demand that's being generated all over the world. So H2O, I think is going to contribute also to and I think all told, all told, I, I think we should have a very good year. Yeah. The man that moves the markets with just a just a few comments. In fact, when you look at memory. Right. And I think what he also said there was storage is a completely unserved market today. And you had a massive move up in the likes of SanDisk at 28%, I believe, in the U.S. I think we're seeing that here as well in the Asia Pacific. Memory chips coming up on your screens already very shortly. So there we go. Yeah. Remember this memory on the way up. The other one is we just talked in case you're joining us right now right earlier segment with would surely want we discussed the thematics around air infrastructure and cooling stocks right a lot of money got into that specific subtheme and Jensen Huang effectively poured cold water on that and said when you look at what Rubin is able to do, it's able to cool the racks using water at temperature that does not require a water chiller. There we go. So just the frontier of that technology sort of makes you re retest your thesis around some of the key themes here. Yeah. I'm still trying to get around that crack leather that he the jacket that he's wearing as well. But yes, obviously it's not just about the connection that I won't be able to see. He has it's always going to be about the products and the gadgets and like. And check out this one. I think this is great. This Chinese company, Robo Rock, has unveiled, get this, a robot vacuum cleaner with two legs that can climb stairs in people's homes. Obviously, you know, if all we need is a duplex nowadays. Yeah, but yes, it's so cute. I should go upstairs. It's got 3D spatial information, several motion sensors and can raise and lower its legs independently So I can go up and down the stairs. Even down, of course, little steep hills as well, and navigate uneven services. So cool stuff. Obviously, we all would love one of these at home. But again, there's not an article. So right to your point, we there's probably not a very big market for this space anywhere these days or levels really as well. But it can't clean on the steps, though. No, no, no. So I was I think the ones that have been coming in the past cannot I don't know if this one can or cannot. Okay. But, you know, there's still a lot of questions about this this sort of technology. Right. Because there are some challenges. Their high prices, the one they launched last year was, I think north of 20 $500 us. So the price tag is certainly one thing. The one last year they launch was completely different. They were talking about how I can pick up socks on the floor. Yeah, which I would love to have because I have a husband that does this a lot at home. Pick up the socks or just leave us off. Leave the out. Okay. But yes, so, but they said that it was only specific on certain items. And then I know a lot of people question what if it falls right. Can it kind of pick yourself up? You know, they they you know, we don't really know if they can. It can turn to look at that. So in order for it to actually be mainstream, I think it's still got to deal with some of these obstacles as well. Yeah. I wonder if you can circle back to that. Yeah. That scene of climbing, climbing the stairs, how much does it go for in the previous version was quite, quite pricey. More than $2,000. Oh yeah, Yeah. Here we go. So, you know what this reminds me of? What? I have a few friends that after they've had a few, this is how they go off. This is. This is probably how they look. This is probably not clean. The floor is either. Maybe they are or their clothes. Yeah, yeah. But yes, they're making also a role. I mean, robots are huge at CES this year and I think they made a whole section just for for robots. Right. So you got to check it out. I think there's one that also sorts and folds laundry. I need that as well. Anyways, we'll be live in Seattle all week. Yes. And Las Vegas. And tomorrow we're hearing from Hitachi as well as Hyundai Motor as they have, of course, a new humanoid robot designed for work in working in car factories. Right up. Just some news in the last few minutes or so around platform companies. But it's it's it's it's an old theme. But I think we have more details now on how this might work in terms of intense competition will certainly have more on this in the coming days, weeks and months. It will be a very big feature of shows, I would imagine, in 2026. Apart from this, we're looking at the Hang Seng index. We're about 90 minutes into the catch market session there. And I think the story really has not been about the Hong Kong markets so far, although separately, you know, the listing market has still continued to fire on all cylinders. It's strong January already. Yeah, I think it's the best. We're set for the best January. Yeah. Ever. Right. And we're what, two, seven days here? And we have just to say we have two big listings this week that we're looking at two right. The Thursday and Friday anyway. Apart from that geopolitics rearing its ugly head, showing up on the Asian benchmark. How about the Asia-Pacific benchmark being dragged down by Japan? That's it for me. That's it from us here on the China show. Perfect time for a stumble because we're done for the day. We'll see you all tomorrow.

Bloomberg's Mike McGlone joins to discuss with Paul Sweeney and Scarlet Fu. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nMacro is crude oil prices are going down. It's a bear market. It's what the Trump administration wants and the curious partisan methods he's using that's just entertaining to watch. And everything I see is he's going to get what he wants to get crude oil prices lower. So what I think the good news is to people who like to be bullish crude oil, which typically doesn't go up and stay up, is I think we're getting towards the lower end of a narrow low price cure stage, which means maybe around $42 a barrel if history is an example. But anything up and any bonds now 65 would hold resistance. The bottom line is, as our colleague, our blast has pointed out, the whole America is from North America down to South America, become a price maker in crude oil and commodities. And taking that away from that used to be a price taker, which is that's where that trend is at the moment. Okay. So we have control over our destiny. We set the price as opposed to receive it and have to contend with it. Yeah. The president says Venezuela will send anywhere from 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, worth about $2.8 billion at current market prices. Is 50 million barrels a lot? It sounds like a lot. Well, it's not really a lot. Let's put that in context. The US and Canada combined export have a net surplus of about 8 million barrels a day, and that's compared to a deficit of around 2 million barrels just ten years ago. So it's the trend that's happening. A lot of those barrels that we're going to China will not be going to China in more. And that's the key thing is, is that more geopolitical now with the Trump administration asking Venezuela, push away from China and Russia and Iran. But the bottom line is crude oil in the bottom is heading lower, but such as crude oil, the weakest commodity so far. One a week is coming so far. This is natural gas. I'll get in. I'll give you a headline In about a month, you're going to be able to say natural gas. A front contract is around $2 per mm. BTU that April contract is 2.8. Just a month ago it was four. As we cycle down in natural gas, that's the whole area that all the energy complex is heading that way. We're on the bottom. This is the key question. Yeah, I'm just pulling up my GLC oh page Global Commodities and it breaks it down between energy, metals, agriculture. It's a great, great screen. Henry Hub Natural gas that's been at for north of $4 for like a long time. It's $3.50 right now. So it's happening right, Right. And that's the winter contract. That's a front contract. But the contracts, Paul, that's anticipating those tulips coming up in New York, that's those the ones are going to get hammered. So just when you reported in hopefully about two months from now, Mr. Trump will be delighted to hear you're going to be able to say to handle on natural gas versus just a month ago for that front contract, it was closer to five. But that's a key thing, is natural gas. Had we had a colder than normal winter last year, increase that demand. But now we're realizing the trend in global warming is probably consistent.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:38:31 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T17:45:59.208445"}

Is that true? What are you guys up to? Well, I would say that we've always been known as a disciplined investor. We talk about purchase price matters. We talk about alignment with our investors. And I think that with that statement is it's really about the gauntlet for approving investments that Apollo has gotten higher and higher over the last year or so. As we see an environment that down the fairway, I'll use a golf analogy down the fairway, you've got a lot of great things going on, you know, massive CapEx cycle, good economic growth, consumer and solid shape, you know, a variety of great attributes. That being said, the rough weather, there's lots of challenges between geopolitics, between the concern about inflation, between the concern about the return of invested capital. And I, there's a variety of left tail items that have certainly grown in stature. You know, as I as I listen to some of the macro commentary here, I think there's a great deal of humility about the macro view of how the predictions as I meant, I've said here many times, we said here after SVB, we all thought massive capital slowdown in spending and credit crisis. The US economy really was massively resilient. You guys talked earlier about what's going on with that with the deficit. I think it's a little bit it's the economy, stupid, the US economy. People just don't want to short the the great momentum of what's going on. And we have a we have an administration that's very politically savvy about populist topics. He's been very responsive. But I again, I this goes back to us, back to the question you had. We're putting money to work. This week was a busy week. We announced 6 billion of deals of transactions, all great companies. Again, we're leaning into larger companies that are part of the global industrial Renaissance one. With that, Brad Jacobs, a 4035 year winner in the building products space, the second one with Russell Investments, really simplifying their capital structure. And then the last transaction was very interesting, actually, it was for Valor X, it was really a sale leaseback on a massive amount, 5 billion of Nvidia chips. So all three really interesting transactions, but really well structured downside risk. And I think that's our view right now. We want we want to be investing capital, but you got to acknowledge you can wake up on a on a Saturday morning and see us with, you know, activities around the globe that really enhances the the tail risk of geopolitics. You can get a stroke of the pen announcement yesterday with regard to housing. And so I think you have to be very, very careful about how you invest long term at scale. To extend the analogy, though, to your point, the fairway is getting narrower, the rough is getting deeper. In the last few years, it's not been that way. Allocating risk and you'll perform. You'll do well within a tougher environment. The analogy for golf, for those who play a lot of golf is we're at the US Open. The US Open is known for tight fairways and really punitive rough, and if you keep in the fairway, you're going to be a great victor and you're going to have great success. I think there's going to be, as last year will remind us, you can have some bumps in the road during the course of the year that definitely change the trajectory on liquidity and momentum and risk appetite. So but I think the long term trend is quite positive. But I do think you have to be very measured about how you execute your business model.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:19:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T13:48:03.419745"}

So let's start there. Where are you for this year? Is your thought? What are you looking for? Yes. So I'm unsurprisingly the lowest that I'm looking for. About a point and a half of cuts. A lot of that is driven by my view of inflation. I gave a speech about this and, you know, about a month ago in December at Columbia University. My view is that almost all of the excess inflation over target is due to quirks of how we calculate inflation. So as you have talked about with many of your guests many times before, shelter inflation really, really lags a lot. And because average tenant rents have caught up to new tenant rents, because market rents have been running at a 1% rate for a couple of years now, I think it's appropriate to sort of think about underlying inflation as as abstracting from that a little bit. You know, the shelter inflation is indicative of a supply demand imbalance for 2022, 2023, not 2027. We need to be making policy for 2027 because policy lags. And other side of it is the portfolio management fees that I'm sure you've talked about again with many your guests many times. Stock market went up mechanically. Inflation was higher despite many of your other guests, I'm sure no doubt telling you about fee compression in the asset management industry for decades seems track from those two things.

He's on this week's episode of The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations. This interview was recorded June 26 at the 92nd Street Y in New York.  (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nThis is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor the highest calling of mankind. I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. Oh, I watch your interviews because I know how to do something. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said. 250. I said, Fine. I didn't negotiate with him. I didn't know due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world. Is that right? More than 50 years ago, a young Harvard Business School graduate, Ray Dalio, started a hedge fund. BRIDGEWATER That fund became the largest hedge fund in the world and one of the most successful in the world. Over this period of time. He's writing a number of books, and his most recent book talks about his concern about debt in the United States and around the world. I had a chance to sit down with Ray Dalio to talk about his views about investing. In recent months, one of the most common things talked about is something called tariffs. What is your view on tariffs as a good economically bad economic? Is going to solve our budget problem because I think in the big beautiful bill, a lot of money that's coming in comes in from tariffs and that helps reduce the deficit a bit. Tariffs. Tariffs are not bad. Throughout history, tariffs were the main source of government revenue and so on. And any form of taxes has its cost. So capital gains taxes are bad and so on. Different things have their costs. I think the question is how well executed? How big are they? How disruptive are they in terms of the process? They can bring a significant. There's something to be said for them in that they bring in a significant amount of revenue. That means that there is less that needed elsewhere. And we're now in a different world. We're in a world where the world is. Almost at war self-sufficiency. We have to build self-sufficiency. We cannot continue to borrow or depend on imports for that. And so there's a manufacturing. How do you create manufacturing in the United States? And so there's some merit to all of those arguments. The question is whether that is done really well and so on for the whole world. Tariffs, of course, are not the ideal you would like to have if you're dealing what's best for the whole world. You would like to have the least efficient inefficiency. You'd say wherever they produce it the best and we have it go around. But we're in a world now that we have to be realistic in terms of we cannot be dependent on importing a lot of things, and nor can the world be dependent on the value of the bonds and the debt that we're acquiring in order to pay for those things. Well, the big, beautiful bill that's now being talked about, would that solve our problem to mitigate it or what it will do? It's not going to solve our problem. Okay. So if that's not going to solve our problem, how are we going to solve this problem? We're going to do it the way that we always do it. And it's always done when countries essentially go broke. What they do is they through a combination of devaluing the currency. Printing of money. There's an imbalance. The print money devalue the currency and create an artificially low interest rate so that the person who's holding the bonds is receiving an artificially low interest rate. That's the way Japan has done it with their local. And that's the way we will do it. So in other words, my grandchildren and great grandchildren not yet born, are going to be paying off this debt in devalued dollars, more or less going to happen faster than that. Faster than that. Oh, okay. I think they'll probably be on that. What about cutting interest rates? Why doesn't the chairman of the Fed say, well, cutting interest rates will save us money? We're spending $1,000,000,000,000 now on interest for our own debt. Why don't we just lower the interest rate? Why don't we just do that? There is the real interest rate and one man's debts or another man's assets. And so if I lower the interest rate, I will reduce my desire to hold that bond. And in my opinion, if you do that too much, you will lose the demand for that those bonds. You unlike if you do create something closer to the 4% cut in the expenditures, 4% increase in the tax revenue, improve the balance, then you'll have a benefit. If you try to force interest rates down, you are hurting those who are holding the bonds and you will lose the demand for the bonds. And you can create that spiral. Before we finish this discussion, I want you to just wrapped it up for a moment and say, look, you've scared me a bit, but I need to make money. I'm an investor. What should I do to take advantage of what you just described and scared me? Should I go buy gold or should I go buy dollars? Buy euros? What should I do? Look at the value of your portfolio in inflation adjusted terms, not in nominal terms. Okay. And the safest investment that you can get right now is an inflation indexed bond. Because what you'll get is it'll be indexed and you'll get a bit over 2% real return above inflation and whatever happens. So you start with what is a safe investment. The next thing I think you have to do is, is diversify your portfolio. We talked about the powers of diversification, so why don't want to get anybody into one bit because I'm going to be wrong. But do consider that gold is a form of money and gold is that is central banks are acquiring gold now as a diversifier. And so in your it also is negatively correlated with most of the things that you have done in a time of great stress. And what you'll find is that the gold will do well and when the assets don't. The world used to have gold as money. That was the way. And so the world would look at things differently. They would look at the prices of things in gold terms. Now, because we have fiat money and we've become used to it. We look at the prices of things in money terms and we look at gold that way. I think if you started to say it's money, it's a source of money, and you have that, that's part of the diversify. So it would diversify your portfolio. It's a prudent thing to have somewhere between ten or 15% of your portfolio in gold. For thousands of years, people have liked gold and people still seem to like gold. Price of gold are going up. Why are people so interested in owning gold in a time like this? Since 1750? 80% of the world's money have disappeared and all of those that existed have been greatly devalued. That's one of the reasons that gold is a store hold of wealth and has been for a long time. And there's a saying that gold is the only asset that you can have that's not somebody else's liability. And what they mean by that is that you don't have to receive money from somebody else in the world that we're now in and we're seeing it internationally. There is a worry about sanctions. There's a worry about taking gold. Those holders, central banks around the world are concerned about the possibility that, let's say, what happened to Russia could happen to them and so on. So there's a diversification of that, and it creates a dynamic in and of itself, because what happens is if they are switching and they are switching to gold away from bonds and so on, then that has the effect of not only making our supply demand balance that we're talking about, about the new deficit. It means that you can have the selling of gold, which makes that supply demand balance worse. Now, it used to be the case that the US dollar was backed by gold, and the US government said, If you don't like these pieces of paper, we'll give you gold. And ultimately we ended that. We're never going to go back to that, presumably, right? Probably. Presumably. That's right. But not if you watch these gold say these cycles because you have the devaluation, then people feel they don't have confidence in the fiat system over a period of time and through history. They at that point, the way it works is you print all this money, then you pray the debt with the cheap money and that, but nobody wants to hold it. So then they go back and link it again. It is conceivable that you can see a re linking of gold to money, but that's way in the future. Since the beginning of this year, the dollar against the basket of currencies is down about 10% and many people are worried that that might continue that way be devalued. Some people say it's not a bad thing because we can sell things more cheaply overseas and increase our exports. But if people are worried about the dollar going down in value, what would you suggest they do? Buy other currencies or go buy things that are not dollar denominated? I think their concern would be some version very similar to the seventies you just talked about. I remember I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on August 15th, 1971, and that is when Richard Nixon got on the television and he said in his polite way, this was a wonderful move. But the money that you thought you had, the gold was money. And what at the time people thought were real, the money that we're used to, they would say, are like checks in the checkbook. They said, you're not going to get your money. You can keep the checks at that point. Then we began the seventies, and the seventies was a period in which there was both stagflation. The thing that we have to worry about is a stagflation area environment because all the currencies went down. So when you were looking at diversification, the problems that we're talking about are not just American problems. We have a significant problem. But if their European problems, their Japanese problems, there's Chinese problems. No, there's we've lived on promises to be able to take that debt asset and convert it into money. And now there's not enough money to go around. So I would say that when you ask the question, would I devalue in relationship to other currencies? Probably. But the other currencies won't want much of an appreciation. And so that's why I'm saying that something like gold will breed the better performing currency. Some people worry about this and can tell us whether this is realistic or not. In 1985 there was something called the Plaza Accords where the United States government agreed with other governments that we were going to devalue the dollar illegally officially, and it was done in secret. Nobody knew it was coming. Is that a possibility that the government of United States could again agree with other governments? We're going to devalue the dollar further. You think that's unlikely these days? No, I think it's it's possible that. Yes, it's so interesting in history. When you look at what happens when governments are in certain positions all through history, they do the same things. Okay. And that means that a move like that or even there could be foreign exchange controls, there can be different ways that that that that happens. Now, my perception is that people in Washington always say, well, if the situation was that bad, the bond market would collapse. And then the bond market people say, well, the situation that bad Congress wouldn't do this. And they both kind of blame each other for not doing anything. Why hasn't the bond market collapsed ever? The fact that we have all this debt over all these years, you know, like they say, I've experienced this many times. I did this analysis in 27 and eight. I went to Congress and everybody said they asked me the same question. But we had the problem. Same thing happened in Europe. So there's a supply demand. There's a saying, you know, that everything goes slowly until it happens all at once. When the problem happens, you know, these things happen like that. How long did it take you to write this book? This is how many books have been written. Four four. Okay. And how long does it take to write a book like this? This is research that I've done over a long period of time. So putting it together and getting it out, you know, I would say a part time basis, maybe over a year. So you built the biggest hedge fund in the world. What's the relative pleasure of building of the biggest hedge fund in the world versus writing a book that's a bestseller? As you would know, probably it's a stage in life thing. You know, there's a stage in life where, you know, you're competing, you build something, and then there's a stage in life where you're passing things along, you know? So at this stage in life, you and your way, me and my way, it's a great, great joy to be able to pass along what I've learned. So I'm loving it. This book is designed to make people feel good or to scare people. Neither it. I wanted to convey the mechanics, the cause effect, relationships so that people can understand what's going on and then navigating it. I think it's a book that will make people worry. But I have a principle, which is if you worry, you don't have to worry. And if you don't worry, you need to worry because if you worry about something, then maybe you'll prevent what you're worrying about. When did you decide to become a writer as opposed to just an investor? I mean, a lot of great hedge fund investors just keep sitting in front of screens and so forth. When did you say, I want to do more than sitting in front of screens? Was that couple of years before you decided to exit Bridgewater? No, it was maybe 35, 40 years ago. What I learned was that if I was whenever I was making decisions, if I would pause and reflect and write down the criteria that I would use to make that decision, it would make me think more deeply about it. And then I learned that I could put those into code and then back test them so I would know how my decision making would work. And so right from then 35 years ago, that's how really I built Bridgewater was. What are the criteria? Test the criteria over a period of time and then form a game plan. So I'd say 35 years ago, I've written down I call these things principles, I've written down probably, you know, I don't know a thousand of them or something. For those who haven't followed the hedge fund world. You you're from Long Island. You went to Long Island University. You would say you were not a superstar in high school. On the contrary. But you did very well at Long Island University. And eventually you got in the Harvard Business School and you started your career. And your career almost went south when you punched your boss in the mouth, right? No, that was my my opportunities began. I got fired. What? I got fired. Then I sort of got fired. You started your own firm and you borrowed some money at some point from your father because the firm hadn't done that well. And what? Did you ever think that maybe you weren't going to make it and at the point that you were so young? Let me tell you about that incident, because it was one of the worst cases and one of the best cases for me. So this is 1980, 81. And I had calculated that the United States lent more money to countries that are never going to be able to pay back and that there would be a big debt crisis. And then and that happened. Volcker type money, 1982. Mexico defaults on its debt. And I got a lot of attention because I anticipated this and I thought I was right and I couldn't have been more wrong. I thought we were going to have a big economic crisis because of this. And what happened instead was the stock market went up, the ease monetary policy and I a terrible mistake and it cost me money. I was so broke that I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad in order to pay for family bills. And this was painful. And that changed my approach to everything. Two ways. Two ways. First, it made me think, How do I know I'm right? It gave me the humility I needed to balance with my audacity. And it let me understand how do I play this game going forward? And I understood the power of diversification and how diversification could reduce risk by up to 80% without reducing returns. And that was then the bottom of Bridgewater. And then from then on, it was straight because of the lesson I learned writing down these things in these experiencing and making the most out of mistakes as learning experiences has been learned. Investor You always have ups and downs. Nobody does everything perfectly, not even Warren Buffett Right. But you know what? What changed that from that point the returns were in my. 30 some odd years since of doing that. Since that point, it was, I think about 11.8% return with no year down significantly other than 2000 to 2020 during COVID and that was down 13%. But the other years were down like 2% because I learned the power of diversification. You know, one of the things about diversification is that you can reduce the returns, the risks, without reducing the term. My mantra is 15 good, uncorrelated return streams because you if you if they engineered to have about the same expected return and you have that kind of diversification, you will lower the risk by about 80%, which raises the return to risk ratio by a factor of five. So that's the power of of of the game play. And that's what helped me make your work and your passion the same thing. And don't forget about the money part. In other words, I didn't work for money, but I had a passion. I fell in love with the game of investing you. What about yourself? Why don't you go into government? What have you thought about? You're being secretary, Treasury. Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Run for the Senate or something and solve those problems while you're in government. Have you ever thought of that? Scares the daylights out of you. Let me say I have the greatest appreciation and respect for those who go into public service and serve in this kind of an environment. And I think there's a question of whether with the population, it's not just a leadership question, it's a can you lead question. You can bring capable people into that job. But we're in we're in a situation where everybody's fighting over every decision all the time. And and we'll tear everybody down if there. So it's a very difficult situation. Now somebody is watching. They say, I want to be the next Ray Dalio, who builds a gigantic hedge fund, does well financially, well respected by people, writes bestselling books. What's the secret to that? What do you do? Make your work and your passion the same thing. And don't forget about the money part. In other words, I didn't work for money, but I had a passion. I fell in love with the game of investing. And I think you have to make your work in your passion the same thing. But you do have to pay attention to the money part, because if you're not earning an adequate amount of money, then that's a problem. So what? And I don't think the best life is for those who make the most amount of money. And there's a very low correlation between the level of happiness or well-being past the basic level of income, the highest. Really? You're just telling me that now? Wow. Here's what we know so far. Which has the highest level of happiness and well-being generally is a sense of community. Do you have a sense of community? Your friends in that community? But anyway, I would say don't overexaggerate the power of money. You need to have enough and you have to pursue your passion and and, you know, have enough money. And it's if it's if it's never work, if you're pursuing your passion, what do you think is the best investment vehicle for a middle class American that is risk adverse and an inflation index bond, which is index fund, tips Treasury Inflation-protected securities because it will guarantee you a real return. And I don't think that you should be speculating in the markets because there's a zero sum game and you'll probably be the loser. So as we get ready to celebrate next year, the 250th anniversary of this country. Are you optimistic about our future or is the debt problem so concerning to you? You're not optimistic about our future? I think it's a time horizon. We're going to go. I think I think we can deal with this. I think it comes down to how we are with each other. But we will go through this and we will get to the other side. Okay. And when you go meet with members of Congress or other people in government and you talk about these serious issues of debt and deficit and so forth, do they listen? And then they say, by the way, what should I do with my own money? They are asking how they should invest their money or they never they never ask you for investment tips? Not typically. Now, what about when you go to a cocktail party? People ask you for investment ideas all the time here and there, I guess, is let me reverse the question. What do they do with you? Well, I'm not as good an investor as you are, so it worked out pretty good. Mostly say to me, Do you know Ray Dalio? So, Ray, look, I'd like to congratulate you on your incredible success. You came from very modest means. Work your way up. 50 years as an investor, built the biggest hedge fund in the world, and you've contribute a lot to endowments and others who've been your investors. So you should be very proud of what you've achieved now. I hope you can make some progress in Washington. I've been living there for a while. It's not that easy to make progress, as you know, but hopefully you'll continue and maybe some people will say they don't want to get re-elected. They just want to do the right thing. Hopefully you convince them. Thanks very much. Thank you.

Bloomberg's Zoe Tillman joins to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nBack in April when the president announced his reciprocal tariffs, the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, a handful of small businesses and a coalition of states filed suit. And for the most part, that was it. For most of the year, much of the business world did not get involved, stayed on the sidelines. Talking with trade lawyers, what they told us was there was a fear of blowback for stepping out against the administration. A number of companies wanted to wait and see what happened before sticking their necks out. But as the year drew to a close, the Supreme Court heard arguments. There was some sense that perhaps key members of the conservative wing were skeptical and the tariffs might fall. We are suddenly seeing a flood of businesses going into court, wanting to make sure that they've done everything they can to try to get refunds. If the court rules against the tariffs in the coming days or weeks. These cases are building off of those original lawsuits. They're not raising new claims. What they're saying is we agree that the tariffs are unlawful and if they fall, we think we should get our money back. So it's really a preemptive approach that these companies are taking at this point. So more than 100 corporate entities are now involved in the legal fight, including some big household company names like Costco. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. What's the feeling in legal circles here about how this Supreme Court case might go and what it might mean for some of these people that would like to get some of their money back? Right. And I should say the vast majority of companies that have sued so far are small businesses that perhaps most conservatives, consumers have never heard of. But we talked with owners who told us that the amounts that they're paying several thousand dollars, tens of thousands of dollars have been a huge hit to their bottom line and their ability to staff stock goods and so on. That said, you know, the arguments on November 5th, we saw key members of the court asking very skeptical questions about the lawfulness of the president's use of this 1977 economic emergency powers law to impose the tariffs. And once that happened, there were at least some companies that said, you know, the odds seem at least good enough that we're willing to now take steps to publicly come out against this policy. It's certainly not the case for all. We talked to lawyers who said some didn't fear the blowback. They just didn't see a need to do this until until recently. Some read headlines crossing the Bloomberg terminal here, Visa of Venezuela Assembly President Rodriguez on state television says that Venezuela should release important number of prisoners. And that's according to Venezuela Assembly President Rodriguez. So we'll have more reporting on that going forward. Zoe, is there a mechanism for, I don't know, the government, I guess, to return some of these tariffs back to companies that paid them? So there is precedent for this, just not on the scale that we would expect to see if the Supreme Court strikes down these tariffs. A number of years ago, there was a harbor maintenance tax that the Supreme Court struck down and that resulted in roughly 4000 companies going to a U.S. trade court to get refunds for the money that they had paid to the government. According to a court filing in December, looking at roughly 300,000 importers so far that have paid these contested tariffs on something like 30 plus million entries of goods into the United States. So there is a process that the trade court has used before to handle sort of a mass refund process. And there's been some expectation in some of the filings that we've seen that everyone expects that to be the way this unfolds if the tariffs are struck down. That said, you know, the administration could certainly say, you know, maybe there's an administrative process that we want to use that doesn't go through the courts. They haven't proposed anything like that and have mostly discussed this as if they to anticipate needing to go through the courts.

But the cohort has since cooled its buying, and the attacks slowed.  Bloomberg's Jeffrey Langbaum joins to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIt's one of those things that's been a target for politicians for some time because it's a very easy political message to sell. You're going after the big institutions that are crowding out the individual homebuyers, making prices too expensive. But at the end of the day, you know, these are these are well-run institutional landlords of rental homes, not unlike, you know, apartment homes. And, you know, I think that at the end of the day, if what he is suggesting he wants to do gets done in some capacity. You know, the net result probably winds up being less home inventory, which probably ends up making offsetting any positive impact on pricing that he would be looking to accomplish. Well, the only I don't know much about this business, but are they how big is institutional ownership of residential real estate in the U.S. these days? It's tiny. You know, it's I've seen numbers. It's only a couple percent of the overall housing stock. Maybe a little bit more of the overall rental housing stock. But at the end of the day, it's, you know, a majority of what is owned single family homes that are rented are owned by mom and pop small investors rather than the large institutions. But clearly the large institutions have the buying power. And that's what's being targeted here. What I mean, I guess in some fashion, the president and his administration are going after the high cost of housing, the affordable or the lack of affordability of housing in this country. From your perspective, what's going on there? How do how do we get ourselves here? And maybe how do we fix this situation? Well, I mean, the reason that there's a housing affordability issue is because there hasn't been enough built for an extended period of time. And we've we're undersupplied. And the way to get out of that is to increase supply. And anything that you do from an administrative or regulatory perspective that, you know, caps an incentive to build new supply is is the real problem here for pricing. Right now, rentals are more affordable than buying a home. I think that's pretty well understood across the board. And there's just there's not enough incentive for builders of either single-family or multifamily right now to to increase the housing supply, which really is needed to increase affordability, to improve affordability. So what do the developers, what are they are you going for like other specific remedies or looking for in terms of permitting just regulatory hurdles to build? Yeah, I mean, basically that's that's the key is improved ease of permitting. You know, maybe some private public private partnerships where there's some government input and, you know, tax incentives or things of that nature. Obviously, in markets like New York here, you know, the ability to more easily convert old, old office buildings into rental housing. But, you know, on the single family side, which is what this is really targeting, you know, one of the things that the builders are doing right now is selling their inventory to institutions who will own it and rent it. And that's being targeted. And if you take away that buyer, then, you know, it makes it harder for them to build. If they don't necessarily feel confident, they're going to be able to sell their inventory at the end of the day. Is our building restrictions their local right or not federal? Are they correct that, you know, that the permitting process and the regulations on on housing are at the local level? So, I mean, is this something I mean, are certain states certain areas, is it easier to build, harder to build, I would think in New York City be terribly hard to build something? Yeah. I mean, you can look you can look broad geographic strokes. I mean, that areas in the Sunbelt are, you know, historically much easier to build. Obviously, there's much more land, but also the regulatory environment is easier. And so that's where there's historically been significant, more construction and and the demand has followed. And so, you know, typically supply and demand work on their own. And, you know, the government stays out of it, the federal government stays out of it. And so, you know, at the end of the day, I'm not really sure exactly what's going to be able to be done here. It feels like banning specific owners of properties from playing in a in a private market transaction is is interesting. We'll see. We'll you know, but but clearly he's making life difficult for these companies.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:23:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T17:47:00.371847"}

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nSCARLETT: LET'S SHOW YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE MARKETS. ON THE FACE OF IT THE S & P 500 IS UNCHANGED. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IN THE 11 GROUPS OF THE S & P 500 ONLY TWO SECTORS ARE NOT GAINING. TECH IS DOWN 1.8% AND HEALTH CARE IS MARGINALLY LOWER. YIELDS HAVE BEEN BOUNCED AROUND. RIGHT NOW THE 10 YEAR YIELD IS HIGHER AFTER TODAY'S JOBS DATA WHICH WILL GET INTO IN A LITTLE BIT. I WANTED TO INCLUDE ITA, THE TICKER THAT TRACKS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE. UP .9%. EARLIER IT WAS UP A LOT MORE AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNALED PLANS TO RAMP UP MILITARY SPENDING. OIL REMAINS IN THE SPOTLIGHT, RECOUPING EARLIER DECLINES AS TRADERS CONTINUE TO BALANCE THE NEWS U.S. WILL ASSERT CONTROL OVER VENEZUELA AND DEFINITELY AT A TIME THERE IS PLENTY OF SUPPLY OF OIL. WE WILL DIG INTO ALL OF THAT LATER ON. AS INVESTORS WAIT TOMORROW'S BIG DATA POINT, THE U.S. JOBS REPORT, AND A POTENTIAL MARKET MOVING EVENT OF THE SUPREME COURT RULES ON TARIFFS. WE DID GET AN APPETIZER AND ECONOMIC DATA TODAY. THE TRADE DEFICIT IS SHRINKING TO ITS NARROWEST IN 2009. YOU WOULD US PRODUCTIVITY ACCELERATED TO ITS FASTEST PACE IN THOSE TWO YEARS -- U.S. PRODUCTIVITY ACCELERATED TO ITS FASTEST PLACE IN THOSE TWO YEARS. EARLIER TODAY WE SPOKE WITH FED GOVERNOR STEPHEN MIRAN AND BEGAN BY ASKING HIM IF THE HEAVY NEWS FLOW TO START 2026 HAS CHANGED HIS OUTLOOK ON RATES FOR THE YEAR. > > I AM UNSURPRISINGLY THE LOWEST DOT. I AM LOOKING FOR ABOUT A POINT AND A HALF OF CUTS. ALL THAT IS DRIVEN BY MY VIEW ON INFLATION. MY VIEW IS ALMOST ALL OF THE EXCESS INFLATION OVER TARGET IS DUE TO QUIRKS OF HOW WE CALCULATE INFLATION. SCARLET: TO PROCESS THIS DATA LET'S BRING IN JULIET WHO COVERS U.S. ECONOMY FOR BLOOMBERG. I AM SORRY FOR BUTCHERING YOUR NAME. LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THE DATA POINTS. COMING INTO THIS REPORT JAY POWELL HAS CHARACTERIZED THE REPORT AS LOW HIGHER AND LOW FIRE. JULIANA: IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2025 IT WAS LOW HIGHER OR LOW FIRE. YOU ARE SEEING IT WAS HARD FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE LABOR FORCE TO FIND JOBS. ECONOMISTS WERE LOOKING BECAUSE IN NOVEMBER AND OCTOBER THE CHALLENGERS SHOWED THAT LAYOFF ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE HITTING SOME OF THE HIGHEST IN DECADES. WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS TRANSLATE TO HARD DATA. AS OF YET IT HAS NOT TRANSLATED. INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS HAVE NOT SHIFTED THAT MUCH THERE A LOT OF EYES ON IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WILL TICK UP IN DECEMBER . THERE HAS BEEN A WAIT AND SEE TO THAT. DIFFICULTY WAS BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN A LOT OF FORECASTERS DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE DATA. THEY WERE LOOKING AT PRIVATE REPORTS SUCH AS ADP AND CHALLENGERS TO TRY TO READ THE TEA LEAVES OF THE LABOR MARKET. SCARLET: YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THOSE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF LABOR BECOME MORE IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD EVEN WITH RESUMPTION OF GOVERNMENT DATA? JULIA: ABSOLUTELY. I FEEL THE PRIVATE DATA SOURCES HAVE STEPPED UP IN THIS MOMENT TO TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT. I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE PRIVATE DATA SOURCES AS PART OF THE BROADER PICTURE AS WELL. SCARLET: THE OVERALL LABOR MARKET EVEN AS WE TALK ABOUT LOW HIGHER AND LOW FIRE IS FAIRLY RESILIENT. YOU'VE POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS WERE THAT IS NOT THE CASE, THEY ARE NOT SEEING THE KIND OF LABOR MARKET GAINS. THEY ARE SEEING JOB LOSSES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE. WHAT DOES THAT SHOW? JULIA: THAT SHOWS THAT THESE POCKETS -- THEY ARE SHARING THE CRACKS OF THE LABOR MARKET. ECONOMISTS ARE TRYING TO GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT, EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE JOB GAINS ARE, THEY ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN HEALTH CARE. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SEEING A RESILIENT LABOR MARKET IS ONLY IN THESE DIFFERENT POCKETS AND THAT IS WHY ECONOMISTS ARE SO LASER FOCUS ON WHAT WILL COME BACK TOMORROW. SCARLET: AFTER THIS JOBS REPORT WHAT IS THE NEXT GLIMPSE IN TERMS OF DATA THAT WILL PROVIDE THE FED WITH ANY SENSE OF HOW IT MOVES FORWARD WITH RATE CUTS? JULIA: CPI WILL BE SOMETHING THEY LOOK AFTER. THEY HAVE A DUAL MANDATE WHICH IS INFLATION AND FULL EMPLOYMENT. EVEN THOUGH THE INFLATION NUMBERS WERE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, THAT IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT THING COMING IN NEXT WEEK. SCARLET: EVEN IF THE DATA IS NOT CLEAN IT IS BETTER DATA THAN IT HAD BEEN IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. JULIA COVERING THE ECONOMIC DATA FOR US AT BLOOMBERG. FOR MORE ON HOW POLICYMAKERS ARE DOING THESE ECONOMY, FOLDING IN ON THE DATA AVAILABLE TO THEM, LET'S BRING IN BETSY STEPHENSON, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND A FORMER MEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS AND THE FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. IT IS GREAT TO SPEAK WITH YOU. THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM INTO 2026 WAS A LABOR MARKET WAS SLOWING AND THE SLOW DOWN WOULD INTENSIFY THIS YEAR. THE LATEST DATA COMING OUT SHOWS WE STILL HAVE A FAIRLY LOW FIRE ENVIRONMENT. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? BETSY: WE DO HAVE A LOW FIRE ENVIRONMENT. UNFORTUNATELY YOU ALSO HAVE A LOW HIGHER ENVIRONMENT. WHAT THAT MEANS IS PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF THE LABOR MARKET WILL STRUGGLE TO GET BACK IN. IF YOU LOOK AT DATA WHERE PEOPLE ARE ASKED HOW HARD YOU THINK IT IS TO FIND A JOB, WE ARE SEEING THEY THINK IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND A JOB RIGHT NOW. IF YOU CAN HANG ONTO TO YOUR JOB THINGS ARE GREAT. IF YOU CANNOT HANG ONTO YOUR JOB IT COULD BE DISMAL. I THINK THAT IS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT CREATES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ANXIETY FOR PEOPLE. SCARLET: WE ARE SEEING THAT SHOW UP IN SURVEYS ABOUT SENTIMENT AND CONFIDENCE EVEN IT DOES NOT CARRY INTO SPENDING JUST YET. TECHNICALLY WE ARE FAR FROM A RECESSION. THERE IS GROWTH BUT THERE ARE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS THAT ARE SEEING DETERIORATION AWAY IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH A SOLID ECONOMY WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE GRADUATES OR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN THE LABOR MARKET INTO DISTINCT GROUPS? BETSY: FIRST I WOULD SAY LET'S LOOK AT THE LABOR MARKET IN TERMS OF WHERE THE JOBS ARE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THE LABOR MARKET THAT HAS SETTLED BACK INTO A WEAK LABOR MARKET WHERE MOST OF THE JOB GROWTH IS OCCURRING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH SERVICES SECTOR AND A LITTLE BIT IN THAT LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY. EVERYBODY ELSE IS SLOW. THE JOBS REPORT WE WILL SEE AT THE END OF THIS WEEK, IS INTERESTING TO SEE DID WE ADD JOBS IN IMPORTANT AREA, BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, WHICH IS WHERE A LOT OF HIGH-QUALITY JOBS ARE. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MANUFACTURING WHICH IS BEEN SHEDDING JOBS ALL YEAR DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO BOOST MANUFACTURING. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS A LABOR MARKET WHERE MOST INDUSTRIES ARE PRETTY MUCH FROZEN AND THE GROWTH WE HAVE THAT IS KEEPING US OUT OF RECESSION FROM A LABOR MARKET PERSPECTIVE IS HAPPENING IN A VERY NARROW SLICE OF THE ECONOMY. YOU TURN TO THE STOCK MARKET AND YOU SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR WHICH IS THE GROWTH WE ARE HAVING OCCURRING IN A VERY NARROW SLICE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE IT IS DIFFERENT. IT IS THE AI DRIVEN BOOM HITTING A FEW COMPANIES GENERATING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF GROWTH. IT IS PAPERING OVER THE IDEA THAT A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES ARE NOT LOOKING QUITE AS GREAT. SCARLET: FROM WHERE YOU SIT HOW MUCH OF THE AI STORY -- I'M TALKING ABOUT THE AI COMPLEX, THE SPENDING WITH AI AND THE PLANNING WITH AI AS OPPOSED TO THE USE OF AI TO TAKE AWAY JOBS, HOW MUCH OF THAT IS AFFECTING THE LABOR MARKET OR HAVE WE YET TO SEE THE FULL IMPACT? BETSEY: FOR SURE WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE FULL IMPACT. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE WHICH IS YOU DO NOT LAY ANYBODY OFF BECAUSE YOU START USING AI. YOU MIGHT THINK TWICE ABOUT WHO YOU NEED TO HIRE. THAT IS WHY IT WILL IMPACT THE EARLY YOUNG PEOPLE'S ENTRY INTO THE LABOR MARKET. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A WEEK ECONOMY OR A WEAKENING, IT IS THE VERB, NOT THE LEVEL OF THE ECONOMY ITSELF IS OK. IF WE THINK IT IS WEAKENING AND YOU THINK THERE IS A RISK OF WEAKENING AND YOU ARE A COMPANY THE FIRST THING YOU ALWAYS DO IS CUT BACK ON YOUR HIRING. IF YOU ALSO THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEPLOY AI OPTIONS OR AI TOOLS THAT IS GOING TO WHERE I REALLY DO NOT NEED TO TAKE THE RISK OF BRINGING ON MORE HEADCOUNT IF I WOULD GET THIS HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY OUT OF THE PEOPLE I CURRENTLY HAVE UNLESS I THINK THAT WILL TRANSLATE TO HIGHER SALES. MORE PRODUCTIVITY IS GREAT AS LONG AS IT TRANSLATES TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT IS JUST AN EXCUSE FOR EMPLOYERS TO CUT BACK ON HIRING. SCARLET: COMPANIES ARE IN THIS MOMENT OF TRANSITION GETTING READY FOR THE FULL IMPACT OF AI. HOW DO POLICYMAKERS FOLD THAT IN. POLICYMAKERS AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE VERSUS POLICYMAKERS IN GOVERNMENT, THOSE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE FISCAL POLICY? BETSEY: FROM A MONETARY POLICY PERSPECTIVE SOME OF IT IS THE SAME WHICH IS THEY NEED TO BE PURSUING THEIR DUAL MANDATE AND SAYING WHAT CAN THEY DO TO MAKE SURE THE LABOR MARKET IS AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE. THEY HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT CREATING HIGH PRESSURE. AI SHOULD MAKE IT SO WE CAN BRUISE A LOT MORE STUFF. ONE WAY YOU HAVE TO FOLD IT IN HIS HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH EXPECTATIONS IN THE LONG RUN. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT AND FRANKLY WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FORECASTS WE ARE SEEING OUT OF THE FOMC TO SEE WHAT ARE WE STARTING TO BREAK IN THAT HIGHER GROWTH WE MIGHT EXPECT FROM AI. FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE THERE IS A LOT TO DO, PROBABLY MORE THAN WE CAN DISCUSS. WE WILL NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT WHO WILL BE THE IMMEDIATE WINNERS FROM AI AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE ALL OF SOCIETY BENEFITS. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS CHANGE AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ELEVATE ALL OF HUMANITY. EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALL OF HUMANITY. IT WILL TAKE POLICY TO MAKE SURE ALL OF HUMANITY IS ELEVATED AS OPPOSED TO DESTROYED. IF YOU SPEND TIME WITH THE TECH GUYS AND GALS WHO WORK ON AI THERE IS A LOT OF RISK AS WELL IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. SCARLET: ARE YOU ENCOURAGED BITING SIGNS FROM POLICYMAKERS THEY ARE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY? YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF THAT? BETSEY: I DON'T. I WISH I DID. THERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF POLICYMAKERS THINKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL AMERICANS GET THEIR SHARE. AI IS BUILT ON ALL OF OUR DATA. WE SHOULD BE HAVING REAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT IS THE SHARE, WHAT ARE THE RETURNS PEOPLE SHOULD BE GETTING FROM THE FACT THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE BUILDING THEIR FOUNDATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS, EVERY PERSON AROUND THE GLOBE IS MADE FOR CENTURIES. SCARLET: THAT IS A BIGGER DISCUSSION. ALWAYS A PLEASURE SPEAKING WITH YOU. BETSEY STEVENSON, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. LET'S STEER AWAY FROM MACRO ECONOMICS AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EQUITIES AND CHECK OUT A COUPLE INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MOVERS AND BRING IN OUR MARKETS CORRESPONDENT NORAH MULINDA FOR A LOOK AT THAT. NORAH: WE HAVE SEEN ALPHABET SURPASS APPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2019. WE HAVE NVIDIA AS THE TOP STOCK BUT WE HAVE SEEN ALPHABET SHARES SLOTTED IN IS THE SECOND BIGGEST STOCK RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKET. LET'S MOVE FROM THE TECH SPACE INTO THE FED. WE HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF COMMENTARY FROM DONALD TRUMP ON TRUTH SOCIAL. I'VE MY EYES ON LOCKHEED MARTIN. WE PLAN TO INCREASE THE U.S. MILITARY SPENDING BUDGET TO $1.5 TRILLION, A 50% INCREASE BY 2027. WE ARE SEEING THE MARKET CONTINUE TO DIGEST THIS. DID SEE A SLUMP FOR A LOT OF THESE NAMES BECAUSE SOME OF HIS PLANS COULD THREATEN TO CUT OUT SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT PLAN TO BENEFIT IN TERMS OF THE PROFIT BOOST. YOU ARE SEEING THE MARKET STILL DISSECT THIS BUT WE ARE SEEING A REBOUND ON THE DAY. LET'S END THINGS WITH THE HOUSING MARKET. SHARES OF HOMES REBOUNDING AFTER A SLUMP THAT TOOK IT TOWARDS HIS BIGGEST DROP IN SIX MONTHS. WE ARE SEEING SHARES UP .9% WHEN WE LOOK AT INVITATION HOMES AS WELL AS AMERICAN HOMES AFTER DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE PLANS TO CRACK DOWN ON INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SNATCHING UP A LOT OF THE U.S. HOMES. THAT IS ALL WE HAVE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. SCARLET: BLOOMBERG'S MARKETS CORRESPONDENT NORAH MULINDA AND WE WILL STAY ON THAT BECAUSE COMING UP WE LOOK AT HOW REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD VIEW THIS PROPOSAL TO BAN INVESTORS FROM BUYING INDIVIDUAL HOMES. JONATHAN MILLER JOINS US NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: THIS IS BLOOMBERG MARKETS. I'M SCARLET FU. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO BAN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FROM BUYING SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES. HE SAYS HOUSING SHOULD BE FOR PEOPLE AND CORPORATIONS. HIS PROPOSAL SPARKED MARKET REACTION ON HOMEBUILDER STOCKS AND LANDLORDS OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES. LET'S BRING IN JONATHAN MILLER, PRESIDENT AND COFOUNDER OF THE REAL ESTATE APPRAISAL AND CONSULTING FIRM MILLER SAMUEL. YOU AND OTHER EXPERTS HAVE MADE THE POINT THAT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE NOT A BIG PLAYER IN THE SINGLE-FAMILY RENTAL MARKET. YET THEY MAKE FOR A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT. WHY IS THAT. JONATHAN: THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN THE PUBLIC EYE, VERY VISIBLE. THEY ONLY ACCOUNT FOR 1% OF THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING STOCK. BANNING THEM FROM PURCHASING, PERCEPTION WITH THE PUBLIC IS THEY DOMINATE INVENTORY, THEY BASICALLY, ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF HOUSING AND WHY WE ARE IN AN AND PORTABILITY CRISIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS BEEN IN ADEQUATE SUPPLY. THERE ARE VERY TINY, A 1% NUMBER. ON TOP OF IT THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IS IN THE SOUTH, WHICH HAS EXCESS SUPPLY. I AM HAVING A HARD TIME CONNECTING THE DOTS ON HOW THIS WILL HELP IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. I THINK IT IS A NON-ISSUE FOR SOLVING THAT PROBLEM. SCARLET: YOU MAKE A LOT OF IMPORTANT POINTS. HOUSING SUPPLY IS VERY LOCAL. WHEN IT COMES TO PERCEPTIONS THERE IS THE SENSE THESE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND WALL STREET FIRMS LIKE A BLACKSTONE PLAY THIS OUTSIZED ROLE IN PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY CAME IN DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OR IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND DID SWOOP IN AND BUY A LOT OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES AT A TIME WHEN AMERICANS WERE LOSING THEIR HOMES. THAT LOOMS LARGE IN THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS. SCARLET: -- JONATHAN: ABSOLUTELY. PERCEPTION IS VALUE. THEY WERE HIGHLY VISIBLE COMING IN AND SCOOPING UP 2012-2013, A TREMENDOUS VOLUME OF FORECLOSED HOMES AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND HAVE MADE IT WORK. SOME OF THE FIRMS HAVE SOLD OFF PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIOS AS THE MARKET HAS PEAKED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I SEE THIS AS DISCONNECTED FROM WHAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IS. THE PROBLEM IS TO ENHANCE AFFORDABILITY AND I DON'T THINK THE INSTITUTIONAL ASPECT OF THE HOUSING MARKET HAS MUCH TO DO WITH IT. SCARLET: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SUGGESTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. ELIZABETH WARREN HAS ALSO SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT THIS IS A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO TRYING TO TACKLE AFFORDABILITY IN THE HOUSING MARKET. THAT TAKES A LONG TIME. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OVERNIGHT. JONATHAN: AND ALSO A LOT OF THE HOUSING WE ARE BUILDING IS QUEUING TO THE HIGHER END BECAUSE OF LAND COSTS AND PRODUCT COSTS AND LABOR COSTS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS MAKE IT DIFFICULT. IF YOU CREATE OVERSUPPLY OR MODEST OVERSUPPLY. IF YOU CREATE OVERSUPPLY IT MELTS INTO HOUSING PRICES. IT IS NOT A SUREFIRE SOLUTION BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. THE OTHER THING IS A LOT OF THE CHALLENGE OF SINGLE-FAMILY AFFORDABILITY HAS BEEN ZONING IN CITIES LIKE MINNEAPOLIS HAVE BANNED THE SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING, NEW CONSTRUCTION WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY AND TRYING TO MOVE TOWARDS MULTI FAMILY AND HIGH DENSITY AREAS. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. HE REPORTED THAT BOTH SIDES OF THE ISLE ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IN THAT INVENTORY IS VERY LOCAL AND VERY REGIONAL. WHEN WE LOOK AT MARKETS LIKE THE NORTHEAST OR THE MIDWEST, VERY TIGHT IN TERMS OF SUPPLY. WE LOOK AT THE SUNBELT, VERY SOFT BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING DURING THE MIGRATION PATTERN WE SAW DURING COVID WHERE PEOPLE LEFT THE NORTHEAST AND THE WEST COAST TO GO TO MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT SOON ENDED BECAUSE THE DEMAND WAS SO HIGH. YOU HAVE REMEMBER THAT MORTGAGE RATES ARE DOUBLE WHAT THEY WERE AND STILL HOUSING PRICES ARE RISING. IT IS ALL ABOUT SUPPLY. SCARLET: IT ALL COMES DOWN TO SUPPLY. JONATHAN MILLER. SUPPLY IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. COMING UP CHINA MAY REOPEN THE DOOR TO BUYING NVIDIA CHIPS. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT. SCARLET: WE HAVE A MIXED STOCK MARKET WITH TECH SHARES DRIED LOWER BY NVIDIA EVEN AS BLOOMBERG SHOWS CHINA PLANS TO IMPORT SOME NVIDIA CHIPS AS SOON AS THIS QUARTER. CAROLINE HYDE JUNE SAYS -- CAROLINE HYDE JOINS US FROM LAS VEGAS. THIS IS SOMETHING NVIDIA INVESTORS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. CAROLINE: THEY ARE AND MAYBE ALREADY PRICED IN IN THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SEEING THE STOCK MARKET ALREADY REACT. THERE ARE A LOT OF HIGH HOPES AS TO HOW MUCH THIS MARKET CAN BE FOR NVIDIA. $50 BILLION IS WHAT THEY ARE PERCEIVED IN TERMS OF DEMAND AND ALREADY YOU HAVE JENSEN HUANG TAKE TO THE STAGE SAYING WE ARE ABLE, IF THE H200'S, IF WE ARE ABLE TO GET THE LICENSES AND IF CHINA WANTS THEM WE ARE SEEING STRONG DEMAND. THERE IS ALREADY REPORTING THAT SOME 2000 CHIPS ARE WANTED BY BYD AND ALIBABA. THAT WILL BOOST THE REVENUE. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT HAD 95% MARKET SHARE IN CHINA WHEN IT CAME TO CHIPS. IT NOW HAS 0% UNLESS ALLOWED TO ACCESS EVER SINCE IT WAS CURTAILED FROM THAT MARKET UNLESS -- IN 2022. IF THEY DO GET THE LICENSE THEY WANT TO SHARE SOME THE REVENUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND IF THIS IS ALLOWED IN THE CHINESE ALLOWED FOR THEIR COMPANIES, NOT FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT ALSO FOR THE MILITARY AND ENTERPRISES RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS. IT WILL BE A BIG BOOM IN TERMS OF REVENUE FOR NVIDIA. IT IS INTERESTING THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT REACTING THE WAY YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE. SCARLET: WHAT ABOUT CHINA'S OWN CHIPMAKERS? BEIJING WAS TRYING TO GIVE THEM TIME TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN ADVANCED AI CHIPS. ARE THEY DOING WITH THAT MUCH OF MARK CAROLINE: PHENOMENALLY WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR STOCK PRICES. THERE IS A NEW STAR PLAYER WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORLD OF CHIPS. WHILE WEIGHT BEEN MAKING INROADS. -- HUAWEI HAS BEEN MAKING INROADS. MANY WOULD SAY WE ARE'S FOR -- WE ARE -- HOW SOPHISTICATED CHINA IS. WE JUST HAD JACOB HELBERG ON THE SHOW, HE IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ABOUT THE RESILIENCY AND NATIONAL SECURITY EFFORTS OF MAKING SURE CHIPS ARE MADE IN THE U.S. WERE MADE BY ALLIED PARTNERS. HE SAYS FROM A MARKET SHARE PERSPECTIVE MAYBE YOU DO WANT NVIDIA TO ACCESS CHINA. SCARLET: CAROLINE HYDE, APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. CAROLINE HYDE REPORTING FROM THE FLOOR OF CES IN LAS VEGAS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: WELCOME TO \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" WE HAVE A STOCK MARKET THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE S & P 500 UNCHANGED. TACK IS DOWN ON THE DAY. CONSUMER STAPLES ARE HIGHER. TREASURY YIELDS ARE MOVING SLIGHTLY HIGHER. JOBS DATA SHOW THE LABOR MARKET IS HOLDING UP BETTER THAN FEARED. THAT IS IN THE LEAD UP TO TOMORROW'S MONTHLY JOBS REPORT AT 8:30 A.M. DEFENSE COMPANIES ARE MOVING HIGHER ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SIGNALING TO RAMP UP MILITARY SPENDING. CRUDE OIL UP BY MORE THAN 2%. THERE'S A LOT OF NEWS OUT THERE THAT INCLUDES THE U.S. EXERTING CONTROL OVER VENEZUELAN OIL AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS PLENTY OF SUPPLY. LET'S STICK WITH EQUITIES AND TURN TO NORAH MULINDA FOR INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MOVERS. NORAH: THE SAGA BETWEEN WARNER BROS., PARAMOUNT AND NETFLIX. PARAMOUNT CAME OUT REAFFIRMING ITS OFFER FOR WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY IN CASH. $30 PER SHARE. WE SEE THEM UNDERSCORING THEIR BID DESPITE THE FACT THEY RECEIVED MULTIPLE REJECTIONS. THEY ARE ARGUING IT IS STILL SUPERIOR TO THE COMPETITOR, NETFLIX. WE HAVE OUR EYES ON ROBOTAXIS AND A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AT THE INTERSECTION OF TECHNOLOGY. FORWARD HINTING AT THE FACT IT COULD BE UNVEILING OR ENTERING THE ROBOTAXI SPACE. SHARES UP BY MORE THAN 5% AS INVESTORS DIGEST THAT NEWS. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND VENEZUELA. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE ENERGY SECRETARY THAT U.S. OIL COMPANIES ARE HOPING TO EXAMINE WHAT ROLE THEY CAN PLAY IN TERMS OF REVITALIZING THE VENEZUELAN ENERGY SECTOR. LOOK AT CHEVRON UP ABOUT 1.7% AFTER THE ENERGY SAID THIS COMPANY COULD RAMP UP QUICKLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ACTIVITY AND VENEZUELA AND THE OIL SECTOR MORE BROADLY. EXXON AND CONOCOPHILLIPS IN FOCUS AS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT BEING INTERESTED IN THIS DEVELOPMENT. ALL SHARES ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE GREEN. SCARLET: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. TURNING TO A STORY AT CROSSING THE TERMINAL, THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERING A BIPARTISAN SLATE OF NOMINATIONS FOR THE CFTC. THAT'S ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR. THAT WOULD MEAN THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC PIC FOR A MAJOR WALL STREET REGULATOR IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. LYDIA HELPED BREAK THE STORY FOR BLOOMBERG. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING OF PULLING -- PUTTING FORWARD DEMOCRATIC NOMINEES FOR THIS REGULATOR? LYDIA: IT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT IN THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AT ANY INDEPENDENT AGENCY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. THE SEC IS DOWN TO JUST THREE REPUBLICANS, NO DEMOCRATS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AS WELL. WE KNOW AT LEAST THE CFTC SEEMS TO BE THE INITIAL PRIORITY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN DECIDING WHETHER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A BIPARTISAN SLATE. SCARLET: ONE REASON IS BECAUSE THE CFTC, EVEN THOUGH IT REGULATES THE DERIVATIVES AND SWAPS MARKET, IT IS TAKING ON A LARGER ROLE. IT IS CONTENDING WITH CRYPTO AND PREDICTION MARKETS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN BOOMING GROWTH WITH POLYMARKET PICKING UP A LOT OF ATTENTION. TALK ABOUT THE REMIT OF THE CFTC RIGHT NOW GIVEN IT IS SO UNDERSTAFFED. LYDIA: YOU ARE RIGHT. THEY ONLY HAVE ONE COMMISSIONER, THE NEW CHAIRMAN MICHAEL SELIG. THEY ARE VERY BUSY. PREDICTION MARKETS HAVE TAKEN OVER AT THE AGENCY. WITH CONGRESS DEBATING WHETHER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE, LEGISLATION THAT COULD GIVE MORE AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE THE DIGITAL ASSET MARKET. THIS BIPARTISAN SLATE UNDER CONSIDERATION PLAYS INTO THAT. DEMOCRATS HAVE ASKED FOR A QUORUM REQUIREMENT AT BOTH AGENCIES TO BE PUT IN PLACE SO THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE MEMBERS OF MINORITY PARTY IN THE FUTURE. THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE MY MARK -- MINORITY MEMBERS FOR ANY ACTION AND THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT IF THE BILL PASSES AND THE AGENCIES GET MORE CRYPTO AUTHORITY. SCARLET: THE CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE LEGISLATION IS SOMETHING WE ARE STILL AWAITING. COULD IT GET DONE BEFORE A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IS INSTALLED ON THE CFTC? WOULDN'T LIKELY BE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME? LYDIA: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND COMES DOWN TO IF THE WHITE HOUSE DECIDES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH BIPARTISAN NOMINEES AT ALL. WE ARE EXPECTING A MARKUP IN THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE ON THEIR VERSION OF THE BILL NEXT WEEK. A WEEK FROM TODAY. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT, IF THE MARKUP IS SUCCESSFUL TO GET THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE, WE WILL SEE. TYPICALLY THE NOMINEES TAKE MANY MONTHS TO COME THROUGH THE WHOLE CONFIRMATION PROCESS ONCE THEY ARE EVEN OUT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS HARD TO SAY WHERE -- WHETHER THOSE TRACKS WILL ALIGN AT ALL. SCARLET: LYDIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ON PERHAPS THE WHITE HOUSE IS CONSIDERING A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR THE CFTC. AS A PROMISE, DEFENSE STOCKS LIKE LOCKHEED MARTIN ARE JUMPING IN THE SESSION AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS FOR A MASSIVE INCREASE IN THE U.S.'S MILITARY BUDGET. UP NEXT, THE STOCKS OF THE HOUR. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: IT IS TIME FOR OUR STOCK OF THE HOUR. DEFENSE STOCKS ARE RISING UP TO THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS TO INCREASE THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY BUDGET BY 50% TO ONE POINT $5 TRILLION IN 2027. LET'S BRING IN AEROSPACE DEFENSE AND AIRLINE ANALYST GEORGE FERGUSON. WE ARE SEEING NAMES LIKE LOCKHEED MARTIN TAKE OFF ON THIS VAGUE ANNOUNCEMENT. A 50% JUMP IN THE BUDGET SOUNDS HUGE. $1.5 TRILLION. IS THAT SOMETHING THE INDUSTRY COULD SPEND? GEORGE: IT WILL BE DIFFICULT. IT'S A 50% JUMP OVER THE $1 TRILLION WE SAW UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. EVEN IF YOU GET A COUPLE OF YEARS PRIOR TO THAT BACK DURING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, 800 TO 900. THAT'S A CONSIDERABLE JUMP IN THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS. THIS IS A HEAVY INDUSTRY BUSINESS. THE EQUIPMENT YOU BUY FOR THE MILITARY HAS LONG LEAD TIME ITEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO MOVE THROUGH PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY THAT ARE CONSTRICTED. THERE MIGHT BE FORGINGS AND CASTINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU COULD TRY TO SPEND 1.5 BILLION A YEAR AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SUPER INEFFICIENT. I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DO ON THE U.S. BUDGET AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO TRY TO EVEN OUT AN INCREASE OVER TIME THEN MAKE IT LUMPY RISE AND FALL. SCARLET: I GET THE SENSE PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT BE PATIENT, WANT TO SEE MOVIE -- SEE SOMETHING MOVING MORE QUICKLY. DO WE PRESUME THIS WOULD BE SPENT ON U.S. MANUFACTURERS? COULD SOME GO TO EUROPEAN MANUFACTURERS? GEORGE: U.S. LAW SAYS IT IS HARD TO BE BUILDING THIS STUFF OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. SOME EUROPEAN COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE U.S. DEFENSE INDUSTRY BUT THEY TYPICALLY BUILD HERE IN THE U.S. AND TYPICALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT U.S. MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT TO DO IT. I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO IT THROUGH THE EXISTING FOOTPRINT HERE. EUROPE IS BUSY WRAPPING UP DEFENSE SPENDING THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE INCREASES AS WELL IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IT IS NOT LIKE THEIR INDUSTRY IS NOT BUSY TRYING TO EXPAND VERY QUICKLY AS WELL AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME LIMITATIONS WE DO. SCARLET: GEORGE, APPRECIATE YOU SPEAKING WITH US ABOUT THIS. GEORGE FERGUSON OF BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE. COMING UP, THE CO-CREATORS OF HBO'S \"INDUSTRY\" DISCUSS WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR ENTERTAINMENT OVER ALL IN 2026. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: I'M SCARLET FU AND THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" PARAMOUNT REAFFIRMING IS OFFER FOR PARAMOUNT -- WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY FOR $30 A SHARE. THIS COMES UP TO AGAIN REJECTED PARAMOUNT'S OFFER YESTERDAY. LET'S BRING IN MICHELLE DAVIS FOR MORE. IT FEELS LIKE EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR PARAMOUNT TO RAISE THE BID BUT IT IS NOT DOING THAT. WHY NOT? MICHELLE: THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION. THINGS ARE AT AN IMPASSE HERE. HERE MATT HAS ESSENTIALLY BROUGHT THE SAME OFFER NOW 3, 4 TIMES TO WARNER BROS. WARNER BROS. HAS REJECTED THE SAME OFFER. IN PARAMOUNT'S MOST RECENT OFFER, THEY DID OFFER TO BACKSTOP THE EQUITY. ELLISON BACKSTOPPED THE EQUITY. WARNER BROS. SAID THERE WAS A GREAT MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THERE ARE ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES WITH THE OFFER. IT IS RISKY. THE BIGGEST OF ALL TIME. THERE'S A LOT OF DEBT COMING OUT OF IT. IT DOES NOT OFFER A LOT OF VALUE. WHY ARE THEY TALKING PAST EACH OTHER? PARAMOUNT SAID WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING. WE CATERED TO WARNER BROS. AND WARNER BROS. IS NOT ENGAGING. WARNER BROS. SAID WE TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. THERE SEEMS TO BE MISCOMMUNICATION. SCARLET: IT FEELS LIKE PARAMOUNT IS NOT HELPING ITSELF. IN THE LATEST REAFFIRMATION THEY ACTUALLY SAID THE CABLE CHANNELS THEY ARE ALSO INCLUDING IN THEIR OFFER IS WORTH NOTHING, WHICH IS KIND OF CURIOUS. WHY DO THEY WANT THAT? MICHELLE: IT DOES BENEFIT THEM TO SAY THE CABLE NETWORKS ARE WORTH NOTHING BECAUSE THEIR OFFER IS TECHNICALLY WORTH MORE THAN NETFLIX'S BECAUSE NETFLIX'S WOULD BE -- IT'S AN INTERESTING TACTIC. I WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE. IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS WAIT FOR NETFLIX'S STOCK PRICE TO KEEP DECLINING AND REGULATORS TO SAY WE DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD DEAL AND MAYBE WAIT FOR NETFLIX OR WARNER BROS. TO GET COLD FEET AND THEN BECOME MORE AMENABLE TO THE DEAL, OR WAIT FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO PRESSURE THE OFFER. SCARLET: HOW HAVE SHAREHOLDERS RESPONDED SO FAR? THIS IS A HOSTILE BID. HAVE THEY TENDERED THEIR OFFERS? MICHELLE: PARAMOUNT PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SAYING ABOUT 1% OF SHAREHOLDERS HAD TENDERED THEIR SHARES. NOT VERY MANY AT ALL. OFTEN IN THESE SITUATIONS, PEOPLE WAIT UNTIL THE END TO REALLY TENDER. THAT COULD BE PART OF WHAT IS HOLDING THINGS UP. PARAMOUNT EXTENDED THE TENDER OFFICE TO JANUARY 21. THERE IS MORE TIME FOR THEM TO MAKE THE ROUNDS OF INVESTORS AND CONVINCED SOME THAT THEY SHOULD GO THIS WAY. SO FAR WE HAVE HEARD SOME SUPPORT, SOME SHAREHOLDERS. THERE WAS A LETTER SENT TO WARNER BROS. THAT SAID WE WANT YOU TO ENGAGE, WHY AREN'T YOU? OTHERS SAY WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT IF PARAMOUNT DOES NOT RAISE THE BID? SCARLET: WHAT WILL MOVE THE SAGA ALONG? MICHELLE: THERE IS A SHAREHOLDER VOTE AND THINGS NOT NECESSARILY SCHEDULED BUT WE ARE WAITING FOR. MAYBE PARAMOUNT WILL RAISE THE BID OR WE WILL GET SOME SIGNALS OUT OF REGULATORS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE FEELING ABOUT THE EXISTING DEAL ON THE TABLE OR THE PARAMOUNT DEAL. MAYBE PARAMOUNT WILL AMEND THE OFFER. THERE IS A LOT THAT COULD HAPPEN. THE ONE TRUE CATALYST IS THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE. SCARLET: NETFLIX HAS NOT SAID ANYTHING. MICHELLE: THEY APPLAUDED THE WARNER BROS. BOARD FOR REAFFIRMING THEIR EXISTING DEAL AND FOR SEEING THE RECENT OFFER WAS NOT AS EQUAL FOOTING TO THE HE -- TO THERE'S. -- THEIRS. SCARLET: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING US UP-TO-DATE ON THIS BIDDING WAR. WHETHER IT INCLUDES THE CABLE CHANNELS WERE NOT IS UP TO CONTENTION. ONE OF THE WARNER BROS. ASSETS IS HBO. SUNDAY NIGHT IS SHORTHAND FOR PRESTIGE TV. SHOWS LIKE THE SOPRANOS, GAME OF THRONES, SUCCESSION, WHITE LOTUS. THIS SUNDAY MEANS THE SEASON 4 PREMIERE OF INDUSTRY ABOUT INTERNATIONAL FINANCE SET IN LONDON. I SAT DOWN WITH THE SHOW RUNNERS FOR THEIR FIRST TV INTERVIEW AHEAD OF THE SUNDAY PREMIERE. > > SEASON ON SEASON, WE TRY TO EXPAND THE HORIZON OF THE SHOW AND BROADEN THE THEMES. WE REALIZE IN SEASON THREE WE WERE NOT JUST WRITING ABOUT FINANCE. WE WERE WRITING ABOUT INTERSECTIONS OF MEDIA, POLITICS, FINANCE, THE QUID PRO QUO AND THE BACKSCRATCHING AND WE WANTED TO MAKE THE SHOW SLIGHTLY MORE UNIVERSAL. THEY'RE STILL OF REAL FINANCIAL THRILLER ENGINE BUT IT HAS A WIDER SCOPE. SCARLET: THIS SHOWS ABOUT PEOPLE WORKING. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE SO COMPELLED BY SHOWS ABOUT PEOPLE WORKING. > > PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED BY CHARACTERS THAT ARE COMPETENT. THE PHARISEES WAS REALLY ABOUT INCOMPETENCE IN SOME WAYS -- THE FIRST SEASON WAS REALLY ABOUT INCOMPETENCE IN SOME WAYS. BECOMING THE MASTER OF THEIR OWN UNIVERSE IS SATISFYING AN INTERESTING. SEEING SMART PEOPLE BEHAVE SMARTLY IN A WORKING ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY ARE NOT USED TO. PEOPLE LIKE WORKING IN A BLACK BOX AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR THE INDUSTRY. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE SEEING UNDER THE HOOD A LITTLE BIT. > > THE PIT IS COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT. THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF INDUSTRY. THE POLITICS OF AIR I -- ARE VERY DIFFERENT BUT EXPERTS DOING EXPERT THINGS VERY QUICKLY ENGAGES YOUR BRAIN SOMEHOW. SCARLET: THE HYPER CONFIDENCE AND THE VELOCITY OF IT. YOU RELY ON CONSULTANTS TO HELP YOU GET THERE. IN THE FIRST SEASON YOU HAD WALL STREET GUYS HELPING YOU WITH JARGON. YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE HE USED TO WORK ON GLOBAL WALL STREET YOURSELVES. HOW HAS THAT EVOLVED AS YOUR SHOW HAS EMBRACED BIGGER WORLDS LIKE POLITICS AND MEDIA? > > THIS SHOW IS A REFLECTION OF WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN AT THE TIME AND IT'S A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SHOW. IT IS NOT DEALING WITH THE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD. WE RELY ON GOOD CONSULTANTS. WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE IN FINANCE AND PEOPLE THAT WORK IN POLITICS. THE SHOW HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR AND PEOPLE ARE GRAVITATING TOWARDS IT MORE. PEOPLE WANT TO WORK ON IT. SOMETIMES THEY ARE QUITE WELL-KNOWN, INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE WHO WANT THEIR NAMES ALL FIT BUT THEY ARE HELPFUL. > > REALITY IS A FORM OF FICTION. IF YOU TALK TO THEM FOR 10 MINUTES, SOME OF THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE WAY THEY LOOK AT THE THINGS WE ARE WRITING ABOUT IS FAR MORE INTERESTING AND FAR MORE DRAMATIC THAN THE STUFF YOU CAN JUST COOK UP THINKING ABOUT IT. SCARLET: YOU INTRODUCED NEW CHARACTERS THIS SEASON. THEY ALL PLAY AMERICANS ON THE SHOW WHICH I NOTICED IS INTERESTING EVEN THOUGH MAX'S ENGLISH. WHY DO YOU PUT A FOCUS ON AMERICANS IN LONDON? FOR PURELY COMMERCIAL REASONS? > > THAT IS PART OF IT. THE SHOW STARTED AS AN EXPLORATION OF OUTSIDERS COMING INTO THE INSIDE WORLD. IT WAS ENCAPSULATED BY A BLACK AMERICAN WOMAN COMING TO THE WHITE BRITISH CLASS THE SYSTEM. -- BASE SYSTEM. IT IS ULTIMATELY AN AMERICAN SHOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS WRITTEN BY TWO BRITS. FINANCE IS A GLOBAL THING. THERE ARE LOADS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WORKING IN IT AND IT FEELS LIKE THAT MISHMASH OF CULTURES HAS BECOME A SETTING POINT OF THE SHOW IN SOME WAYS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ANYONE IS SAYING. SCARLET: HOW DO YOU GET AROUND THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF JARGON AND ACCENTS AND THE SPEED AND VELOCITY AT WHICH YOU ARE MOVING? > > WE DON'T REALLY GET AROUND IT. ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SHOW AS THEY FIND IT SLIGHTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE. I THINK WE MADE IT SLIGHTLY MORE UNIVERSAL AND EASIER TO FOLLOW. I BELIEVE TURNING TO CLOSED CAPTIONING ON ALLOWS YOU TO FIND THE FINER BITS OF DIALOGUE. SCARLET: I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO THAT. I WONDER HOW MUCH REAL WORLD EVENTS ARE FOLDED INTO THE SHOW. IT IS NOT A DIRECT COMMENTARY OF 2025 WHEN YOU FILMED IN 2024. IT FEELS LIKE THE MOVE AWAY FROM DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A CAST THAT IS DIVERSE IS SOMETHING REFLECTED IN THE CONTENT OF THE SHOW. > > I THINK IT REFLECTS THE SPIRIT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT. IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH THE WORLD WILL BE LIKE IN A YEAR. IT IS SET IN 2026. WE ARE QUITE PRESCIENT SOMETIMES WHEN WE WRITE ABOUT ONLINE SAFETY VERIFICATION AND AROUND THE U.K. IT'S BECOME A BIG THING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. WE TRIED TO REFLECT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REAL WORLD. WE ARE INTERESTED IN POLITICS AND ENTERTAINMENT AND FINANCE. WE TRY TO INJECT THAT INTO WHAT WE DO. > > IT IS NOT LIKE JOURNALISTICALLY RIGOROUS LIKE A WIRE. IT IS SOAPIER THAN THAT. IT'S A HIGH EMOTIONAL SHOW. WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME WORKING ON IT WE CAN'T HELP IT RIGHT BUT WE ARE INTERESTED IN. WE HAVE TO FIND THINGS. THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT INEVITABLY WINDS UP ON THE SHOW. SCARLET: YOU ARE PLANNING FOR SEASON FIVE. WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO SEASON ONE AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE PITCHING A SHOW LIKE THIS TO HBO, HOW HAS THE INDUSTRY CHANGED OVERALL IN TERMS OF HOW YOU THINK YOU CAN GET A SHOW LIKE THIS ON THE AIR NOW? > > THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED TO US ARE VERY DIFFERENT NOW. THE SHOW IS NOT IP DRIVEN. IT'S ORIGINAL CONTENT BY TWO PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING BEFORE. HBO, WHICH IS A BRILLIANT NETWORK, TOOK A CHANCE ON US. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE SAME WAY. PEOPLE ARE GRAVITATING TOWARDS THINGS THEY UNDERSTAND AND HAVE BUILT-IN FAN BASES. THE FACT WE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO EVOLVE THE SHOW EVERY SEASON AND CHANGE THE SHOW PRETTY MUCH FROM THE SLICE OF LIKE YOUNG PERSON SHOW THAT IT WAS TO A CORPORATE FINANCIAL THOROUGHL -- THRILLER IS TESTAMENT TO THE FACT PEOPLE ARE TAKING CHANCES. THERE ARE FEWER CASES OF THAT. SCARLET: THE LAST THING IS THAT SEASON FOUR IS ROLLING OUT WHEN HBO'S PARENT COMPANY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIDDING WAR THAT COULD MAKE A WHERE THE SUNDAY NIGHT TV SERIES OF ITS OWN. WERE YOU EVER ATTEMPTED TO DRAW PARALLELS OR BRING IN THAT KIND OF TENSION INTO YOUR STORYTELLING? > > HBO MADE A SUCCESSFUL SHOW ABOUT THAT ARE READY AND HAS A CABINET FULL OF E-MINIS -- EMMIY'S. IT'S ABOUT TRANSFERS OF POWER. WHO SAYS WE WON'T SEE SOME OF THAT IN SEASON FIVE? DO MIGHT BE SAFER NOT TO. SCARLET: OUR THANKS TO THE CO-CREATORS AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS OF HBO'S \"INDUSTRY.\" THE SEASON FOUR PREMIERE IS SUNDAY NIGHT. LET'S JUST SHOW YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MARKETS. WE HAVE A DIRECTION FOR THE STOCK MARKET. THE S & P 500 IS HIGHER, UP BY .1% AFTER EARLIER DECLINING. YOU ARE SEEING SOME GAINS IN DEFENSE COMPANIES. THERE IS THE ETF THAT TRACKS DEFENSE SHARES UP 5.8% AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO INCREASE MILITARY SPENDING. YIELDS ARE MOVING HIGHER BEFORE THE BIG JOBS REPORT TOMORROW. 10-YEAR YIELD UP TWO BASIS POINTS. THE DECEMBER JOBS REPORT COMING OUT AT 8:30 A.M. THE ECONOMISTS ARE PREDICTING AN INCREASE OF 70,000 FOR THE HEADLINE NUMBER. IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING PAYROLLS, THAT IS CONTINUING TO SEE A DECLINE. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES WE ARE LOOKING FOR A 5000 DROP IN MANUFACTURING PAYROLLS. NEW YORK CRUDE OIL UP BY 2.2%. A LOT OF NEWS FLOW PUSHING OIL AROUND. IT CONTINUES TO HOLD NERO FIVE-YEAR LOW. WE WILL HAND YOU OFF THE BALANCE OF POWER. A LOT TO DISCUSS AS THERE IS MORE JOB STATED THE COME OUT FOLLOWING A STREAM OF PRIVATE DATA JOBS REPORTS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

Lydia Beyoud discusses with Scarlet Fu on \"Bloomberg Markets.\" (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nLydia, thanks for speaking with us. How significant is this that the Trump administration is thinking of putting forward some Democratic nominees for this regulator? Well, it would be really significant. It could be the very first Democratic nominees at an end of any independent agency in this administration. The SEC is also down to just three Republicans. There are no Democrats since the beginning of this year as well. But what we know is that the at least the CFTC seems to be the sort of initial priority for the White House in deciding whether to move forward with a bipartisan slate. And one reason, perhaps that it might be a priority is the CFTC, even though traditionally it regulates the derivatives and swaps market, it's taken on a larger role. It's now contending with crypto and as well prediction markets where we've seen booming growth with cash and poorly market picking up a lot of attention. Talk to us a little bit about, you know, the remit of the CFTC right now, given that it's so understaffed. You're right, Scarlett. The CFTC only has one commissioner that's the the new chairman, Michael Selig, and they are already very busy. Prediction markets have really taken over at that agency. And then with Congress debating whether to move forward with crypto market structure legislation, they could get even more authority to oversee the digital asset market. And in fact, this bipartisan slate that's under consideration plays into that because Democrats have asked for a quorum requirement at both these agencies to be put in place so that there would have to be members of minority party, whoever's in charge in the future. There would always be minority members for any major agency actions, including rulemaking, and that would be very significant. You know, if if the bill passes, if these agencies do get more crypto authority. Yeah, you make a great point. The crypto market structure legislation is something that we're still awaiting. It didn't get through last year. Could it get done before a Democratic nominee is, you know, installed on the CFTC or would it likely be kind of happening at the same time? It's a good question. I think that that really comes down to one, if the White House decides to move forward with bipartisan nominees at all. But, you know, we're expecting a markup in the Senate Banking Committee on their version of that bill next week. In fact, a week from today. You know what happens after that, if that markups even going to be successful and get the bill out of committee, we don't know yet. We'll see. But typically, these nominees do take many months to come through sort of the whole confirmation process once they're even out from the White House. So, you know, it's hard to say where whether those two tracks will align at all.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:32:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:44:49.609917"}

Jonathan Miller, President, CEO and Co-Founder of the real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel, discusses the industry reaction with Scarlet Fu on \"Bloomberg Markets.\" (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nYou and other experts in this space have made the point that institutional investors are not a big player in the single family rental market, yet they make for a convenient scapegoat. Why is that? Well, I think that, you know, they're very much in the public eye, very visible. They only account for about 1% of the single family housing stock. And it's so banning them from purchasing. I think the perception with the public is that they dominate inventory. They they basically, you know, one of the most challenging aspects of housing and why we're in an affordability crisis is because there's been inadequate supply. However, there are very tiny there, you know, a 1% sort of number. And then on top of it, the highest concentration of institutional investors. Wall Street per say, is in the South, the Sunbelt, which has excess supply right now. So it I'm having a hard time connecting the dots on how this will help improve affordability. I think it's a non-issue generally for solving that problem. You make a lot of important points and it's a reminder of how at the end of the day, real estate is very local. Housing supply and housing demand is very local to each specific market. Yet when it comes to perceptions, there is this sense that these institutional investors, Wall Street type of firms like Blackstone play this outsized role. And part of it is because they came in during the financial crisis in the wake of the financial crisis, and did swoop in and buy a lot of single family homes at a time when Americans were losing their homes. So that looms large in the public consciousness. Absolutely. The perception, you know, perception is value. And and so they were, you know, highly visible coming in and sort of, you know, scooping up 2012, 2013, a tremendous volume of foreclosed homes after the financial crisis and have made it work. And some of the firms have even sold off part of their portfolios. As you know, the market has peaked in the last couple of years. So I don't see I see this as this disconnected from what the actual problem is. The problem is to enhance affordability. And I don't think the institutional aspect of the housing market has much to do with it. Right. Well, to be fair, President Trump is not the only one who has suggested something like this. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, has also said something similar. So this is a bipartisan kind of approach to trying to tackle affordability in the housing market. You say the solution is to build more housing, but this that that that takes a long time. That's not something that happens overnight. What kind of timeline are we talking about? Even if you could open the spigot and just allow builders to start building more homes. Yeah. And also, too, you know, a lot of the housing that we're building is skewing to the higher end because of land costs, because of product cost, because of labor costs. All those things make it very difficult. But if you create oversupply or modest oversupply, you place pressure on housing prices and and that sort of melts into the next layer below that and then below that. It is not a sure fire solution, but it's just one of those things. The other thing is, you know, a lot of the challenge of single family affordability has been zoning and cities like Minneapolis have banned single family zoning. New new construction within the municipality and trying to move towards multi-family in high density areas. There's many things that can be done, I think, to your point, that both sides of the aisle are disconnected from the actual problem in this idea that, you know, inventory is inventory is very local, very regional. And when we look at markets like the Northeast or the Midwest, very tight in terms of supply, we look at Sunbelt very soft because they were able to create and build more housing during the migration pattern that we saw during COVID, where people left the Northeast and the West Coast to go to more affordable housing.

After months on the sidelines, a flood of businesses spanning the global economy sued in the weeks since the justices signaled skepticism of Trump’s signature trade policy during a Nov. 5 hearing. More than 1,000 corporate entities are now involved in the legal fight, court records show, teeing up an unprecedented struggle over what happens next if the administration loses. Bloomberg News Senior Reporter for Law and Politics Zoe Tillman and Consumer Reporter Jeannette Neumann join Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. They speak with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat is the argument that these companies are making as to why they're owed this money? Right. So the argument that they're making is not a new argument. You know, back in April, there were a handful of lawsuits filed saying that the president simply doesn't have the authority to rely on a 1977 emergency powers law to order these kinds of tariffs. And lower courts repeatedly agreed with the challengers said he doesn't have authority to do this. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, and in the weeks after the court heard arguments on November 5th, we've seen this onslaught of activity in court as companies have come in with their own lawsuits saying, we agree, we don't think it's lawful. And if the Supreme Court strikes this down, we want our money back. Zoe, is this a difficult case? Is it or is it very clear, based on the law that's out there? Well, I mean, we certainly don't know what the Supreme Court is going to do. Key members of the conservative wing had skeptical questions, tough questions for the government during that hearing, which certainly raised some hopes among trade bar among the companies that are paying these duties that they might have a chance of succeeding. But it's a novel use of this law, so there's not a whole lot to guide us in predicting what they're going to do. So, you know, everyone is just in a wait and see posture. And talking to trade lawyers, they were saying, our clients have been asking how do we prepare? And we've been saying, we don't know, but you could file suit in order to try and, you know, line up and be ready if this all comes to pass in your favor. Costco, Goodyear, Dole, fresh fruit, J.Crew, Jeannette, come on in here and talk a little bit about the companies, some of the very familiar names and some of the smaller names, too, that are hopping on this bandwagon. Yeah, there are there are some well-known companies, but there's not that many. Most of the companies that have filed are private companies and kind of small and medium size businesses, which is which is interesting. And I think part of what's really interesting about this story, when we first started looking at it and we started talking about it, I think the general impression kind of last year was that corporate America hadn't done a lot to push back against the tariffs. Right. I mean, companies had talked about it on their earnings calls and said it was going to be a cost, but in terms of were very careful about coming out publicly and saying this is not good eggs. Eggs. Exactly. And some of the large public companies still are very careful. Costco is really the exception. And Zoe's not going to toot her own horn. So I'm going to two earlier for her and that of our other colleague, Jason Kang. But they they broke the news. They were the first ones to report that Costco was filing a lawsuit. I haven't spoken to some companies who said they decided to file a lawsuit because they saw that Costco is doing it. So this does have a bit of a snowball effect. How do we get from several companies filing in December to or sorry, November to nearly a thousand? It's because they say, oh, Costco is doing this. Actually, that means that maybe this is a good legal strategy. So you had a lot of, as we said in the story and a lot of companies jumping on the bandwagon. But, Jeanette, are there risks to doing this because you're going you know, you're speaking out against an administration that has shown that it is willing to be punitive when it comes to opposition? Yeah, I think that is some of the companies that we spoke with did say that they were worried about that. And that's why I think the number that we were the first to report is is so important because there is safety in numbers. Right. If you're if you're one of ten companies filing right, then you could be singled out. Whereas these companies that we spoke with, I spoke with really a smaller bicycle company in California. It's like, okay, yeah, we see that all these companies are filing and there is some safety in numbers. So I think that that that's part of the strategy here. But it's not like the S & P 500 has come out en masse and said, let's go after it. Hey, Zoe, come on back in here. If the Supreme Court declares the tariffs unlawful, then what? Great question. Everyone wants to know the answer to that question. The first thing we'll be looking for in the opinion is what the justices themselves have to say about what's next. Whether they address the question of refunds, who's eligible, whether they kick it back to the lower courts and say, you figure out this mess. There's some precedent for the U.S. Trade Court dealing with a base refund situation, but even that involves something like 4000 claimants. And here we know from court papers, the government has said there are at least 300,000 importers that have paid these contested tariffs as of mid-December. So the scale and scope of a refund process would be massive. Could they could they possibly, from a legal basis, say, all right, this wasn't lawful. But we also understand it's messy to clean up. And so from this day forward, you can't do this, Mr. President. I had this little, little discussion of that during arguments, but not a whole lot of digging into the really practical remedy questions that the rest of the world economy wants to know the answer to. The arguments were very focused on the questions of law, not the questions of reality and what happens next. So it is possible it's on the table. This idea that they could order. Yeah, only forward thinking, forward facing relief. But that would leave some 300,000 companies and counting very upset. Yeah, no, I get that. I want to let Zoe Tilghman go. She's part of the team behind this. But we're going to keep Ginette Newman here, who covers the consumer and works on this. Look, go ahead. I just want to ask in a follow up to that, would companies be okay with that if what are you hearing in terms of the reporting? Do they just want a win and they want the money back? Or would they be like, okay, kind of not great for what happened, but at least we can move forward and no, we don't to deal with it. I think it's probably both. And they want they they I think I think depending on the company. But again, as we said, because a lot of the companies are small and medium sized companies that have tougher, Fred, have filed that. And that's that's the thing. It's like, okay, we haven't seen this massive impact from the tariffs yet. But talking to these companies for this story, what I what I really what I really learned was that, okay, they made it through so far, but they really need these refunds if the if the case is overturned and if they if the tariffs are upheld and they don't get the refunds, then then this next year and the following year are going to be that's when we're going to start to see the real financial and economic impact of the of the tariffs. I want to go back to what you said about talking to some of the leaders of these companies, especially the smaller ones. You mentioned the bicycle company in Northern California. This cycle's a great bike ibis. Yeah, I was going to say you're a psychologist, right? Yes. We actually had a new pamphlet. I had I this mojo in 2006. I had no idea. By the way, this was not planned. It's it's a great, like, independent bike company. Yeah, but you, you you said in the piece that the the company paid $800,000 in tariffs by 2025. I was just wondering, might everybody the president likes to say it's the other countries that are paying this these tariffs. When when you speak to these business owners, are they saying that other countries are paying these tariffs or are they saying that? No. And they are incredibly frustrated that that that people continue to believe that. And for example, with bicycles, part of the issue is to, okay, so $800,000 in additional costs and then they have additional duties that they were that they're already paying right before Trump's new tariffs. So they're paying a lot in terms of duties and tariffs. And they don't they think that if they raise their prices, that demand would really plummet. So it's not like everyone can just raise prices by, you know, a couple of dollars to compensate for these increased increased costs. So it's that's that's why this next year, I think, will be a real turning point in terms of in terms of the tariff costs. Yeah, that's the reality. Right. The longer this goes on, there are smaller businesses who are just you know, you can be pinched for so long before that's exactly it financially a problem that's in a big way. But are these company the whole point of these tariffs are to provide an incentive for companies to make their products in the United States. Let's go with some of the companies that you spoke to. Are they able to move their production to the U.S. and stop importing to avoid these tariffs? Not not that quickly. And even if, for example, just to go back to Avis, they have a manufacturing facility in in the U.S., but they're still getting hammered. And so if they would want to for example, I'm making this up, but if they would want to expand their manufacturing capabilities in in the U.S., how are they going to do that if they don't have the extra money to invest because they're spending so much in terms of paying and paying for the tariffs. So I think they're just really between a rock and a hard place. Yeah. Yeah. And I would imagine for a lot of these companies, I mean, you're dealing with an administration that you I think it's safe to say that you don't want to be on the White House's radar, especially if you're being critical of strategy coming out of the administration. And so for smaller businesses, it just kind of speaks to how much they are feeling squeezed at this point. Right. That they feel like I kind of need to do this. They are feeling squeezed. But but like we were talking about earlier, I think with the safety and numbers issue, now that they're for example, the guy at Avis. Yeah. Cycles said people saw his name in the article and they reached out to him and said, oh, maybe we should actually join the suit. And so, so smaller, smaller companies. And they also have the benefit of not being as big so as to be seen as politically important. So I think there there's there's there's a benefit there that I think that they can start to read more now that there's more companies that are filing right to safety in numbers in this cases. Was there anything like geographically clumped together? Was there any kind of nuances in terms of the companies that were filing the the greatest we saw the greatest number of companies in California and New York. Those are. Obviously population centers. There could be a political read on that, but we just didn't talk to enough like a high enough percentage of the companies to be able to draw any conclusions. There's obviously a lot of manufacturing and importing in both of those states as well. But it was New York and California.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:18:38 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T23:23:57.933773"}

I mean, this is this stretches back to the first Trump administration, this idea of banning tick tock. The question that we have now is what the status of it is, because you had the scoop out just before the holidays about a deal to save. Tick tock. U.S. had been reached. What's the actual status of that now? So what we scooped before the break was that binding agreement had been signed with three managing investors in this new U.S. tick tock entity, the three managing investors being Oracle, which has a long standing relationship already with Tick Tock, as well as Silver Lake and MGM. The the deal is expected to close on January 22nd. The executive order that that basically sets the deadline for that. The divestiture that was supposed to happen is the following day. So if the deal does indeed close on the 22nd and there's still things that need to be worked out according to according to Tick Tock CEO, so too, if the deal does close, we're going to be an entire year later from from when this entire thing was supposed to be settled. So I think that's just an important, important thing to note. Okay. I want to pause on one of the first things that you said, one of these three entities. So we've got Silver Lake, legendary firm based out of Silicon Valley. You've got Oracle. Many also got MGM, which is an Emirati firm. So not necessarily U.S. ownership when it comes to that part of the investment. Is that an issue? That is that is correct. You know, so the whole point of this was like U.S. ownership, which is correct, that they are doing it or that it's an issue. No, it's correct that they're doing it. So they have 15%. Oracle will have 15%. And they'll also Oracle will also have this sort of larger role as the security provider, the security auditor for Tick, which it has actually had that relationship with tick tock for the last several years. And then Silver Lake also will have 15% this all this all complies with the with the this this this is all compliant. However, I think it is notable that the focus is really at least some headlines and at least in the way that the White House has explained this and the way that Tick tock has explained it, that it is going to be majority American investors. And so I think when people see MDX, that is something that jumps out in the other 55% is the the breakdown. I don't have it. Roughly. Roughly. You've got Bytedance will have just under 20%, 19.9%, which is keeping with what was required by the law. And then there are quiz law. The law was the law was passed and signed under former President Joe Biden. Okay. The law took effect right before Trump took office. Trump took office decided that he wanted to not enforce it because he wanted more time to strike up a deal. And then he continued extending the deadline when the law was supposed to be enforced. But if Bytedance still owns some, what's changed? So. So Bytedance was required to own less than 20% under this new arrangement, Bytedance will own 19.9%. And then certain affiliates of bytedance's certain investor flights of Bytedance's will own will own. Like another portion of that I think was a hands off ownership. And is there really to connect even possibly exist to hands off ownership? I think what is what is tripping a lot of people up and what is catching a lot of attention is that Bytedance's going is still going to retain control of really important parts of the business. That likely includes e-commerce, which is Tick Tock shop, which is like this incredibly important, fast growing arm of TikTok advertising. And and then also the big thing, which is sort of the sticking point of this entire thing is the algorithm where Bytedance is going to be leasing a copy of its algorithm to this new US venture. And the new U.S. venture is then going to be responsible theoretically, for making sure that there is no manipulation of this algorithm, making sure that like, you know, overseeing content moderation. And so so so yes, bytedance's ownership stake, technically on paper, it does it does dip below 20% in accordance with the law, but it does like they're in charge of the other The other the other terms of this are you know, the other terms of this are also very important. And Bytedance is absolutely not going to be severing ties with TikTok, U.S. as of as was required by the law. It seems very favorable to Bytedance in the end. You know, I think that I think that many, many, many experts, especially national security experts who've been watching this, believe that China is coming out with a pretty good deal. And that's right. It's also worth noting that China hasn't actually said anything publicly about whether it is on board, though. If, you know, the tick tock CEO put out the memo that he put out, which we wrote the scoop on back in December. We can assume that, you know, wheels are in motion. But I think it's important and I think it's important to note that, yes, China does come out sort of in a in a in a strong position here. I think President Trump has already and will continue casting this as a win for his administration as well, because he was able to he you know, as as as then being able to thread a needle that that Biden was not able to thread. But I do think it's important to focus as well on how how this will benefit China, especially as Bytedance grows there far beyond its own version of TikTok to become this powerhouse. So I'm going to go back to that story in December. So upon closing, the U.S. joint venture will operate as an independent entity that will control data protection, content moderation, algorithm, security in the country. And this was the ACT chief executive saying this and I guess a memo to employees. So. It's not truly independent from China, though, is it? Or is it? I guess that's the question we all still have. It's not independent from Bytedance is what is what I can say about that. And then what's the relationship between Bytedance and China? Well, there's not separation of church and state there. The way that there is here or the way that there used to be. Here are the exact point I will point out. The reason I say that is because the president just said he finished this great meeting with Intel CEO. Let Bhutan. The United States government is proud to be a shareholder of Intel. So, yeah, we're in this different situation. Different world is different. It's a different world. And I think one thing, you know, one thing I've been thinking about is there was language put out by the White House back in September when they announced, you know, sort of announced their version of this deal. And the version that was shared by the TikTok CEO sort of was parallel to that. The White House, in their own words, described doing this arrangement in partnership or sorry, the guarding of tik-tok, the oversight of its algorithm, doing some of this work in partnership with Oracle. What in partnership with Oracle, what that means and the extent to which the U.S. government would be involved is definitely a question. You know, tick tock would emphasize that like that that that, you know, the government is not involved, I think because we have not seen a lot of the actual fine print of the terms. And we only know sort of the broad contours. It does raise a question of, you know, especially when some of the investors are political allies of the president, what that means in terms of potential U.S. government involvement. So just something to think about. Does Oracle sell to China? I know they do a lot of overseas. I'm just curious. I think they do. But it just makes you know what I mean? It's complicated, right? It's complicated. I'm not I'm not sure I know, but I'm just saying, like, it makes me think about the different relationships and where there might be kind of pressure point.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:11:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T23:23:58.464412"}

She tells Romaine Bostick and Katie Greifeld on “The Close” that rent control, 50-year mortgages, and restricting corporate homebuyers will not improve affordability. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nAnd boy, what a start to this year. It was like an earthquake. Yeah, right. Especially when it comes to the real estate market. So clearly, this is a focal point of President Trump. And I have to imagine the Democrats as well. Housing affordability. And before we talk too much about the specific proposals that have arisen in the last 24 hours or so from where you're sitting, what do you think is the key root of the affordability crisis in this nation right now? You know, I think we have to come up with your guest before was talking about it. We need more supply. And so I think we have to have less restrictive zoning, things like the city of. Yes, that Mayor Adams got passed is a great way to start. I think things like rent control is not helpful. A 50 year mortgage is not helpful. I think restricting corporations from buying homes is not going to help. That's two or 3% of the housing stock. It's not going to do much. I think we have to really figure out ways to build more homes so people can there's more supply in the market. So supply and demand is the central nervous system of the housing market. And so these little like talking points that politicians are selling are not helpful, I don't think. Well, you have to imagine that the volume will only increase as we get closer and closer to the midterm elections in November. But when it comes to your point that we need more supply in this country, I think a lot of people would agree with you. Talk to us about the demand side, though. Yeah, I mean, it depends on where you are, right, Because all real estate is so local. We are in New York City, which is a very different market than many parts of the country. So, you know, this market, I mean, the prices have been pretty flat. We had a really good 2025. It was recovering from 2024 was challenging, but much better. More people got into the market and rates do play a part, but not as much as the rest of the country because it's more discretionary. So people pay cash. But when rates come down, you see more buyers get into the market and you see sellers willing to list their homes because they've got a lock in rate of like two or 3%. So they've been holding back. But what if it's at five or maybe six? Then maybe they'll get into the market. And so that's kind of what we've been seeing. Do you think we're going to see more of more inventory in the New York area, at least in the markets that you cover relative to the last couple of sort of spring selling seasons, if you will? I think probably little. You're not going to see anything explosive. Yeah, I do not see that. I see little trickles of more inventory coming in. It's a slow and steady progress, but it's going to take time. We have a new administration, right? We have a new mayor who's in place, who, you know, has all these new plans and policies, and we have to keep the city safe. You know, and studies have shown that freezing the rent, there's decades of evidence that support the fact that that does not help the housing market. In fact, it makes it worse. You know, Obama's like chief economist spoke about this in great detail. And so one of good policies for good, if you're a socialist, Democrat or Republican, good policies to help our city. Do you worry at all? I mean, you deal with a lot of high net worth individuals and there's been a lot of just anecdotal evidence, no real data saying that people are going to flee New York because of some of the potential policies that the new mayor might implement. Have you gotten any sense that there would be any sort of real migration by some of those folks out of the city? There has been a drop of it. Some people have decided that, you know, they may move or they're going to leave. We saw California news today that a lot of people are leaving because of that big tax. But it's still unwritten and it's hard to say if safety starts to falter in New York City, you will see people leaving. Affordability, yes, is important. And that's why Mayor Mamdani won. But Mayor Adams won because of safety. And we have to keep that in the forefront of our minds in a city like New York. We need safe streets and safe subways. Absolutely. And I do want to go back to the point you made, that when it comes to, you know, what we're dealing with when it comes to affordability. In your view, a lot of that might be fixed by less restrictive zoning. But talk to us, too, about, you know, the cost of new building right now, the pure material cost and how that is factoring. Well, see, that's another talking point from sort of the right, you know, this anti-immigration and the tariffs are not helping housing at all because you have people are not showing up to do their jobs on construction sites because of fear. Right. And then these tariffs I read a study today that said the average home is now $11,000 more because of these tariffs. So that is actually hurt the supply and housing. So, again, we need good policies. Forget the labels. Labels stink. You know, we need to have people that come in with good ideas so that we can build and get people into homes. We want first time homebuyers to not be 40 years old, which is what they are today. They should be in their twenties, late twenties or early thirties. We got to get back to better with the home buying. Do you think, though, that the solution to that will be more at the local level rather than at the federal 100%? It's always local. You have to work. It's you know, Mayor Adams got city of yes past because he worked with city council and borough presidents. He had hundreds of meetings and he started that in 2022. That was no easy feat. And here that's that's going to be his legacy and people. We remember him for that. We have to keep that in mind.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:05:30 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T23:23:58.690126"}

{"title": "Solving the Housing Affordability Crisis", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-01-09/solving-the-housing-affordability-crisis-video", "summary": "Elizabeth Bell of Hamilton Lane talks about President Donald Trump's efforts to solve the housing affordability crisis.  (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nI do want to first start off about your reaction yesterday when you heard this proposal. And it is just that by President Trump to limit the ability of investors like yourselves to buy into the single family housing market here in the United States. Yeah. I think that the headlines from yesterday were definitely eye catching for us. The big point is that there is an affordability crisis within the housing sector, within the US. And it's not just the US a phenomenon. This is a global phenomenon. The headlines from yesterday were particularly going after a group of investors. Institutional investors call that any investor that owns more than 100 units. That group is very small in the grand scheme of the ownership. They own less than 1% of the total housing stock. And so when you take a step back, the issue related to affordability is not about that 1% group. It's really a scale issue. And how do we solve the supply side? And so for us, we're very focused on making sure that there's new supply coming online because that's the only way you're going to solve some affordability crisis. I am curious, though, I mean, at the end of the day, and I don't mean to be pedantic, but it's not your job to solve the affordability crisis. It's your job to find investments and make money for your clients. And so I am curious as to whether these types of proposals would lead you and your team to adjust your investment strategy. You know, for us, we're very bullish on the residential sector in general and there's many different ways you can access residential. We are focused on, you know, multifamily for rent side. We are looking to develop, we're looking at market rate, we're looking at affordable housing. And we can also look to bring new supply online, get a great return because there's just not enough supply and there's so much demand. So for us, bringing new stock online, whether it's in the equity position, finding a new development or even on the construction financing side where there's very tight lending standards today, if we can step in there to get more money into the system to build new homes, that's a win win. We can achieve great returns as investors and also help address this issue. Well, Elizabeth, to to ask a little bit more directly on that question, you're, you know, feeling good about residential overall, but you think about some of these policy proposals, some of the crosscurrents here, would that maybe keep you a little bit away from single family homes? There's many different ways you can play the single family home sector. I mean, I think where we stand today, there was a headline yesterday. We're not really sure where the outcome will be. I think for us, we really like the idea of building for rent, which is a different type of product that you are building specific housing units for people to rent. And given the fact that, you know, post GFC mortgage standards became so much more stringent, it has become a very difficult proposition for many families to own a home. And so they are forced renters by going into some of these build to rent type of investments. You really have a large demand pool that once access to housing in safe, affordable, desirable neighborhoods and through this build to rent strategy, you can achieve that. And so I do want to ask a little bit about multi-family homes, because talking about residential overall, clearly, of course, the focus right now is single family homes. But you think about multifamily developments. I'm taking a look at some of your notes. It's an area where you remain bullish. So compare and contrast what you're seeing in multifamily right now versus maybe single family. Yeah, I think with multifamily it is a much more established asset class. So from our perspective, investing in this asset class, you're very certain on the exits, it's a very liquid market and you know, you can be in much more urban settings where the population is denser. And from a real estate perspective, we like that. We like the population density, we like population coming into locations for job growth, places that are desirable for people to live. So we really like multifamily. I think we also find that there is a place in the market for the single family ownership and rental type of environment, but those tend to be more in the suburbs. And there, you know, they may be in a plot of land which is all together where they might be scattered sites. And so the exit on that is not as robust and proven as it has been on the traditional multifamily side. So we need a little bit more toward traditional multifamily, but we like both sectors. Before we let you go, Elizabeth, I do want to get your thoughts on what's going on outside of housing, real estate, and particularly when it comes to the data center space. We've heard from so many investors saying that they're looking at data centers and they think the prices are just too high. Maybe they're willing to sort of buy up land and do a leaseback or something like that, but they don't want to do a real carry of any real properties in that space. Longer term, are you finding similar issues with pricing? It's interesting. I think a lot of the talk as it relates to data centers is around the hyperscale or market. These are massive facilities and they're typically rented to a single tenant. And the ones we would go after are, you know, you're likely suspects that have high credit quality, tech oriented companies. There is a whole different level of data center requirements and almost a supply chain. And a logistics supply chain to get data from those hyperscalers to the end user. And similar to last mile logistics, we see you've got the hyperscalers on the list at the Outer Ring road. But then you have to go through co-location facilities, co-location data centers that ultimately end up at hotel carriers, which are usually in urban settings. And so yes, we like the data center play on the outskirts, but these hyperscalers development yields have compressed and I think it is expensive to buy on a stabilized basis. However, there's a profile of capital that fits very nicely insurance capital, for example. But we're also now looking at those other two layers that get closer to the urban core and that are required from a supply chain perspective to get that data from hyperscale or colocation through their carrier to the end user.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:28:19 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T16:39:53.146014"}

So it seems pretty clear-cut.\n\nDid Trump’s ‘Truth’ move the market? It doesn’t look like the Treasury market paid much attention:\n\nSure, it wasn’t exactly a blockbuster report. Big revisions, a fall in participation and a pick-up in wages all maybe reduced the likelihood of executing a slam-dunk directional Treasury trade on the back of the leak. Still, the report’s release to the wider market has been enough to give the bond market a bit of a fillip.\n\nHow about prediction markets? While it’s not got much depth, Polymarket might’ve offered an easier way to make a quick buck PA. But it doesn’t look like anyone bothered to place a bet here either:\n\nWhether this is a strategy to boost the social media platform’s subscriber base, or execute the knockout blow to economists’ flagging employment prospects, we’ll let you decide.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 17:07:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T17:41:16.076615"}

FUTURES HIGHER. 30 MINUTES UNTIL THE START OF THE CASH TRADE. I MATT MILLER. DANI: AND I'M DANI BURGER. BLOOMBERG \"OPEN INTEREST\" STARTS NOW. WE NOW HAVE FOUR POINT 4% UNEMPLOYMENT AHEAD OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION AS THE MARKET FACES A MACROECONOMIC WILL TAP. DANI: TRUMP AT HOME AND ABROAD. THE PRESIDENT CANCELS A SECOND STRIKE ON VENEZUELA AND PREPARES TO MEET WITH U.S. OIL EXECUTIVES THIS AFTERNOON. MATT: IN AI, POWER ARMS RACE. MAEDA LOCKS UP NUCLEAR ENTRY -- ELECTRICITY SUPPLY, WITH RIO TINTO IN TALKS TO POTENTIALLY BY GLENCORE. DANI: THERE IS A LOT GOING ON TODAY. I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE ENERGY STOCKS, SPECIFICALLY THE NUCLEAR-POWERED ONES. WITH META BECOMING THE BIGGEST HYPERSCALER-BUYER OF NUCLEAR ENERGY. THEY'RE GOING TO BUY SOME FROM VISTRA FROM OKLO. UP BY NEARLY 16.5%. MATT: WE ARE GOING TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY ARE GOING TO END UP PAYING PER GIGAWATT. MORTGAGE STOCKS ARE MOVING AS PRESIDENT TRUMP DEMANDS FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC TO PURCHASE 200 BILLION DOLLARS IN MORTGAGE BONDS TO KEEP INTEREST RATES DOWN. HE IS ESSENTIALLY GOING AROUND THE FED TO DO QUANTITATIVE EASING FROM THE OVAL OFFICE. RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME MORTGAGE STOCKS HERE. ROCKET UP 6%. LOAN DEPOT UP 16%. SOME BIG MOVES IN SOME STOCKS THAT ARE REALLY TIED CLOSELY TO THE NEWS THIS MORNING. DANI: IN BIG MOVES THIS WEEK WITH STOCKS TIED CLOSELY TO THE PRESIDENT. WHETHER IT BE THAT, WHETHER IT BE INTEL OR THE OIL MAJORS. LET'S START WITH PAYROLL DATA. IT CAME IN LESS THAN EXPECTED IN DECEMBER, BUT THE REAL SHOCKER, A LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. LET'S LOOK AT THE DATA WITH MICHAEL MCKEE. MIKE, WHAT DO YOU CONCENTRATE ON FOR THIS REPORT? MIKE: THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE FED IS CONCENTRATING ON. THE MARKETS REACTION IS TO THE NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED, WHICH WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED. 50,000 IN NOVEMBER -- 50,000 AFTER 56,000 IN NOVEMBER. THE NET LOSS FOR THE TWO MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND OCTOBER WAS 68,000. SO, WE END UP WITH A -20 2000 OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD NEWS. PRIVATE PAYROLLS DID NOT GROW AS MUCH AS ANTICIPATED AND AS MUCH AS THE PRIOR MONTH. BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT MUCH GOING ON IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR AS WELL. NOW TO THE JOBLESS NUMBERS. THIS IS WHAT REALLY MATTERED. THIS IS IMPORTANT. IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER IT WAS 4.5%. IT HAD BEEN 4.6% WHEN FIRST RELEASED, BUT THEY APPLIED NEW SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. THAT MOVED DOWN. THE DROP TO 4.4% IS NOT AS BIG AS YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT. BUT IT IS STILL GOOD NEWS BECAUSE WHAT WE END UP WITH IS ON A THREE-DIGIT BASIS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS BELOW 4.4%. 4.3 75%. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT MOVE AND IT DOES TELL YOU THAT THE FED IS NOT GOING TO BE LOWERING INTEREST RATES NEXT MONTH, WHICH IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THE MARKET -- IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE MARKETS HAPPY. THE JOBS THAT WERE GAINED AND LOST IS PRETTY MUCH AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. ANY FACTORING LOST JOBS. TRADE AND TRANSPORT LOST THE MOST. RETAIL DOWN BY 25. ELTON SOCIAL SERVICES AND LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY WHERE THE WINNERS IN DECEMBER. LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY REALLY MADE A BIG COMEBACK. SO, BASICALLY I THINK YOU END UP AT THE END OF THE DAY BY SAYING, NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED. THIS IS NOT OCTOBER WHERE ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT WORKERS FELL OUT, BUT IT IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM NOVEMBER AND IT IS NOT DIFFERENT -- THE STORY IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TELLING. LOW FIRE, LOW HIGHER. MATT: IF YOU STEP BACK, WE OF GEN Z FEEL FOR .4% IS HIGH, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, HISTORY, THIS IS A VERY LOW LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT. AND 3.8% WAGE GROWTH IS NOTHING TO SHAKE A STICK AT. ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT INFLATION AT ONLY 2.6%. MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD LABOR MARKET. MIKE: IT IS A PRETTY GOOD LABOR MARKET. THE FED IS NOT SO MUCH LOOKING AT THE LEVEL BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS LOW. IT WAS THE SPEED AT WHICH IT WAS RISING AND HAD GONE UP FROM 4.2% TO 4.6%. DANI: ONE MONTH DOES NOT MAKE A TREND. MIKE: NOT ONLY DID NOT GO UP AGAIN, IT WENT DOWN. WHETHER IT IS 4.37 5% OR NOT EXACTLY IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT RISING AND IT IS NOT THREATENING TO RISE SIGNIFICANTLY, TO THE POINT WHERE YOU NEED TO PUT A SAFETY NET UNDER THE ECONOMY BY CUTTING RATES MORE. MATT: GREAT TO GET YOU ON THIS HOUR. I'M SURE WE WILL TALK TO YOU AGAIN IN THE NEXT HOUR. MIKE KEY IS OUR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY CORRESPONDENT. WE ARE FOCUSED IN ON THE LABOR MARKET. LATER WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK TO THE U.S. LABOR DEPUTY SECRETARY KEITH SONDERLING ABOUT THESE NUMBERS, WHETHER HE SEES THEM'S -- THEM AS A SUCCESS. THIS AFTERNOON WE HAVE A WHO'S WHO OF OIL EXECUTIVES GATHERING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. NEARLY 20 PEOPLE WILL BE ATTENDING, INCLUDING BOSSES FROM CHEVRON, EXXON, CONOCO, SHELL, AND VALERO. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTING TO PUSH THE COMPANIES TO REVIVE VENEZUELA'S ENERGY SECTOR. > > I WOULD SAY THE INTEREST, U.S. AND IN VENEZUELA, VERY STRONG IN THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY LOOK AHEAD AND SEE THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY GOING UP. OF COURSE GIVEN BY ECONOMIC GROWTH. 2026 COULD BE A BANNER YEAR, BUT ALSO THE ENERGY REQUIRED FOR US TO WIN THE AI ARMS RACE. THERE IS A STRONG INTEREST IN THIS, INVESTING IN THIS WESTERN HEMISPHERE. MATT: JOINING US NOW IS TYLER KENDALL. TYLER, I WONDER WHAT CARROTS THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO DANGLE IN FRONT OF THESE ENERGY EXECUTIVES TO GET THEM TO INVEST IN VENEZUELA? AND I ALSO THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT DOUG BURGUM USED THE TERM \"WESTERN HEMISPHERE,\" BECAUSE HE IS CLEARLY REFERRING TO THE MONROE DOCTRINE. TYLER: RIGHT. THAT IS THE BIGGEST CASH -- QUESTION OF TODAY AS IT IS CLEAR THE WHITE HOUSE IS TURNING UP THE PRESSURE ON OIL COMPANIES AND BANKING ON THEM TO ADVANCE U.S. INTERESTS IN VENEZUELA. IF YOU LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP HE OFTEN SAYS THE COUNTRY HAS TO BE ON MORE SOUND ECONOMIC PUTTING BEFORE THE U.S. CAN EVEN CONSIDER SETTING ANY POTENTIAL DATES FOR ELECTIONS. BUT PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER TELL US THAT BLOOMBERG NEWS THAT OIL EXECUTIVES HAVE ALREADY MADE THE CASE DIRECTLY TO THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY ARE WARY OF THE SCALE, THE SIZE, THE MONEY REQUIRED TO REBUILD VENEZUELA'S OIL INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE FAMILIAR TELL US NOBODY WANTS TO TELL PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOW. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNALED HE WAS IN TOUCH WITH THESE COMPANIES EVEN BEFORE HE GAVE THE GREEN LIGHT FOR THAT MISSION LAST WEEKEND THAT CAPTURED NICOLAS MADURO. THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS BROADLY SUPPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THIS WHITE HOUSE'S DEREGULATION PUSH, BUT IT IS CLEAR THESE COMPANIES HAVE CONCERNS AND ARE GOING TO WANT TO SEE PHYSICAL SECURITY GUARANTEES, BUT ALSO FINANCIAL GUARANTEES WHEN IT COMES TO ANY POTENTIAL INVESTMENT. NOT TO MENTION QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DOMESTIC PRODUCING IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ENERGY PRICES. PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES SAY THE U.S. IS CURRENTLY WORKING WELL AND COOPERATING WITH THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT, AND THAT INCLUDES GIVING ACCESS WHEN IT COMES TO REBUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE, BUT JUST TO UNDERSCORE THE ATTENTION THESE OIL COMPANIES -- THE TENSION THESE OIL COMPANIES ARE FEELING, IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF THESE EXECUTIVES ASKED FOR THE MEETING TO REMAIN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL DOES DISPUTE THAT THAT WAS AN ASK ON THE TABLE, BUT AS OF NOW IT IS ON THE SCHEDULE AS BEING CLOSE TO THE PRESS. > > SO WE WILL HAVE -- DANI: SO, WE WILL HAVE THAT MEETING. IT IS ALSO JOBS DAY. IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT SHOULD WE GET A DECISION ON THE SUPREME COURT ON IEPA WILL BE THE EVENT OF THE DAY. WHAT SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT? WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR AS IT IS POSSIBLE WE WILL GET THAT RULING TODAY? TYLER: THIS WOULD DEFINITELY DOMINATE THE CONVERSATION IN WASHINGTON. THE SUPREME COURT HAS TWO BIG QUESTIONS THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TARIFFS ENACTED UNDER IEPA. THE FIRST IS, DOES HE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INVOKE IEPA FOR TARIFFS? BECAUSE THIS HAS NEVER BEEN USED IN THIS WAY BEFORE. THE AUTHORITY IS TYPICALLY USED TO LEVY SANCTIONS, NOT TARIFFS. IF THE SUPREME COURT DOES DECIDE THE PRESIDENT HAS THAT AUTHORITY, THEN IT HAS TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY USED THE AUTHORITY CORRECTLY. KEEP IN MIND, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INVOKED IEPA TWICE AND HE HAD TO DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. PARTLY OVER FENTANYL CONCERNS, AND ALSO THOSE SO-CALLED RECIPROCAL TARIFFS WHERE THE PRESIDENT CITED PERSISTED TRADE -- PERSISTENT TRADE IMBALANCES. LAST NOVEMBER WE DID HEAR THE JUSTICES CAST SOME DOUBT ON ALL OF THIS. THERE ARE NOT HE HAS THE AUTHORITY AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE NATIONAL EMERGENCIES MET THE LEGAL STANDARD REQUIRED. A LOT TO DIG IN HERE. WE WILL SEE IF IT HAPPENS AT 10:00 A.M. EASTERN. DANI: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF WE GET THAT DECISION YOU AND THE D.C. TEAM WILL BE PART OF THE ONES BREAKING IT DOWN, SO WE WILL LET YOU PREPARE FOR THAT. THAT IS TYLER KENDALL. ENERGY SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT WILL BE JOINING \"BALANCE OF POWER\" AT 5:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME. ELSEWHERE, MET A HAS ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF NUCLEAR DEALS THAT WILL HELP MAKE IT THE BIGGEST BUYER OF NUCLEAR POWER AMONG ITS HYPERSCALER PEERS. WILL, THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY. POTENTIALLY ENOUGH TO POWER 5 MILLION HOMES. WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF THIS DEAL META IS MAKING WITH NUCLEAR ENERGY POWER USERS? > > THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. STARTING OFF THEY ARE GOING TO BE GETTING ENERGY FROM SOME VISTA -- VISTRA POWER PLANTS IN OHIO. THEY'RE GOING TO UPGRADE THOSE PLANTS. THEY ARE GOING TO GET POWER FROM THOSE UPGRADES, AND THEN LOOKING FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD THEY HAVE DEALS WITH TWO ADVANCED NUCLEAR STARTUPS. TERRA AND OKLO. BOTH OF THOSE ARE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY AND META HAS DEALS TO BUY GIGAWATTS OF POWER FROM THOSE. THEY ARE NOT EVEN BUILDING THEM YET. TERRA IS GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD TWO NEW ONES AND MAYBE SIX MORE AFTER THAT. OKLO IS GOING TO BUILD A DOZEN OF THEIR SMALL REACTORS. THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT WILL NOT EVEN COME TO FRUITION FOR YEARS. MATT: IN THIS ARE ALSO COMING YOU KNOW, SMALL, AS YOU MENTIONED. THEY ARE NOT GIGAWATT-POWER PRODUCERS. WHAT DO WE THINK THE FINANCIAL TERMS LOOK LIKE? THEY DIDN'T RELEASE THEM, BUT I RAN AN ANALYSIS WITH MY HANDY CHATGPT, AND IT TELLS ME THE RULE OF THUMB IS ABOUT 600 MILLION DOLLARS PER GIGAWATT PER YEAR. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? WILL: YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO CRUNCH SOME NUMBERS AS WELL FOR A STORY I'M GOING TO BE PUTTING OUT THIS MORNING, BUT, YEAH, THOSE FIGURES COULD BE IN THE BALLPARK. THIS IS A VERY COSTLY DEAL, AND WHAT IS INTERESTING IS, META IS WILLING TO SPEND MONEY FOR NUCLEAR. THEY COULD GET SOLAR AND BATTERIES A LOT FASTER AND IT WOULD BE A LOT CHEAPER, BUT NUCLEAR GIVES THEM A COUPLE OF ADVANTAGES. THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE IS IT RUNS ALL THE TIME. SOLAR DOESN'T, AND THEY REALLY, REALLY WANT THAT CLEAN ENERGY AROUND THE CLOCK. META HAS GOT THIS MASSIVE DATA CENTER PROJECT THAT IT IS WORKING ON IN LOUISIANA, AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE POWERING IT MOSTLY WITH GAS. AND THEY HAVE FACED CRITICISM BECAUSE GAS IS A FOSSIL FUEL, AND, YOU KNOW, SPEWS CARBON EMISSIONS. AND META IS LIKE MANY OF THE TECH COMPANIES, HAS THESE AMBITIOUS CLEAN GOALS, AND WHEN THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG CENTER PROJECT AND WE ARE GOING TO POWER IT WITH GAS PEOPLE GO, REALLY? WHAT ABOUT THOSE GREEN GOALS? SO, THEY HAVE THIS OTHER BIG DATA CENTER PROJECT IN OHIO, AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO GET THIS NUCLEAR POWER. THAT IS HOW META GETS TO SAY, WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO STAY WITHIN OUR CARBON TARGETS. MATT: OF COURSE YOU WANT TO USE WIND, RIGHT? DANI: THE POOR BIRDS. MATT: WILL WADE, THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR STORY ON SPECULATION ON THE FINANCIAL DETAILS, LOOKING AT MICROSOFT PAYING, LIKE, $17 BILLION. YOU KIND OF MAKE COMPARISONS AND WE WILL TRY TO DO THAT. I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT MARKETS, BECAUSE DESPITE THE IDEA THAT THE JOBS NUMBER IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE FED NECESSARILY TO CUT RATES OR PUSH THEM IN THAT DIRECTION FURTHER, WE DO HAVE FUTURES HIGHER. WE DID SEE THE 2-YEAR YIELD SPIKE AS SOON AS THOSE NUMBERS CAME OUT, SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE MARKET IS KIND OF LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION. DANI: THE 2-YEAR YIELD MOVE HAS SUBSIDED. I SHOULD SAY ONLY A 5%-ODD THAT WE WILL GET A CUT. THE MARKET BASICALLY NOT -- BASICALLY SAYING IT IS NOT HAPPENING IN JANUARY. AFTER THAT IT GOES TO 30% AND SOME CUTS ARE PRICED IN THIS YEAR. MATT: IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MOVERS WE ARE WATCHING TODAY, DANI IS HOT ABOUT RIO TINTO. DANI: IT IS A BIG DEAL. A METALS GIANT WOULD BE CREATED. MATT: POTENTIALLY BUYING GLENCORE TO CREATE THE WORLD'S LARGEST MINING COMPANY. DANI: I HAVE A COMPANY YOU ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT. THAT IS GENERAL MOTORS. GM FALLING 2.2% IN THE PREMARKET. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER 6 BILLION DOLLARS IN CHARGES TIED TO CUT BACKS IN ITS EV BATTERY OPERATIONS. A COSTLY TURNAROUND. MATT: FORD HAD A $20 BILLION WRITE DOWN RECENTLY. INTEL IS RISING AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP PRAISED THE CEO FOLLOWING A MEETING THAT THE TWO HAD. LIP APPARENTLY WAS FLATTERING AND THE SHARES ARE UP 2%. DANI: WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS MARKETS, THE ECONOMY, THE FED, THE FASTEST-GROWING ETF. WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THAT WITH RICK RIEDER. STAY WITH US. DANI: JUST OVER 10 MINUTES UNTIL YOUR OPENING BELL. STILL LOOKING AT GAINS. THE 2-YEAR YIELD IS STILL RISING. IT WAS UP HIGHER AFTER THE LATEST JOBS NUMBERS, WHICH CAME OUT JUST UNDER AN HOUR AGO. SOME MIXED MESSAGING COMING. WHERE DO YOU CONCENTRATE? THAT'S BRING IN BLACKROCK'S CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, RICK RIEDER. I'M SURE YOU HAVE BEEN POURING OVER THE NUMBERS. WHAT IS THE CONCENTRATION? IS A GROWTH THAT COMES IN LESS THAN EXPECTED? IS IT REVISIONS FOR OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER? OR AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE NOW JUST AT 4.4%? RICK: I THINK WHAT MIKE MCKEE SAID WAS RIGHT. THE FED TALKED ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. I HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 50,000 JOBS AND THEN THERE WAS THE REVISION DOWN. IF YOU GO THE LAST SIX MONTHS, MOVING AVERAGE, IF YOU TAKE OUT HEALTH CARE JOBS WE ARE RUNNING NEGATIVE JOBS FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS, AWAY FROM HEALTH CARE, WHICH IS NONCYCLICAL. IF YOU LOOK BACK EIGHT MONTHS THE TOTAL IN JOBS IS -213,000 JOBS, NOT OF HEALTH CARE. WHAT I THINK IS GOING ON IS WE HAVE A PRODUCTIVITY REVOLUTION OF EXTRAORDINARY PROPORTION THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY GROWING AT A ROBUST RATE, BUT WE DON'T NEED THE PEOPLE. I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE FOCUSED ON, COULD THIS BE 60,000 JOBS, 70,000 JOBS, 80,000 JOBS? IF YOU GO BACK TO 2021 WE ARE RUNNING 600,000 JOBS. A BIG PULLBACK, BUT THEN IN 2022, 280,000 JOBS. 2023 YOU WERE RUNNING -- SORRY, 200 -- 2024 YOU ARE RUNNING 270,000 JOBS. THIS YEAR YOU ARE RUNNING AT A NUMBER THAT WE JUST SAW, 39,000 WAS IN HEALTH CARE. THE POINT BEING -- AND PART OF WHY THE INTEREST RATE TOOL DOES NOT AFFECT HEALTH AND DOES NOT AFFECT EDUCATION, WHICH WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE JOB MARKET -- MEANING WE ARE SEEING A PRODUCTIVITY REVOLUTION. IT IS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY, AND I THINK THE LABOR DYNAMIC IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT ON THE BACKSIDE OF THAT. MATT: WHERE DO YOU SEE THAT? BECAUSE I WAS JUST LISTENING TO \"ODD LOTS,\" THAT JOE AND TRACY DO. AI HAS ADDED ABOUT 20 BASIS POINTS OF PRODUCTIVITY TO GROWTH, AND THEIR INCOMING EQUITY STRATEGIST SAID OUT OF ALL 500 S & P COMPANIES ONLY SIX HAVE BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY ADDED PRODUCTIVITY FROM AI. I HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME, AND I SEE THE STOCKS SOARING, BUT WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY WITH THESE TOOLS? RICK: JAN IS RIGHT, AS USUAL. I WILL SAY ONE THING. PEOPLE LIKE TO TAKE PRODUCTIVITY AND SAY IT MUST BE AI. AI IS COMING. SO IS ROBOTICS, SO IS AUTOMATION. SO ARE OTHER FORMS OF PRODUCTIVITY. IF YOU GO BACK THE LAST TWO YEARS, LOGISTICS, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, THE CUSTOMER PROCUREMENT, FREIGHT, HOW YOU USE FREIGHT, EFFICIENCY OF HOW YOU MANAGE YOUR INVENTORY, HOW YOU MANAGE YOUR RECEIVABLES, EVERY COMPANY TODAY IS RUNNING -- WHY IS REVENUE GROWTH AT A DECENT PLACE BUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IS EARNINGS GROWTH IS SPECTACULAR? EARNINGS GROWTH IS SPECTACULAR BECAUSE YOU ARE REDUCING YOUR COST INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE YOU HAVE COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS AND YOU ARE USING SOFTWARE. LOUD, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT TOOLS, ETC. I THINK AI IS COMING AND I THINK IT ACCELERATES WHAT IS A PRODUCTIVITY BOOM, BUT I AGREE WITH YOU. TODAY IT IS NOT AI. BY THE WAY, YOU LOOK AT THE M & A CALENDAR, WHICH I THINK WILL CONTINUE TO BE ROBUST, TO SAY THE LEAST. WHY WILL YOU SEE SO MUCH M & A? SOME OF IT YOU HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE REAL. SOME YOU HAVE BUSINESSES TRYING TO CREATE A MOAT AND SOME MORE DATA. SOME OF IT IS SYNERGISTIC. I CAN GROW MY COMPANY, I CAN BUILD SCALE, AND REDUCE MY COST ECOSYSTEM. THAT MEANS FEWER JOBS. I DON'T THINK THE STORY IS AMBIGUOUS. I THINK THE STORY IS QUITE CLEAR. WE HAVE A LABOR DYNAMIC THAT IS TRICKY. BY THE WAY, IT IS A LOWER-SKILLED PROBLEM. IT IS AN URBAN PROBLEM THAT I THINK IS PART OF WHY -- I HAVE BEEN PRETTY ADAMANT I THINK THE FUNDS RATE -- I THINK INTEREST RATES NEED TO BE LOWER BECAUSE I THINK IT IS LOWER-SKILLED. I THINK IT IS LOW INCOME. I THINK IT IS SMALL BUSINESS ON THE BACKSIDE OF WHAT IS A TOUGH DYNAMIC TO DATE. MATT: I WANT TO GET TO THAT, AND I KNOW DANI DOES TOO, IN TERMS OF RATES. I WANT TO GET TO WHAT YOU THINK IN TERMS OF ADDING JOBS. WE HAVE ZERO IMMIGRATION AND ARE CLOSE TO POPULATION DECLINING. WE ARE NOT HAVING KIDS IN THIS COUNTRY. SO, TO ME, FOUR .4% UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU KNOW, IN THAT PICTURE -- ESPECIALLY WITH 3.8% WAGE GROWTH -- THAT LOOKS GOOD. RICK: I THINK IT IS 4.4 PERCENT, TRENDING HIGHER FROM WHERE WE USED TO BE. I WOULD ARGUE IF YOU TOOK A STEP BACK AND SAID, 4.4 PERCENT, IS THAT A CRISIS? UNEQUIVOCAL THAT THAT IS NOT A CRISIS. THE TREND IS A GOOD STORY. NUMBER TWO, WE HAVE A DYNAMIC -- AND PEOPLE SAY IT IS A SUPPLY/DEMAND DYNAMIC. IF YOU LOOK AT THE JEWEL STATED THIS WEEK AROUND JOB OPENINGS AND YOU LOOK AT THE TREND, -- AGAIN, I'M NOT SAYING WE ARE IN A JOBS CRISIS. IF YOU SAID, GOSH, I WANT TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AND I GO BACK TO WHERE JOBS WERE CREATED IN 2022, 2023, 2024, AND THEN YOU SAY, WHERE ARE WE GOING? ARE WE ARE GOING AS A PLACE FOR ME -- A LABOR PERSPECTIVE THAT IS CONCERNING. I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE A BIT ANTICIPATORY. HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR NINE MONTHS, WHERE THE FUNDS RATE WAS AT FOUR AND THREE EIGHTS. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GO THAT FAR. I THINK WE NEED TO GET THE FUNDS RATE DOWN. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT EVERY MONTH ON THIS SHOW AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET THERE BECAUSE THAT IS THE EQUILIBRIUM LATE -- EQUILIBRIUM RATE TODAY. DANI: EVEN IF YOU GET THERE, HOW DOES THIS CHANGE THESE VERY MACRO TRENDS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT? THAT DOESN'T TAINT -- CHANGE THIS PUSH TO PRODUCTIVITY. THAT DOESN'T PUT A CAP ON AI AND MAY BE ITS ABILITY TO REPLACE WORKERS. SO, IF YOU LOWER RATES DOES IT HAVE AS BIG OF AN IMPACT ON THE LABOR MARKET THIS TIME? RICK: THE ANSWER IS, YOU'RE RIGHT. DOES THE FED CREATE JOBS? THE FED HAVE ONE TOOL. THIS ARGUMENT THE FED HAS ONE TOOL -- IT IS NOT JUST THE FED. WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING NEEDS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH FISCAL INITIATIVES. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF NEWS RECENTLY ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET. I THINK THE HOUSING MARKET IS SUCH A PROFOUND DYNAMIC AND PART OF WHAT THAT INFLUENCE IS SO SIGNIFICANT. I DON'T THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE IS THAT CRITICAL. I THINK IT IS LONGER-TERM INTEREST RATES YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOWN. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GET HOUSING MOVING? IF YOU GET HOUSING MOVING YOU GET MORE LABOR MOBILITY. YOU SEE A JOB IN ANOTHER CITY, YOU CAN MOVE. THAT IS IMPORTANT. EVERY HOUSE BUILT IN THIS COUNTRY CREATES 3.1 JOBS. BY THE WAY, IT IS HARD TO AI BUILDING A HOUSE TODAY. THAT CREATES EMPLOYMENT. THEN THERE IS A WHOLE SERIES OF OTHER THINGS AROUND TECHNOLOGY, ETC., THAT I THINK MOST OF IT ON THE FISCAL SIDE -- BUT I AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK THAT IS THE TREND. YOU GO, WHAT IS THE EQUILIBRIUM RATE OF INTEREST RELATIVE TO THAT IF INFLATION BREAKEVENS ARE 2.3% AND INFLATION PROJECTIONS BY U. MICH ARE WELL CONTAINED? MY POINT BEING IS, YES, WE HAVE A PRODUCTIVITY REVOLUTION. I THINK THERE IS A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS THAT CAN AMELIORATE SOME OF WHAT IS A PROBLEM TODAY. MATT: STILL HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, BECAUSE STEPHEN MIRAN WAS ON WITH US YESTERDAY AND SAID THE INFLATION TARGET, THE INFLATION RATE IS WITHIN NOISE OF THE TARGET, WHICH MAKES SENSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN PULLING ON ALL OF THE LEVERS HE HAS TO GET THE HOUSING MARKET MOVING. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. RICK RIEDER IS GOING TO STAY WITH US THROUGH THE RICK RUNS WHAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IS THE FASTEST-GROWING ACTIVELY-MANAGED ETF IN THE WORLD. COMING UP WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK WITH THE DEPUTY LABOR SECRETARY AS WELL. SO, STAY WITH US ON \"OPEN INTEREST.\" ♪ MATT: MOMENTS AWAY FROM THE START OF TRADING, AND IT IS AN EXCITING DAY. I MEAN CHOCK FULL OF NEWS AND MARKET MOVES. THERE IS A TON GOING ON THIS FRIDAY. HAVING SAID THAT, S & P FUTURES ARE ONLY UP .1%, BUT WE ARE NEAR TO AN ALL-TIME RECORD HIGH ON THE S & P AND THE NASDAQ. FUTURES UP .4% ON THE RUSSELL. THERE'S A TON GOING ON. THAT'S TRUE ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AS WELL. IT LOOKS LIKE THE PROFESSIONAL BULL RIDERS ASSOCIATION'S RING THE BELL BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING TO MADISON SQUARE GARDEN THIS WEEKEND. A COUPLE OF STOCKS RELATED, TKO OWNS PVR AND THAT IS UP OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IT LOOKS LIKE BOOT BARN IS A SPONSOR AND, MAINLY DUE TO MY FORMER HOST SONALI BASAK, THEY ARE OF THREE HUNDRED PERCENT IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. YOU HAVE IHERB RINGING THE BELL AT THE NASDAQ. I DON'T THINK IT'S DIGITAL WEED. APPARENTLY IT'S A BUSINESS TIED TO WELLNESS SOMEHOW, BUT I HADN'T HEARD OF IHERB BEFORE. DANI: I HADN'T HEARD OF PROFESSIONAL BULL RIDERS BEFORE. APPARENTLY THERE ONE WHOSE NAME IS SAGE STEEL. I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS AMONG THOSE UP THERE, BUT I WANT TO MEET MR. SAGE STEEL. SOME STOCKS YOU ARE WATCHING THIS MORNING, META HAS AGREED TO A SERIES OF ELECTRICITY DEALS FOR ITS DATA CENTER STACK COULD TOTAL UP TO MORE THAN SIX GIGAWATTS. THAT WOULD POWER THE EQUIVALENT OF 5 MILLION HOMES. ITS NUCLEAR ENERGY ARE AMONG THE ENERGY FIRMS THEY ARE WORKING WITH, SO SHARES ARE UP AS MUCH IS 15.3%. MATT: ABSOLUTELY SOARING. WE HAVE MORTGAGE STOCKS MOVING HIGHER AS PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTS FANNIE AND FREDDIE TO BUY $200 BILLION IN MORTGAGE BONDS TO KEEP INTEREST RATES DOWN. THAT APPLIES PRESSURE TO THE FED -- ESSENTIALLY, HE'S GOING AROUND THE FED AND DOING WHAT SOME CALL OVAL OFFICE QE. WHICH I THINK IS SO FASCINATING. I WAS LIKE, WHO SHOULD WE TALK TO ABOUT THIS? LUCKILY, WE HAVE RICK RIEDER HERE. BLACKROCK'S CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME. THIS IS SO INTERESTING. PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONLY HAS THIS WEEK SAID THAT HE DOESN'T WHAT STEVE SCHWARZMAN BUYING A HOME ANYMORE OR ANY INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS OF HOMES, AT THE SAME TIME I THINK PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA REMINDS US HOMES ARE FOR LIVING, NOT INVESTMENTS. AND YOU HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW DOING OVAL OFFICE QE AND TELLING HIS GUYS AT FANNIE AND FREDDIE TO BUY TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. DOES THIS HELP, RICK, THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT? RICK: I WILL COMMENT ON A SPECIFIC INITIATIVE. THE ONLY THING I WILL SAY, SOMETHING I THINK WE HAVE, I THINK HOUSING IS PIVOTAL. BY THE WAY, I NORMALLY THINK PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE HOW IMPORTANT -- THREE QUARTERS OF THE WEALTH BY PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR HOME. THE WAY YOUNG PEOPLE BUILD WEALTH IS THROUGH THEIR HOME. I WOULD EVEN RELATE IT TO ON FERTILITY RATES, MARRIAGE RATES, ETC.. I THINK HOUSING RATES, IF YOU HAVE A HOUSING MARKET LIKE TODAY, I THINK THE IMPACT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INTENSE THAN PEOPLE THINK. IN THE OF THE INITIATIVES I THINK TO MOVE IT -- I THINK MOVING THE MORTGAGE RATE IS HELPFUL. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT THAT FAR. WE'VE SEEN -- WE TRACK PREPAYMENTS, BEATS ON MORTGAGES YOU'VE SEEN VERY CLOSELY. IF YOU GET THE MORTGAGE RATE TO 5.5%, 6%, YOU SEE IF THE MORTGAGE RATE COMES DOWN TO YOU CREATE MORE VELOCITY IN TERMS OF HOUSING. WE SEE IT IN EXISTING HOME SALES PICKING UP. I THINK THAT'S THE CASE. IF YOU GET THE MORTGAGE RATE DOWN A BIT. I DON'T EVEN THINK YOU NEED TO GET 10 YEAR TREASURIES DOWN 25, 30, 40 BASIS POINTS. JUST KEEP RATE VOLATILITY DOWN. WITH FOR SCHOOL, I THINK YOU DO SOME PRETTY POSITIVE THINGS, AND I AGREE THAT IT'S ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE COULD DO TODAY. MATT: DOES ANYONE TALK ABOUT GETTING THE FERTILITY RATE UP. WHY AREN'T WE PUTTING CARROTS OUT THERE TO CREATE MARKETS? RICK: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT I'M ACTUALLY BECOMING A GRANDFATHER TODAY. [BOTH]: CONGRATULATIONS! RICK: I HAD MY ANNIVERSARY ON YOUR SHOW MANY YEARS AGO. I THINK ALL OF MY BIG EVENTS COME WITH YOU ALL. MATT: IT IS GOOD FOR US. RICK: THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LINKS AT PLAY AND I THINK IT'S RIGHT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE, 30% OF STUDENT LOANS ARE IN REPAYMENT TODAY. THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING A HARD TIME. IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ITS 8.5%, MAY BE A LITTLE HIGHER. YOUNG PEOPLE GRADUATING, YOU MENTION ONE SURVEY SHOWING PEOPLE GRADUATING COLLEGE, IT'S THE TOUGHEST TIME IN LITERALLY A GENERATION. I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS -- I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS RELATED. A LOT OF THIS IF YOU CREATE INITIATIVE, LIKE THE QUESTION BEFORE THIS, THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO FIGHT AGAINST. BUT I THINK THERE ARE A SERIES OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE THAT WILL IMPROVE A BUNCH OF THINGS. BY THE WAY, THE THING THAT IS CRITICAL, NOMINAL GDP HAS TO BE HIGH BECAUSE WE HAVE A DEBT BURDEN IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS LARGE. IF WE KEEP NOMINAL GDP HIGH AND EMPLOYING MORE PEOPLE, YOU BRING THAT NOMINAL GDP NUMBER UP, WHICH DIFFUSES THE DEBT BURDEN. DANI: IF WE COULD TALK ABOUT YOUR OTHER CHILD, WHICH I REALIZE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN YOUR GRANDCHILD BUT STILL IMPORTANT FOR THESE MARKETS. THE FASTEST-GROWING ACTIVE ETF. IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOME SIZABLE CHANGES IN HISTORY OF ETF'S. MATT: MORE ETF'S THAN STOCKS. DANI: MORE ACTIVE ETF'S, THAT'S A BIG DEAL. YOU WILL HAVE TO POSITION US FOR BIG CHANGES. LOWER RATES, MAY BE CHANGES WITH MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, WHICH I KNOW IS PART OF THIS, MAYBE A TARIFF RULING WHICH COULD ALSO CHANGE WAS THIS BOND MARKET DOES. THIS BRINGS ME TO OF YOUR QUESTION. WHAT IS THE BEST PART OF THE CURVE THAT IS THE BEST PLACE TO INVEST FOR TOTAL RETURN IN 20 26? HOW ARE YOU THINKING INCORPORATING THAT IDEA INTO BANK INTO 2026? RICK: THE PRICES THAT GOES UP, MY JOB IS TO CREATE A BUNCH OF DIVIDEND YIELDS AS MUCH AS INCOME AS POSSIBLE. AN INTERESTING THING THAT PEOPLE SET, WHY IS HE SAYING THE FED RATE MUST COME DOWN, HE MUST HAVE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE. I DON'T WANT INT -- I DON'T WANT INTEREST RATES TO COME DOWN BECAUSE YIELDS ARE PHENOMENAL. WE CAN CREATE 6.2 5%, SIX POINT 5% YIELD AND STAYING HIGH QUALITY. I THINK BANK IS RUNNING A LOW SINGLE-! A RATING. WE REDUCE A LITTLE BIT OF HIGH-YIELD. WE HAVE INCREASED A BIT OF EMERGING MARKETS. WE THINK THE DOLLAR IS CONTAINED. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE SHOW WE LIKE MORTGAGES. QUITE A MOVE TODAY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT AT THESE LEVELS, BUT INCREASE YOUR QUALITY AND YOU CAN STILL RUN YOU THAT IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN A PORTFOLIO AND BE THE LOWBALL. LOOK AT INTEREST RATES AROUND THE WALL, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, AS A DOLLAR INVESTOR IT’'S QUITE ATTRACTIVE. MATT: AS YOU GROW THIS QUICKLY, LOOKING AT THE ERIC BALCHUNAS TWEET, I HAVE TO THINK HE'S THE FOREMOST ETF ANALYST IN THE WORLD. IS IT MORE DIFFICULT AS IT GROWS TO MANAGE, OR IS IT SUCH A HUGE SPACE THAT YOU CAN'T GET THAT BIG? RICK: BY THE WAY, YOU THINK ABOUT IN SIZE, IT IS A FANTASTIC QUESTION. MORTGAGE HAS BECOME MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY ARE SO LIQUID AND THE SIZE OF THE MARKET IS SO EXPENSIVE. YOU DO THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS AS YOU GET LARGER THAT YOU CAN DO IN YOUR PORTFOLIO WHERE WE DO A LITTLE BIT MORE THE SPOKE -- I TEND TO KEEP THIS VERY LIQUID, BUT WE CAN DO A LITTLE MORE THE SPOKE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT. IT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY. BUT THERE ARE SOME MARKETS THAT ARE CLEAR, LIKE YOU THINK ABOUT, HOW BIG DO YOU WANT TO BE IN CERTAIN MARKETS? IT DOES INVOLVE A LITTLE AT SCALE. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT MAKE IT EASIER. BALANCE IS A LITTLE EASIER AT SCALE. BUT YOU DO EVOLVE IT A BIT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE MANAGING, FOR SURE. DANI: HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT POSITIONING HEADING INTO WHAT MIGHT BE A DECISION TODAY ON IEEPA FROM THE SUPREME COURT? IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE COMING IN AND IT'S RULED ILLEGAL, WHAT CHANGES COULD YOU SEE TO THIS CURVE? RICK: IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, AND , FIRST OF ALL, A COUPLE OF THINGS, THIS HAS BEEN OUT THERE FOR A WHILE. WHETHER IT'S TODAY OR WHEN IT COMES OUT, I WILL SAY ONE THING, INCLUDING RECENTLY, WE BUY A LOT OF VOLATILITY IN THE EQUITY MARKET BECAUSE FRANKLY VOLATILITY IS CHEAP AND THE EQUITY MARKET WHEREAS I THINK IT'S HIGH IN THE RATES MARKET. WE BUY A LOT OF VOLATILITY, WE HAVE RECENTLY AS VOLATILITY COMES DOWN. STOCKS GO UP, VOLATILITY COMES DOWN. WE'VE BUILT UP A DECENT AMOUNT OF PROTECTION. I TALKED ABOUT ON YOUR SHOW BEFORE I LIKED THE FRONT TO THE BELLY OF THE YOU CURVE AFTER A NUMBER LIKE THIS AND CHEAPEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT. THE LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE IS NOT THAT INTERESTING BECAUSE THE VOLATILITY GETS YOU. A FEW THINGS AROUND THE EDGES, CAN YOU HOLD A BIT MORE FRONT TO THE BELLY OF THE YIELD CURVE, CAN YOU BUY A BIT MORE VOLATILITY, PROTECTS HIM DOWN -- SOME DOWNSIDE, FIXED INCOME MAY BE GO A LITTLE HIGHER QUALITY FOR THE TIME BEING, WAITING FOR THINGS TO PLAY THROUGH. MATT: WE HAD STEPHEN MIRAN ON, WHO WAS ON \"SURVEILLANCE\" YESTERDAY. HE THINKS THE FED IS STILL 150 BASIS POINTS TOO RESTRICTIVE, ABOUT. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING IN THE DATA THAT COULD PROVE THAT OUT? OR WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE IN THE NEXT PRINTS TO SHOW THE FED IS REALLY BEHIND THE CURVE HERE? RICK: I AM PRETTY RESOLUTE IN MY OPINION. I HAVE BEEN FOR MANY MONTHS. I THINK 3% IS AN NO-BRAINER IN MY MIND. THAT'S AN EQUILIBRIUM RATE. INFLATION BREAKEVENS DON'T TRADE A LOT. I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE GREAT BENCHMARKS. 2.3% STILL ABOVE INFLATION BREAKEVENS. GIVEN WHAT THE LABOR MARKET IS TELLING YOU, GIVEN INFLATION, MOST OF WHAT IS IN INFLATION TODAY IS NONCYCLICAL IN SERVICES. WE TALKED ABOUT SHELTER. YOU CAN ACTUALLY DROP RATE YOU BRING SHELTER DOWN. YOU BRING INFLATION DOWN. THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, INSURANCE, TRASH, ETC. THESE THINGS ARE NOT INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVE. I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO HURT INFLATION BY GETTING THAT FUNDS RATE ANY LOWER BECAUSE SO MUCH OF IT IS NONCYCLICAL IN INFLATION. I THINK THREE IS CERTAINLY A PLACE YOU CAN REST. WHETHER WE HAVE TO GO LOWER, THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS -- IF YOU HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT IS NOT RUNNING 5% NOMINAL AND WE START SLOWING BECAUSE THE FISCAL TAILWIND BECOMES THE HEADWIND, DOES THE NEUTRAL RATE HAVE TO BE CLOSER TO THE TWO? I THINK TIME WILL TELL. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO GO THAT MUCH LOWER TODAY, BUT IF IT WAS ME I WOULD GET THE RATE TO THREE. I WOULD BE FOCUSED ON LONGER ON THE YIELD CURVE, BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE REAL VELOCITY IN THE SYSTEM WORKS. THAT IS WHERE WE ADVANCE MORTGAGES, CREDIT, EVERYTHING IN THE SYSTEM ADVANCES OUT THE CURVE, FIVES, TENS. DANI: A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE YOUR OPINION AND WANT TO KNOW IF IT WILL BE YOU MAKING THAT DECISION? THE TREASURY SECRETARY SAID YOU ARE ONE OF THE SOLE CANDIDATES THAT HAVEN'T HAD THEIR INTERVIEW. MIGHT YOU BE HEADED TO WASHINGTON, D.C. SOON? RICK: YOU ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER. A, I'M FOCUSED ON MY FAMILY SITUATION WE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF -- AND THIS IS THE BUSIEST TIME, QUITE FRANKLY, I'VE EVER SEEN IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE DOING, A LOT OF YEAR END STUFF WE DO, MARKET FUNDS EVOLVING, ETC., ETC. I KNOW IT'S A BAD ANSWER, BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE BUSY. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. DANI: I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE \"OPEN INTEREST\" FAMILY AND WISH A CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY, BLACKROCK'S RICK RIEDER. LET'S GET A CHECK ON YOUR EQUITY MARKET, UP .3% FOR THE S & P 500. THE RUSSELL 2000'S UP MORE THAN 1% EVEN THOUGH WE HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COME TO 4.4% AND WIPE OUT THE CHANCES OF A JANUARY CUT. SMALL CAPS ARE STILL ON FIRE THIS MORNING. MATT: WE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES OF WHATEVER SPECTRUM YOU LIKE -- I WAS LISTENING TO \"SURVEILLANCE\" WITH TOM AND PAUL, YOU HEARD RICK RIEDER, MIKE MCKEE LAID IT OUT -- EVEN THOUGH 4.4% IS LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN, THE TREND IS STILL HIGHER WITH UNEMPLOYMENT. I THINK THE MARKET IS READING 50,000 JOBS ADDED AS LOW. THAT IS WHY WE SAW INITIALLY A SPIKE IN YIELDS. DANI: PROVISIONS, TOO. MATT: IT LOOKS LIKE THE FED COULD, THIS COULD ADD TO THE NARRATIVE THAT THE FED STILL NEEDS TO CUT RATES. DANI: ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NEW FED CHAIR. LET'S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. FOR JOINING US IS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, KEITH SANDERLING. IT FEELS LIKE A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE SET OF DATA. WHAT ARE YOU CONCENTRATING ON AFTER THE RELEASE OF 8:30 A.M. UNEMPLOYMENT? KEITH: THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'M EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT THIS JOBS REPORT BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN HIS CONTINUED POSITIVE JOB GROWTH. IT CAME IN AT 50,000 NEW JOBS, EXACTLY AROUND WHERE THE MARKET WAS PREDICTING. IT SHOWS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ECONOMY IS STRONG. THAT THERE IS JOB CREATION. IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE YEAR AS A WHOLE WE SAW THAT NET JOB GAIN. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE THAT IS BENEFITING AMERICAN WORKERS. THAT IS OUR MISSION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, TO MAKE SURE AMERICANS ARE GETTING IN THE WORKFORCE, GETTING A JOB, AND HAVE THE SKILLS AND TRAINING THEY NEED. DANI: YOU TALKED ABOUT THE NET JOB GROWTH OF LAST YEAR. PAYROLLS CLIMBED 584 THOUSAND. THAT IS THE WEAKEST SINCE 2020. WHEN OF COURSE THEY WERE PLUNGING BECAUSE OF COVID. IF YOU LOOK PAST THE PANDEMIC, YOU DON'T SEE ANNUAL INCREASE OF PAYROLLS THAT LOW THROUGH THE ENTIRE EXPANSION THROUGH 2010-20 19. COULDN'T YOU SAY THAT SURE, JOBS WERE ADDED, BUT IT WASN'T THAT ROBUST? KEITH: JOBS WERE ADDED IN THE RIGHT PLACE. 654,000 IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. NEGATIVE JOB GROWTH IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED. TO RIGHT SIZE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, TO GET JOBS BACK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. ESPECIALLY WITH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES COMING DOWN AND WE JUST GOING UP, THAT'S TO METRIC WE'RE LOOKING AT AND WHAT WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE FROM THIS REPORT, AND SO IS THE MARKET. MATT: MANUFACTURING JOBS, WE LOST ALMOST 100,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS IN 2025, AND THIS IS A SECTOR THAT I THINK THE PRESIDENT IT'S VERY FOCUSED ON. HE WANTS TO BRING MANUFACTURING BACK TO THESE SHORES. WHY DO WE HAVE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A MANUFACTURING RECESSION A YEAR INTO HIS TERM? DANI: LOOK -- KEITH: LOOK, WE ARE EXPECTING SIGNIFICANT MANUFACTURING JOBS, SIGNIFICANT RESHORING, AND HERE BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES, BRINGING FOREIGN DOLLARS, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THIS COUNTRY, WHICH WE WILL SEE THIS YEAR REALLY COME TO FRUITION. GROUNDBREAKING'S OF FACTORIES. AS I TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'M SEEING ENTHUSIASM FOR THOSE JOBS COMING BACK. FIRST, INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS HAVE TO BE MADE. WE ARE SEEING THAT. COMPANIES ARE EXCITED TO HIRE AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUILT IN AMERICA, SECTORS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM HERE. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON AT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, FOR EACH OF THOSE, WHETHER IT IS FIRST CONSTRUCTION, MANUFACTURING, FOR EACH SECTOR COMING BACK WE WANT TO HAVE A SKILLED AMERICAN WORKFORCE, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON WITH HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN SKILLS TRAITS, APPRENTICESHIPS, WORKFORCE GRANTS, BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE JOBS ARE COMING BACK, IT IS JUST THOSE INVESTMENT DOLLARS ARE COMING IN, AND WE WILL SEE A BOOM IN CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING THIS YEAR. DANI: TO UNDERLINE THAT POINT WE DIDN'T SEE THAT LAST YEAR LOSING JOBS. WE DID SEE JOBS ADDED TO THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE, NUDGING UP BY JUST 2000 ROLES. IS THE DOGE EFFECT OVER AND ARE WE SWITCHING TO NET HIRING? KEITH: FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WITH THE VOLUNTARY RESIGNATIONS, PEOPLE LEAVING, WE SAW HUGE DECREASES AT CERTAIN POINTS. FROM ACROSS 2025, WHICH IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT PROMISED, TO RIGHT SIZE THE GOVERNMENT, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. AT THE END OF THE YEAR THAT NUMBER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE A FULL FUNCTION, WHICH THEY CAN, WITH THE RIGHT WORKFORCE. THAT'S WHAT WE SELL FROM THE OVERALL JOB NUMBERS FROM LAST YEAR AND THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE. THAT'S WHAT WE SAW FROM THE OVERALL JOB NUMBERS FROM LAST YEAR IN THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE. MATT: THE OVERALL NARRATIVE THAT THE ECONOMY IS HOT, WE ARE ADDING JOBS, EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC, DO WE REALLY NEED THE FED TO CUT RATES? IN THAT CASE THEY DON'T SEEM TOO RESTRICTIVE? HOW DO YOU SQUARE THAT CIRCLE? KEITH: THAT IS UP TO THEM. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR ON WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. INFLATION IS DOWN IN WAGES ARE UP. THAT IS WHAT OUR KEY METRICS ARE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. WE SEE THAT THE GDP GROWTH IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND CONTINUES TO BE BETTER THAN EXPECTED. WHERE THAT IS GOING TO LEAD IS TO MORE JOBS. I PROMISE YOU, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL BE THERE TO SKILL THOSE WORKERS SO AMERICAN WORKERS GET THOSE JOBS. THEY HAVE THE UNDERLYING SKILLS THEY NEED, WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED BEFORE, BUT NOT ANY LONGER BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE JOBS ARE COMING AND WE WANT THOSE JOBS TO GO TO AMERICANS. THAT IS WHAT WE SEE CONSISTENTLY IN THIS JOB REPORT, THIS ADMINISTRATION, NET GAINS IN NATIVE-BORN AMERICAN WORKERS WHICH REVERSES THAT TREND THAT WAS GOING THE OTHER WAY. WE WANT THOSE AMERICANS TO GET THE OPPORTUNITIES AND HAVE THE SKILLS, AND THAT IS OUR COMMITMENT WHEN THOSE JOBS COME. DANI: UNFORTUNATELY, WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE, LABOR DEPUTY SECRETARY KEITH SANDERLING. CHRIS WRIGHT WILL JOIN AFTER ENERGY MEETS WITH THE PRESIDENT. YOU ARE WATCHING \"OPEN INTEREST.\" ♪ DANI: IT IS JOBS FRIDAY AND MAY BE POTENTIALLY TARIFF RULING FRIDAY. THE GROWTH WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED, BUT SO WAS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. YOU ARE GETTING THIS PICTURE WHERE THE S & P 500 GAINS .2%, BUT BOND YIELDS PERK UP TOO. TWO YEAR YIELDS NOW NEAR THE HIGHS OF THE SESSION UP UNDER UP THREE BASIS POINTS. THE SAME GOES FOR THE 10-YEAR YIELD. JOINING US IS THE HEAD OF FIXED INCOME AT ROCKEFELLER ASSET MANAGEMENT. I HAVE TO SAY, TODAY COULD BE A VERY CONSEQUENTIAL DAY FOR THIS BOND MARKET. WE ALREADY HAVE THE JOBS REPORT WHERE YIELDS ARE SENT HIGHER, BUT MAY BE A RULING ON IEEPA. WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THIS MARKET? > > PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA WE ARE FOCUSED NOW, WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET. WE THINK ABOUT TECHNICALS, TECHNICAL FACTORS, SUPPLY AND DEMAND, DRIVING MARKETS. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TO START THE YEAR IS THERE IS A SURGING DEMAND FOR MUNICIPAL ASSETS. CERTAINLY WITHIN THE ETF SPACE AS WELL. THAT DEMAND, ABSENT OVERWHELMING SUPPLY, IS WHAT WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE PERFORMANCE IN OUR MARKET. IT WILL DRIVE TREASURY RATIOS LOWER, IT WILL DRIVE IT WE REALLY REACT TO ANY MATERIAL CHANGES THAT WE MIGHT SEE TODAY, TOMORROW, OR IN THE COMING DAYS. MATT: LOOKING AT MUNIS PERFORMANCE IN 2025, HOW DO YOU EXPECT 20 2026 TO PLAY OUT? ALEX: WHAT AN INTERESTING YEAR FOR PERFORMANCE IN MUNI'S, IF YOU AREN'T DIVING IN EVERY DAY YOU MAY BE MISSED THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT GRADE MUNI'S OUTPERFORMED THE HEIGHT INDEX. A KEY DRIVER OF PERFORMANCE -- RIGHT? YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT THIS OFTEN. A KEY DRIVER OF PERFORMANCE WITHIN FIXED INCOME. WE HEARD THIS EARLIER FROM RICK RIEDER, IS INCOME AND YIELDS. THE YIELD PER BLOOMBERG IS ABOUT 552 TODAY, TAX EXEMPT. THE YIELD ON THE INVESTMENT GRADE INDEX IS CLOSER TO 348, TAX-EXEMPT. IF YOU REALLY DIVE INTO WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIGH-YIELD MUNI'S, RELATIVE TO IG LAST YEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT A COUPLE OF KEY SECTORS, TOBACCOS, OR A HANDFUL -- REALLY ONE VERY STORIED CREDIT, THAT IS THE STORY THERE. PASSIVE MUNI STRATEGIES, PASSIVE MUNI ETF'S, OR THOSE WHO JUST HUGGED THE BENCHMARK IN ACTIVE MANAGEMENT REALLY UNDER PERFORMED. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE STORY NEXT YEAR FOR HIGH-YIELD AND IG, ACTIVE MANAGEMENT IS LIKELY TO WIN AND YOUR RETURNS ARE LIKELY TO LOOK LIKE THE YIELD ON THE BENCHMARK. THAT IS THE SOURCE. THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING IN MUNI'S RELATIVE TO TAXABLE FIXED INCOME FOR U.S. TAXPAYING INVESTORS. DIRECT STARTING TO TALK ABOUT 9% PLUS TAX YIELDS IN THE HIGH-YIELD MUNI SPACE, SO WE THINK IT REALLY BENEFITS INVESTORS TO LEAN INTO THE OPPORTUNITIES. DANI: THAT IS BEEN A BIG TRANSFORMATION OVER THE PAST DECADE OF FINALLY MARKET PARTICIPANTS WANTING TO OWN ACTIVELY MANAGED ETF'S. OBVIOUSLY, THE OUTPERFORMANCE HELPS. WITH THAT DEMAND, IS THERE A RISK THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS DO COME UNGLUED? THAT THERE IS DISCONNECT? THAT THE DEMAND KEEPS SPREADS ARTIFICIALLY TIGHT? ALEX: THAT EXISTS ALREADY WHETHER WE ARE THINKING ABOUT ETF'S OR OPEN END FUNDS. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MINUTES OF MORE MARKET THERE IS NO BETTER HOME FOR ACTIVE MANAGEMENT -- THE MUNICIPAL MARKET, THERE'S NO BETTER HOME FOR ACTIVE MANAGEMENT. NO BITTER HOME FOR ETF'S AND ACTIVE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE WHY ARE TAXPAYING INVESTORS IN COMMUNITIES? WHAT IS THE BEST RAPPER, LIKELY AN ETF. CAN WE THINK ABOUT OUR MARKET IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE. THE RANGE IN SIZE FROM ISSUING A FEW BILLION TO A FEW MILLION. FIVE-10 MILLION. OUR VIEW IS SIMPLE. IN THAT MARKET THERE WILL BE POCKETS WHERE THERE ARE STRESSES, EITHER LARGE ISSUERS OR SMALL ISSUERS. IF YOU ARE ACTIVELY MANAGING YOUR RISK, DISCIPLINE BOTTOM-UP FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS, RELATIVE VALUE OVERLAY, YOU CAN FIND OPPORTUNITIES. THAT ARE AWAY FROM SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES. IF YOU LOOK BEYOND THE INDEX RETURNS INTO THE DISPERSION AMONG MANAGERS, YOU START TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE. THAT IS WHERE I GET TO THE COMMENT AROUND BENCHMARK HUGGING VERSUS SAYING MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO OWN SOME OF THESE LARGE GLOBAL ISSUERS THAT ARE INDEX ELIGIBLE. MAYBE I WANT TO OWN SOMETHING DIFFERENT. MATT: SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR BLOOMBERG LOOKING AT THIS AND I WILL ASK YOU THE COCKTAIL PARTY QUESTION. HOW ARE MUNICIPALITIES DOING? WHICH ARE DOING THE BEST, WHICH ARE PROBLEMATIC? ALEX: IT VARIES ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU WILL HAVE GENERAL OBLIGATION DEBT THAT IS DOING QUITE WELL AT THE STATE LEVEL, BUT IT MAY NOT BE DOING WELL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. YOU WILL HAVE LOCALITIES THAT ARE DOING WELL, BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT. WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR, THERE ARE POCKETS WHERE I WOULD SAY AVOID RISK. SMALL, SINGLE SITE, RURAL HEALTH CARE CENTERS WILL PROBABLY BEAR SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE ARE SEEING UNFOLD OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. YOU CAN LINK TO SOME OF THE LARGER ISSUERS THAT CREDIT FUNDAMENTALS ARE STRONG. THIS IS A MARKET WHERE IT TRULY IS BOTTOM-UP, CREDIT ANALYSIS. NOT IGNORING ANY SECTOR. NOT IGNORING MATT: MATT: BUT BEING TIGHT. GREAT HAVING YOU HERE WITH US, ALEX PETRONE OF ROCKEFELLER ASSET MANAGEMENT. TALKING MUNI'S. MATT: WE ARE 30 MINUTES INTO THE TRADING DAY. WELCOME TO BLOOMBERG \"OPEN INTEREST.\" I'M MATT MILLER. DANI: I'M DANI BURGER. ABOUT HALF AN HOUR INTO THIS TRADING DAY YOU ARE LOOKING AT STOCKS GAINING THE BOND YIELDS ARE GAINING AS WELL. AFTER THE LATEST JOB FIGURE WAS SHOWING MORE GROWTH -- LESS GROWTH THAN WHAT WAS EXPECTED BUT AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 4.4%. WE HAVE CROSSING THE TERMINAL SOME ECONOMIC DATA. MATT: UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SENTIMENT NUMBERS COMING IN RIGHT NOW. A LITTLE BIT STRONGER ON THE HEADLINE THAT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED AND A LITTLE STRONGER THAN THE PRIOR NUMBER AS WELL. WE HAVE MIKE MCKEE, BLOOMBERG'S INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY CORRESPONDENT. SENTIMENT DATA HAS BEEN BAD FOR A LONG TIME, EVEN AS CONSUMERS SPEND A TON OF MONEY. MICHAEL: THIS WAS AN IMPROVEMENT AND IT SHOWS GOOD NEWS. WE ARE FEELING GOOD ABOUT THINGS AND IT'S A COMBINATION THAT GAS PRICES HAVE GONE DOWN A LOT, THE STOCK MARKET CONTINUES TO RISE, AND PEOPLE ARE LESS AFRAID PERHAPS OF LOSING THEIR JOBS SINCE WE ARE NOT SEEING A LOT OF JOB LOSSES. WE ARE NOT SEEING JOB GAINS AS THE NUMBERS SHOWED. 54 UP FROM 52.9. CURRENT CONDITIONS 52 POINT FOUR FROM 50.4. EXPECTATIONS 55 UP FROM 54.6 NOW IT IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE THINK THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. THE FUTURES, 4.2%, NO CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR MONTH FOR THE ONE-YEAR INFLATION FIGURE. THREE POINT 4% UP FROM THREE POINT 2% FOR 5-10. THE FED PAYS MORE ATTENTION TO THE 5-10, BUT IT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT RISE HIGHER. WE SAW IN THE NEW YORK FED'S SURVEY OF CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY THOUGHT INTEREST RATES -- INFLATION, RATHER, WOULD NOT RISE MORE OVER THE 3-5 YEAR RANGE THAT THEY SURVEYED. ALTHOUGH THEY SAW SOME CHANGE IN THE SENTIMENT IN THE 1-YEAR'S. DANI: IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK FOR ECONOMIC DATA AND THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL OF THEM. HOW DO YOU DISTILL IT? MATT: THIS WEEK. NOT THIS DATA POINT. IT SEEMS LIKE THE LEAST IMPORTANT OF ALL OF THEM. DANI: IT CARRIES THE MOST HEFT, THE JOBS REPORT. MATT: THE SENTIMENT. HERE IS UMICH OVER 20 YEARS, WE ARE AS LOW AS WE WERE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND SURELY CONSUMERS AREN'T THAT PESSIMISTIC OR THEY WOULDN'T BE SHOVELING OUT CASH THE WAY THAT THEY ARE. DANI: THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE DISCONNECT. THEY DON'T FEEL GOOD BUT THEY ARE SPENDING MONEY. MICHAEL: RECENCY BIAS PLAYS A ROLE. PEOPLE FORGET HOW MISERABLE THEY WERE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEY GIVE YOU A FEELING OF HOW THEY ARE THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. DANI: BREAKING NEWS, WE WERE WAITING POTENTIALLY FOR A SUPREME COURT DECISION ON TARIFFS. IT APPEARS WE WON'T BE GETTING THAT. THE LATEST HEADLINE CROSSING IS THAT THE SUPREME COURT DOES NOT ISSUE A TRUMP TARIFFS RULING TODAY ON FRIDAY. IT WAS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED. I WANT TO BRING IN OUR OWN ANNMARIE HORDERN WHO HAS BEEN SITTING AND WAITING. I WAS LISTENING TO \"SURVEILLANCE\" ALL MORNING AND HE SAID THIS WOULD BE MORE EXCITING THAN JOBS. WE DIDN'T GET IT. DO WE KNOW WHEN WE MIGHT GET IT IF NOT TODAY? ANNMARIE: WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT OPINION. THAT COMES OUT. MATT: TUESDAY. ANNMARIE: THE SUPREME COURT WILL TELL US WHEN THEY HAVE OPINIONS BUT NOT WHAT OPINIONS THEY WILL RULE ON. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WITHIN THE PAST FEW WEEKS TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE HOPING THAT THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS IEEPA. WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT IT HE SAYS THERE IS A FLEXIBILITY TO IT. IT IS A TOOL THAT IS SWIFT AND POWERFUL. THERE ARE OTHER ROUTES THEY CAN GO WITH BUT IT WOULDN'T GIVE THE EXECUTIVE AS MUCH POWER WHEN IT COMES TO ENACTING TARIFFS. FOR TODAY, I GUESS WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK. THIS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE ON WALL STREET ARE WATCHING, NOT JUST C-SUITE EXECUTIVES. WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE TO LINE UP AND DECIDE IF THEY WILL GO FOR REFUNDS, BUT THE BOND MARKET AND WHAT THIS COULD MEAN FOR TREASURY YIELDS. MATT: NIKE SHARES TURNED NEGATIVE. I WAS GOING TO SAY, WHAT ASSETS DO WE WATCH? BASIC MATERIALS, CONSUMER GOODS. NIKE. URBAN OUTFITTERS. DANI: COSTCO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD REACT TODAY EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET A DECISION? DOES THAT SPEAK TO THE WAY THE SUPREME COURT IS LEANING? MAYBE YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF THE TIMELINE MAKES A DIFFERENCE? ANNMARIE: WE NEED TO KNOW THE DECISION AND THEN WE CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT COMES TO THE MARKETS, BUT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS, ANALYSTS ON \"SURVEILLANCE\" SAY THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER. IN THE END, IT REALLY DOESN'T. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS GOING FORWARD WITH TARIFFS WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM OR NOT. THIS IS THE INSTRUMENT THEY DECIDED TO ENACT TRADE POLICY WITH. IF THEY CAN'T USE IEEPA THE PRESIDENT HAS OTHER TOOLS IN HIS TOOLBOX. THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH HOW HIGH THE TARIFFS CAN BE ENACTED, ISSUES IF THEY NEED TO GO INTO INVESTIGATIONS AND HAVE PROBES, HOW LONG IT TAKES, HOW LONG YOU CAN HAVE THEM BEING USED FOR. SOME TRADE TOOLS YOU CAN ONLY USE FOR 150 DAYS. THERE IS 338, SECTION 232 WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY USING. THERE ARE OTHER TOOLKITS THE PRESIDENT CAN USE. IF YOU ARE A MARKET PARTICIPANT YOU WANT TO KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, BUT THE END GOAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, THE GOAL TO USE TARIFFS, WHETHER IT IS IEEPA OR NOT. MATT: INVESTORS MIGHT BE BETTING ON A REFUND. IF YOU ARE A DOLL MAKER AND YOU ARE ONLY ABLE TO SELL ONE DOLL WHERE PREVIOUSLY YOU WERE SELLING 30 -- KIDS ONLY NEED ONE DOLL AS THE PRESIDENT HAS POINTED OUT -- THAT IS NO GOOD FOR REVENUE. DANI: I GUESS YOU'RE BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE MATTEL IS FALLING 4.5%, BUT WE DON'T HAVE A DECISION. MICHAEL: THE JUMP IN ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE, THE WHITE HOUSE CAN USE TARIFFS AGAIN IF IT WANTS TO. BUT THAT JUST DELAYS THE PROCESS. IT KEEPS THE UNCERTAINTY GOING IN THE ECONOMY, WHICH LEAVES COMPANIES ON THE SIDELINES NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO, WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T HIRE PEOPLE. SO, WE SEE A CONTINUATION OF THIS LOW FIRE, LOW HIRE ECONOMY. ANNMARIE: IF COMPANIES WANT TO GO FOR THIS REIMBURSEMENT, IF YOU HAVE BEEN PAYING TARIFFS COME YOU DON'T AUTOMATICALLY GET THEM IF THE SUPREME COURT DECIDES IEEPA IS ILLEGAL. YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO FILE SUIT WITH THE COURT OF TRADE. SO YOU NEED TO GO TO FILE A SUIT TO LINE UP FOR THE REBATES. WOULD YOU EVEN NEED TO GO FOR REBATE IF YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO PUT ON TARIFFS, JUST IN A DIFFERENT NAME? DANI: PETER SCHEER'S BASE CASE IS THAT A RULING WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO EVEN GET A REBATE. IT WON'T BE STRAIGHTFORWARD. MATT: THERE HAS BEEN AN ARGUMENT THAT REFUNDS WOULD SOMEHOW BE COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, BUT IT SEEMS STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ME. WE'RE TALKING BUT AT LEAST THE 1000 COMPANIES IN THE SUIT, ORGANIZATIONS THAT KEEP METICULOUS RECORDS OF WHAT THEY PAY FOR THINGS. THE SAME IS TRUE OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL. THEY KEEP RECORDS. IT'S ALL DIGITAL. IT'S ALL DOCUMENTED. MICHAEL: THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE 9000 DIFFERENT COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, THAT ARE UNDER THE TARIFF SCHEDULE. YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHICH PRODUCT UNDER WHICH TARIFF SCHEDULE AND WHAT YOU PAID FOR THAT PRODUCT THAT IF IT WAS DISCOUNTED OR NOT, WHEN YOU PAID IT, THERE'S A LOT TO IT. IF THE COURT DECIDES PARTS OF IT ARE ILLEGAL AND PARTS OF IT AREN'T LEGAL, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE ALL THAT OUT. DANI: IT IS SOMETHING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT DURING THE TARIFFS, THE AMOUNT OF FRICTION INTRODUCED. THAT PAPERWORK COME WITH A HEADACHE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TARIFFS APPLY AND WHERE THEY DON'T. ALSO ADDING A LAW ON TOP OF THAT AND JOINING THESE 1000 COMPANIES ADDS TO THAT COMPLEXITY OF THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. ANNMARIE: PLUS THE HEADLINES WE ARE GOING TO GET, LIKELY COME OF NEW MEETINGS GOING ON BETWEEN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER COUNTRIES, IF THEY NEED TO RENEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS. OR POTENTIALLY MOVES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES OR CERTAIN ASSET CLASSES BECAUSE INSTEAD OF GOING COUNTRY BY COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES TO RECIPROCAL TARIFFS, THE PRESIDENT IS THEN GOING TO USE TARIFFS THAT FOCUS ON SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES. THAT IS WHY EVERYONE SAYS THAT WE ARE PAST PEAK TARIFF OF LIBERATION DAY OF APRIL, BUT MAY BE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE BLUE SKIES AHEAD AND CRYSTAL OUTLOOK ON THE TRADE POLICY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IF THE SUPREME COURT STRIKES ON IEEPA. MICHAEL: WITHOUT THE JOBS AND THE SUPREME COURT WE WOULD HAVE DEFINITION FOR PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS BUT WE HAVE STATUS QUO. DANI: WE ARE STILL TRADING. NIKE IS DOWN, CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY, AND BOND YIELDS ARE STILL HIGHER, BUT NOT AS HIGH AS THEY WERE. IT'S ALMOST A MARKET TRADING AS IF TARIFFS ARE STILL ON. ANNMARIE: MARKET TRADING -- AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW BETTER THAN ME BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE FED CANNOT CUT. MATT: IT LOOKS LIKE THE FED CAN CUT GIVEN THOSE NUMBERS, EVEN THOUGH AT THE HEADLINE LEVEL THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE THE LABOR MARKET IS DOING BETTER. THERE ARE SO MANY CONTRADICTIONS TODAY. ANNMARIE IT HAS BEEN GREAT HAVING YOU ON. ANNMARIE HORDERN, OUR CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT. MICHAEL MCKEE, OUR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY CORRESPONDENT. FORMER FED ECONOMIST WHO NOW RUNS MACRO POLICY PERSPECTIVES, THERE ARE SO MANY CONTRADICTIONS, JULIA. ON THE ONE HAND WE ARE AT ALL-TIME HIGHS IN THE STOCK MARKET AS THE PRESIDENT OFTEN POINTS OUT. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE BIG, GROWING GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. THIS HEADACHE REMINDS EVERYONE WHY CLASSICAL LIBERAL SAY THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT LIKE NO GOVERNMENT. HAVEN'T WE GONE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION? JULIA: IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN THE MARKET COME THE LABOR MARKET? MATT: YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION WHO WANTS TO MICROMANAGE EVERY ASPECT OF THE ECONOMY AND CONTROL IT LIKE A CENTRAL -- LIKE BEIJING. JULIA: IT IS QUITE THE CONTRADICTION, ISN’'T IT? IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM, WHICH WE TEND TO THINK OF BEING BUILT ON FREE ENTERPRISE AND LOW REGULATIONS. WE HAVE A MUCH MORE -- MORE OF A MICROMANAGING APPROACH INDUSTRY BY INDUSTRY. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONUNDRUMS IN THE ECONOMIC DATA AND THE ECONOMY AND IN THE POLITICAL BACKDROP THAT WE ARE LIVING IN. SO, WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO READ THROUGH THE TEA LEAVES. THE JOBS REPORT IS THE EPICENTER OF THOSE CONTRADICTIONS, RIGHT? WEAK JOBS GROWTH, BUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL BACK AND IT TO HAVE STABILIZED. THAT TELLS US THAT A SLOWING IN JOB GAINS IS MORE STRUCTURAL THAN CYCLICAL. THAT SHOULD MEAN LOW GROWTH, LOW JOB CREATION, LOW INCOME CREATION, LOW GROWTH, BUT WE'VE HAD THIS PRODUCTIVITY BURST DRIVEN BY THE AI INVESTMENT. YOU KNOW, DOES 2026 HOLD MORE OF THE SAME OR DOES ONE WIN OUT OVER THE OTHER? DO COMPANIES BECOME MORE WILLING TO HIRE OR DOES THE AI FEVER BREAK? ITCOULD GO EITHER WAY . DANI: PERHAPS THERE IS NO COMFORT TODAY THAT WE DIDN'T GET A SUPREME COURT RULING ON IEEPA ON TARIFFS, I'M LOOKING AT THE MARKET MOVES AND IT'S BAFFLING BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE DID GET A RULING THAT PUT TARIFFS IN PLACE. MARKETS HAVE PAIRED MUCH OF THEIR GAINS. DEERE SHARES, MOTEL SHARES, NIKE SHARES ARE FALLING. DISCRETIONARY COMPANIES ARE HAVING A BAD SESSION. I WON'T ASK YOU TO DIVINE WHAT MARKET MOVES TODAY MEAN BECAUSE THIS MOVE IS HAPPENING DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S CORRECT, BUT SHOULD WE GET A DECISION THAT MEANS TARIFFS ARE STILL ON OR IT IS HARDER TO GET REBATES, IS THAT REALLY BAD FOR CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY COMPANIES? IS THAT BAD FOR CONSUMER-SENSITIVE SECTORS OF THIS ECONOMY? OK POTENTIALLY -- JULIA: POTENTIALLY. THIS IS WHERE HE MIGHT SEE AN INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TARIFFS OR LACK OF TARIFFS DECISION IN JOBS REPORT. WHAT THE JOBS REPORT TELLS US IS WHAT WE CALL THE K-SHAPED ECONOMY IS VERY MUCH ALIVE. THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PAYCHECKS BEING CREATED. THE BREAKEVEN RATE OF JOB CREATION REQUIRED TO KEEP THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STEADY IS CLOSE TO ZERO AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL. SO, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET A LOT OF GROWTH IN CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY INCOME. YES, WE HAVE SOME TAX CUTS ON THE DOCKET FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THAT SHOULD PROVIDE A TEMPORARY BOOST. BUT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS AN INCOME GENERATION, BUT FROM THE LABOR MARKET, AS BEING VERY LOW. SO, THE GAINS THAT DROVE THINGS THIS YEAR, WEALTH GAINS DRIVEN BY TECH SECTOR, DRIVEN BY AI INVESTMENT, GROWTH DRIVEN BY AI INVESTMENT THAN CONSUMER SPENDING, YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT KEEP HEADLINE NUMBERS, AGGREGATE NUMBERS LOOKING OK, BUT CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SECTORS ARE STRUGGLING WITH CONSUMERS THAT ARE BUDGET CONSCIOUS, PRICE-SENSITIVE. MEANWHILE, THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE TARIFFS AND REGULATORY INTERVENTIONS AND UNCERTAINTY. SO, IT IS A TOUGH BACKDROP FOR CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SECTORS, I THINK. MATT: I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON STEPHEN MIRAN'S POINT THAT HE MADE ON BLOOMBERG \"SURVEILLANCE\" YESTERDAY. > > WE ARE STILL MATERIALLY ABOVE NEUTRAL IN MY MIND. THERE'S NOT REALLY A REASON TO BE MATERIALLY ABOVE NEUTRAL IS THE LABOR MARKET IS ON A WEAKENING PAT AND UNDERLYING INFLATION IS CLOSER TO TARGET. EVERY MONTH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TAKES UP A LITTLE IN THE INFLATION DATA SEEMS TO BE DOING A LITTLE BETTER. WE ARE RUNNING UNNECESSARY RISKS ON THE LABOR MARKET BY BEING SO RESTRICTIVE. MATT: GIVEN ESPECIALLY YOUR EXPERIENCE SPENDING EIGHT YEARS CONTRIBUTING TO MACROECONOMIC POLICY DECISIONS AT THE FED, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ARGUMENT? IF HE IS RIGHT, THE NEUTRAL RATE IS 225. JULIA: I THINK THE RECENT ROUNDS OF DATA SUGGESTS THAT THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT CHARACTERIZATION OF TRENDS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DIDN'T DRIFT HIGHER OR STATE HIGHER. IT TICKED LOWER. ONE MONTH OF DATA, WE DON'T WANT TO OVERREACT, BUT IF WE LOOK AT Q4, WHICH WE NOW HAVE THE TOTAL LABOR MARKET DATA FOR, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DEFINITELY STABILIZED ON BALANCE. MATT: TO BE FAIR, TODAY WE'VE HAD EVERYONE SAYING THE TREND IS GOING HIGHER, IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. JULIA: IT LOOKS THAT WAY, BUT AT LEAST IT HAS SLOWED DOWN. IT WAS TICKING UP ONE TENT EVERY MONTH OVER THE SUMMER MONTHS. NOW IT HAS STABILIZED AND TICKED LOWER. WE KNOW THE INFLATION DATA FOR NOVEMBER HAD SEVERAL SOURCES OF DOWNWARD BIAS THAT SHOULD REVERSE STARTING NEXT WEEK. SO, WE ARE EXPECTING A .4 ON CORE INFLATION AND SOME PAYBACK IN JANUARY, MORE PAY BACK JANUARY AND IN APRIL. THOSE INFLATION TRENDS MIGHT NOT LOOK QUITE AS FRIENDLY AS THEY DID IN THE MOST RECENT RELEASE, LEAVING THE FED LOOKING AT THE SAME TENSION. THE LABOR MARKET DOES NOT LOOK GREAT FOR SURE, BUT IT'S NOT FALLING APART. MEANWHILE, INFLATION, WE STILL SEEM TO BE STUCK. SORT OF UNCOMFORTABLY ABOVE 2%, CLOSER TO 3% THAN 2% ON THE FED'S PREFERRED METRIC. I DON'T THINK ALL OF THOSE -- SAYING WE ARE DECISIVELY, MEANINGFULLY RESTRICTIVE I THINK IS AN OVERSTATEMENT OF WHAT THE COMBINATION OF DATA AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS ARE TELLING US. ARE WE AT NEUTRAL, CLOSE TO NEUTRAL? WE WILL FIND OUT, BUT I THINK WE ARE MAY BE CLOSER TO NEUTRAL THAN GOVERNOR MIRAN WAS SUGGESTING. DANI: THAT MIGHT BE WHY YOU'RE SEEING WHAT YOU ARE IN THIS BOND MARKET, INCREDIBLY TIGHT RANGE. JULIA, LOOKING AT WHAT THIS DEFICIT MAY OR IS LIKELY TO SEE IF WE GET AN OVERRULING OF IEEPA 'S USE FOR TARIFFS, LESS MONEY COMING IN THERE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO SPEND ANOTHER $500 BILLION ON DEFENSE. THERE WAS A STORY OUT YESTERDAY THAT HE WANTS TO SEND CHECKS TO PEOPLE IN GREENLAND TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THE U.S. SHOULD TAKE IT. HE WANTS TO SEND TARIFF REBATE CHECKS. ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL WILL INCREASE DEFICIT SPENDING. WHY IS THIS NOT MORE OF AN ISSUE FOR THIS MARKET? WHY ARE DEFICITS NOT FRONT OF MINE GIVEN EVERYTHING THE WHITE HOUSE IS DOING. JULIA: THE BOND MARKET IS ON NOTICE FOR SURE. WE ARE STUCK IN THIS RANGE WE ARE NOT GOING TO HEAD LOWER UNLESS THE ECONOMY LOOKS LIKE IT IS UNRAVELING. AND IT DOESN'T RIGHT NOW. SO, THAT KEEPS BOND YIELDS HIGH AND MARKETS ON WATCH FOR, DO ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS MOVE FORWARD AND MATERIALIZE? THE PRESIDENT SAYS A LOT OF THINGS, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WANTS TO BOOST SENTIMENT IN THE SENSE THAT THE ECONOMY ISN'T DOING WELL, WHICH EVEN AFTER THE RISE IN SENTIMENT IT IS VERY LOW. CONSUMERS ARE IN A SOUR MOOD. THE AFFORDABILITY QUESTION IS STILL THE FRONT TOPIC OF CONVERSATION. SO, HE WANTS TO LOOK LIKE HE IS DOING SOMETHING. EACH OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED, TARIFF REBATE CHECK, REBATE CHECK TO GREENLAND, 50% INCREASE IN THE DEFENSE BUDGET, THESE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH CONGRESS. I SUSPECT EXACTLY BECAUSE OF THE DEFICIT MATH, THAT IS A BIG, HEAVY LIFT. YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT TURNING TO THINGS LIKE ORDERING THE GSE'S TO BUY MORTGAGE BONDS, SOMETHING TO SHOW HE IS DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY. I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING, TO YOUR POINT, IS THE FISCAL TRADE-OFFS THE U.S. IS FACING ARE A LOT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE FACED OVER THE LAST 30, 35 YEARS. WHERE WE COULD DO WHATEVER WE WANTED IN TERMS OF DEFICIT SPENDING AND WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RAMIFICATIONS FOR BOND YIELDS. I DON'T THINK WE ARE IN THAT WORLD ANYMORE. SHOULD WE PUSH FORWARD WITH SOME OF THESE FISCAL PLANS, I THINK YOU MIGHT SEE A BOND MARKET REACTION THAT PARTIALLY OFFSET SOME OF THOSE PLANS, OR THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THOSE PLANS ON THE ECONOMY. DANI: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON WHAT HAS BEEN A VERY BUSY START TO THE YEAR. JULIA CORONADO. JOINING US AFTER NO DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT ON IEEPA, PROFESSOR, WE HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN. ANOTHER HANDWRINGING ON WHAT IS HAPPENING. WHAT IS YOUR ASSUMPTION ONCE WE GET A RULING, WHAT THE LIKELY OUTCOME WILL BE? > > IT IS ANYBODY'S GAME WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THE DECISION WILL BE ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE THAT GOES WAY BEYOND THE IMPORTANCE OF TARIFFS. I THINK THE COURT KNOWS THAT AND WE WILL SEE. IT'S ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE THE PRESIDENT'S POWERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE CONGRESS. WE HAVE SEEN SOME INDICATION, LATELY, THAT THE COURT MAY BE WILLING TO BEGIN TO CLIP PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WINGS A TINY BIT. WE HAVE SEEN SOME PUSHBACK IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. EITHER WAY I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO CHANGE WHAT WE SEE AS MOMENTUM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SOMETHING THAT IS VERY INTERESTING AND THE DISCUSSION YOU HAD WITH JULIA DIDN'T PO INT TO. MATT: YOUR COMMENT ON THE HOUSE AND SENATE, WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MUCH PUSHBACK FROM THOSE BODIES, CERTAINLY NOT THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES. YOU WROTE AN THAT SHE WROTE AN ESSAY IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT TARIFFS PER SE BUT THE EXPANSION OF PRESIDENTIAL POWERS OR THE PRESIDENT USING POWER THAT IS NORMALLY THE POWER THAT THE CONGRESS IS GIVEN CONSTITUTIONALLY. DOES THIS SIGNAL A DEEPER INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE? MARY: CERTAINLY AN INSTITUTIONAL -- I WAS GOING TO SAY TURNING POINT. WHERE THIS PRESIDENT IS REALLY TESTING THE DIVISION OF POWERS ACROSS THE BRANCHES. AND I THINK WE ARE HEADED IN A WAY WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE THE SUPREME COURT WAS USING THE SHADOW DOCKET TO EXPAND PRESIDENTIAL POWERS IN WAYS THAT MAYBE SOME OF US THOUGHT WERE AGAINST THE NORM. BUT IN RECENT RULINGS THEY HAVE BEGUN TO CHALLENGE A BIT. AGAIN, IT IS ONLY AT THE EDGES. I THINK THE SENATE'S VOTE ON MILITARY ACTION IN VENEZUELA SHOWED INCREASING QUESTIONING OF THE EXTENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S POWERS. AGAIN, WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE THESE POWERS WERE NOT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CASE. SO, EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET THE DECISION TODAY, WE WILL ALL BE WATCHING VERY CAREFULLY PERHAPS EARLY NEXT WEEK. MATT: THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TRY AND EXPAND PRESIDENTIAL POWERS. THAT'S ONLY NATURAL. THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO SUPREME COURT, BECAUSE THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT REFUSES TO COMMIT TO ANY ETHICAL -- EXPLICIT ETHICAL RULES. THEY DO THESE KINDS OF RELEASES WHERE MAYBE IT COMES TODAY, MAYBE IT DOESN'T, BUT WE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU WHY OR HOW. WHAT I MEANT BY INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE IS A CONGRESSIONAL SURRENDER. THAT ORGANIZATION, THAT BODY HAS ESSENTIALLY GIVEN UP. MARY: YEAH, IT'S FRUSTRATING. I DO SINCE YOUR FRUSTRATION, -- SENSE YOUR FRUSTRATION, BUT A LOT TURNS ON PUBLIC OPINION. I THINK PEOPLE REALLY REACTING TO WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS BEGINS TO INFLUENCE CONGRESS. I THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE HOUSE, SOME HOUSE REPUBLICANS CROSSING THE AISLE TO VOTE FOR SOME CONTINUATION OF THE HEALTH SPENDING SUBSIDIES, SHOWS THERE IS A BELIEF THAT, YEAH, THE MIDTERMS ARE COMING AND PEOPLE ARE SEEING WAYS THAT THE EXPANSION OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER ARE NOT WORKING FOR THEM. DANI: FOR ANYONE JOINING US, I WANT TO POINT OUT THE MARKET MOVES AFTER A LACK OF RULING FROM THE SUPREME COURT. CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY'S BACK TO UNCHANGED. LULULEMON DOWN 3%. DECKER'S .5%. FOR SOME REASON OIL HAS SPIKED MORE THAN 2%. MARY, I WANT TO CONCENTRATE WITH YOU ON COMPANIES. OBVIOUSLY, CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY -- MAYBE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED WE DIDN'T GET ANY TARIFF RELIEF TODAY, BUT ASSUMING YOU GET A DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT THAT IEEPA IS ILLEGAL BUT YOU STILL HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING SOME OF THE REBATES, HOW CONFUSING OF AN ENVIRONMENT IS THIS FROM CORPORATE AMERICA? I'M ASSUMING A SUPREME COURT DECISION DOESN'T RELIEVE ANY OF THE DIFFICULT TIME THEY ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW? MARY: NO, AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER, UNCERTAINTY IS A KILLER. WE HAVE SEEN INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES MAINTAIN A GOOD PACE, BUT HALF OF IT IS IN DATA CENTERS. WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS INVESTMENT IN ACTIVITIES THAT CREATE JOBS. SO, THERE IS THIS TENSION HERE ABOUT CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY AND THE LONG-TERM HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY. IF IEEPA, THIS USE OF IEEPA IS STRUCK DOWN, AS MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE POINTED OUT, THE PRESIDENT HAS MANY OTHER POWERS. MOST LIKELY YOU COULD RELY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON SECTION 122, WHICH WOULD ALLOW HIM TO PUT ACROSS THE BOARD TARIFFS AT 15% FOR 150 DAYS. GIVEN THAT HIS U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE JAMIESON GREER HAS ALREADY TEED UP A BUNCH OF CASES UNDER SECTION 301, COMBAT UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES ABROAD, OR 232, NATIONAL SECURITY CLAUSE, I THINK THEY COULD ROLL THINGS OUT PRETTY QUICKLY OVER THE NEXT 3-5 MONTHS. SO, I THINK FIRMS STILL HAVE THIS UNCERTAINTY, BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY BELIEVE WE ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE TARIFFS ARE HERE TO STAY, THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW HIGH, WHICH PRODUCTS, WHICH COUNTRY. AS JULIA POINTED OUT, ONE OF THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IS HE HAS INTRODUCED THIS ENORMOUS VARIATION. IN THE PAST COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE U.S. TARIFF SCHEDULE AND SAY, OK, WE OPERATE UNDER WTO RULES. IF THERE IS A 3.5% TARIFF ON SOME PARTICULAR GOOD, THAT APPLIES TO ALL COUNTRIES WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH ANTIDUMPING DUTIES. BASICALLY, BY AND LARGE, YOU COULD LOCATE YOUR PLANT WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT TARIFF VARIATION. THE PRESIDENT, IF HE LOSES IEEPA , LOSES SOME OF THOSE POWERS, AN IMPORT SURCHARGE WOULD APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD, WE PRESUME, TO ALL COUNTRIES AND GOODS. SOME OF THAT VARIATION, OR WHAT YOU EARLIER DESCRIBED AS PRESIDENTIAL MICROMANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY, WOULD BE LOST TO HIM. MATT: APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. HOPE YOU CAN COME BACK WHEN AND IF WE GET THIS DECISION. MARY LOVELY, THE PETERSON INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW ON THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT WE DID NOT GET. IF YOU ARE SEEING HEADLINES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN SHOWING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTED UNPUBLISHED JOBS DATA EARLY IN A SOCIAL MEDIA POST. WE WILL FILL YOU IN ON THE HEADLINE WHEN WE COME BACK. THIS IS BLOOMBERG \"OPEN INTEREST.\" ♪ DANI: WANT TO GET TO A BREAKING HEADLINES THAT WE MENTIONED BEFORE THE BREAK, IT APPEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS POSTED YESTERDAY UNPUBLISHED JOBS DATA. AGAIN, IT WAS YESTERDAY ON HIS SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, TRUTH SOCIAL. IT IS A CHART OF JOBS CREATED JANUARY THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. BASICALLY I THINK WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SHOW IS, GOOD FOR US, FEWER GOVERNMENT JOBS AND MORE PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS, BUT I GUESS IF YOU CRUNCH THE NUMBERS YOU COULD HAVE DIVINED THE TOTALITY OF THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF JOBS, REVISIONS PLUS TODAY'S JOBS FIGURES. EVEN IF YOU HAD THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GUESS THE MARKET MOVE BECAUSE THE MARKET MOVED BASED ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN FROM THIS. HE SAID THIS IS EARLY, ADVANCED JOBS INFORMATION. MATT: THE PRESIDENT HAS ACCESS TO THIS DATA. IF HE DECIDES TO SHARE IT ON HIS TRUTH SOCIAL FEED OR ON TWITTER, ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE IN THE MARKET HAS ACCESS TO IT. IT'S INTERESTING, BUT -- ANYONE COULD HAVE TRADED ON IT. DANI: I'M SAYING YOU WOULD HAVE PROBABLY GOTTEN IT WRONG BECAUSE IF YOU CALCULATED IT YOU HAVE SAID THERE ARE LESS JOBS BECAUSE IT TENDS TO REVISIONS, BUT INSTEAD WE HAVE A MARKET SAYING WE AREN'T GOING TO GET A RATE CUT IN JANUARY. MATT: I GUESS THAT IS UP TO DEBATE WHAT THE MARKET IS SAYING BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY GYRATIONS. DANI: IT HAS LIKE 5% ODDS WE WILL GET A CUT IN JANUARY. MATT: TRUE, BUT THE TWO YEAR YIELD SPIKED AND WENT BACK DOWN, FUTURES, CONSUMER STOCKS WHICH ARE AFFECTED NOT AS MUCH BY THE JOBS NUMBER BUT BY THE SUPREME COURT RULING, OR LACK THEREOF. YOU ALSO SEE A SWING THERE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF A RULING. WE WERE EXPECTING A RULING ON TRUMP TARIFFS TODAY ON USING IEEPA FOR THOSE TARIFFS. THE SUPREME COURT SAYS WE WON'T GET IT NOW. POTENTIALLY ON TUESDAY. Q SAW AS A RESULT -- ALSO, THIS IS MAY BE MORE INTERESTING, CONSUMER STOCKS TRADE FAR LOWER FOR A MOMENT AND THEN COME BACK. NORAH MULINDA IS HERE. I COULD UNDERSTAND IF YOU SAID TARIFFS ARE ALLOWED THAT CONSUMER STOCKS WOULD TRADE LOWER, BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD TRADE LOWER IF YOU JUST SAID WE WILL PUT THIS OUT ON TUESDAY INSTEAD OF TODAY. NORAH: INDEXES ARE RECOVERING BUT WE SAW A REACTION FROM A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES. ANY DELAY EQUALS UNCERTAINTY, THAT'S WHAT MY SOURCES ARE TELLING ME. THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE IS REALLY POINTING TO RIGHT NOW. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS, NAMES LIKE MATTEL, NIKE, DEERE, FALLING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT TARIFFS ARE STILL BEING PAID. WE KNOW 150 BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE HAS BEEN PAID THUS FAR. A LOT OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR REFUNDS, A DELAY, UNDERSCORING THE IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET OUT NOW AHEAD OF THE NEWS. DANI: THIS SAYS TO ME, LORD SAVE US ALL WHEN WE ACTUALLY GET A DECISION. THAT IT WILL BE MESSY AND POTENTIALLY FLAWED THE WAY THAT THIS MARKET INITIALLY REACTS TO WHATEVER WE GET FROM THE SUPREME COURT. NORAH: YOU ARE SEEING A KNEE-JERK REACTION. THAT'S WHAT WE SAW EARLIER, NOW FADING A BIT, BUT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. WHERE SHOULD THEY BE ROTATING TO? WHAT IS MOST EXPOSED? INDUSTRIALS, TECH HARDWARE IS IN FOCUSED, RETAIL NAMES, THE TOY MAKERS, THESE ARE ALL AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HIT HARD BY TARIFFS. WE TALKED ABOUT COSTCO. SO MANY NAMES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS TRADE WAR THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND A LOT OF THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES. YOU ARE SEEING INVESTORS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO BEST TO BEST BE IN THIS MOMENT. MATT: I WONDER HOW THE OPPOSITE AFFECTS OUR? HOW TARIFFS ARE AFFECTING EXPORTERS. WE WILL TALK TO SOMEONE WHO EXPORTS SOMETHING VERY DELICIOUS. AS THE SUPREME COURT DEFERS A DECISION ON CHALLENGES TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TARIFFS, UNCERTAINTY IS RIPPLING THROUGH SMALL BUSINESSES. JOINING US IS THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF COBALT'S -- KOBOLD DISTILLERY OUT OF CHICAGO. I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, NOT IN THE TERMS OF TARIFFS ON IMPORTS BECAUSE YOU MAKE SOMETHING HERE AND SELL IT OVERSEAS. THE RESULT OF THESE TARIFFS, MANY OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS HAVE SLEPT TARIFFS ON US AS WELL. AMERICAN WHISKEY IS ONE OF THOSE, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ITEMS. HOW ARE THOSE TARIFFS HITTING YOU? > > YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BEEN HITTING US FOR A WHILE. I WOULD SAY THE ENTIRE LIQUOR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THIS FOR SOME TIME. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN USED TO THE UNCERTAINTY BUT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE UNCERTAINTY. I WOULD SAY THE TARIFFS HAVE DEFINITELY AFFECTED US. THEY HAVE AFFECTED VARIOUS RAW MATERIALS WE MAY BE USING. THERE IS THE OTHER SIDE, EMOTIONAL, CULTURAL ELEMENTS. ONCE ONE OF OUR BRANDS IS OFF-THE-SHELF ABROAD, THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER BRANDS THAT ARE LOCAL TO THOSE COMMUNITIES, THE CRAFT MOVEMENT IS ALIVE AND WELL ALL OVER THE WORLD ON SOME LEVELS. THEY WILL JUMP INTO THOSE SPOTS AND IT IS HARD TO GET BACK ON THE SHELF ONCE YOU ARE OFF. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF BATTLES WE ARE DEALING WITH. DANI: WHISKEY IS INTERESTING DEALING WITH AN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO AGENT THE THING, IT TAKES TIME AND PLANNING. HOW DIFFICULT HAS THIS PERIOD BEEN FOR YOU GIVEN THE TIMING OF IT? > > I WOULD SAY IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR REASONS WILL BEYOND TARIFFS. OBVIOUSLY THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A LOT OF DECREASES IN CONSUMPTION. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE CRAFT COMMUNITY WE WERE INCREASING IN NUMBER ALL ACROSS THE NATION UNTIL AROUND TWO YEARS AGO. THINGS STARTED TO DECLINE. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE A WAY AND FEWER CRAFT DISTILLERIES THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR. I'M SURE IT WILL LOOK WORSE THAN IT DID IN AUGUST WHERE WE HAVE THE LESS DATA FROM THE AMERICAN CRAFT DISTILLERS ASSOCIATION. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THEY LOST OVER 100 CRAFT DISTILLERIES. THIS IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE. I THINK THIS IS A COMBINATION OF THINGS. IF YOU HAVE, FIRST, COVID. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL, BUT MOSTLY VALUE BRANDS. NOT NECESSARILY CRAFT BRANDS THAT MIGHT HAVE A HIGHER PRICE POINT ON THE SHELVES. THEN YOU HAD POST-COVID OTHER ISSUES, DEALING WITH TARIFFS, UNCERTAINTY. AND NOW YOU ARE DEALING WITH A REAL DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION, PARTICULARLY AMONG GEN Z. MATT: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? JACK DANIELS RECENTLY SAID THEY WOULD PUT DISTILLING ON PAUSE. THAT'S THE KIND OF BIG-BOX BRAND THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE ALL STARTED DRINKING A LOT MORE OF IT DURING THE LOCKDOWN. BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE DRINKING LESS? IS IT AFFECTING CRAFT BRANDS AS MUCH AS THE MAJOR LABELS? SONAT: I THINK IT IS AFFECTING CRAFT BRANDS A LOT MORE. IF YOU HAVE A CRAFT BRANDS THAT YOU LIKE YOU BETTER BUY SOME TODAY. CRAFT BRANDS HAVE BEEN CLOSING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WERE IN MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT THESE WERE BUSINESSES THAT WERE NOT JUST MANUFACTURING A PRODUCT, BUT MANUFACTURING A PRODUCT THAT IS ALSO AGRICULTURAL. IT IS HELPING VARIOUS FARMERS IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES. FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT YOU PUT INTO MANUFACTURING IT IS $2.50 BACK INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. THEY ARE TAKING THIS TIME TO MAKE SOME SMART BUSINESS DECISIONS. CLOSING DOWN. I HEARD THAT FACILITY IS PROBABLY GOING TO GET REFURBISHED. I DID NOT HEAR ABOUT LARGE LAYOFFS FROM THAT PARTICULAR FACILITY THAT YOU MENTIONED, BUT WHAT I AM HEARING AND SEEING ARE COMPLETE CLOSURES OF CRAFT DISTILLERIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO, PART OF IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE THE COMPETITION BETWEEN CRAFT BRANDS THAT IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE SO MUCH WHISKEY ON THE MARKET, BECAUSE YOU HAD A LOT OF PRODUCTION OF WHISKEY -- THERE ARE, I BELIEVE, OVER 16 BILLION BARRELS IN KENTUCKY A WHISKEY RIGHT NOW. WITH CONSUMPTION GOING DOWN, IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF THESE INDEPENDENT CRAFT BRANDS, SMALL BRANDS, TO COMPETE. THAT IS GOING TO BE A BIG CHANGE FOR EVERYBODY. MATT: CAN I ASK MAYBE A STUPID QUESTION, BUT THAT IS MY ROLE ON THE SHOW? I HAVE ALSO QUIT DRINKING. IT HAS BEEN LIKE 3.5 YEARS, BUT I LOVE BOURBON AND I TRULY MISS IT. IS THERE ANYWAY TO MAKE AN ALCOHOL-FREE BOURBON THAT TASTES LIKE REALLY GOOD BOURBON? SONAT: I LOVE MAKING REAL BOURBON, SO I WOULD SAY IT IS ALL A MATTER OF TASTE. YOU DO WHAT YOU LIKE. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE IN AN INDUSTRY ABOUT JOY AND FUN. IF YOUR FUN IS DRINKING SOMETHING THAT ISN'T A REAL BOURBON, THAT'S FINE. I WOULD SAY, HOWEVER, IT IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS GROWING AND IT IS ONE THAT IS ALSO AFFECTING DISTILLERS, SMALL OR LARGE, ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DANI: IT'S NOT REAL BOURBON, MATT. MATT: I GET IT. SONAT: WE HAVE STANDARDS TO CALL SOMETHING A BOURBON THANKS TO THE TTB AND THEY REQUIRE THAT THEY ARE MADE IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND IT DOES CONTAIN -- MATT: SO TTB OR THC. DANI: MATT'S FAVORITE ACRONYMS. WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE BEFORE WE DRAG YOU INTO THAT CONVERSATION. WE WILL DISCUSS MORE ON A LACK OF A RULING FROM THE SUPREME COURT AND SOME OF TRUMP'S TRUTH SOCIAL POSTS ON ECONOMIC DATA. YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG \"OPEN INTEREST.\" ♪ MATT: PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTED A CHART ON SOCIAL MEDIA YESTERDAY THAT INCLUDED FIGURES FROM THE YET TO BE RELEASED DECEMBER UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT THAT CAME OUT TODAY. LET'S GET MORE INSIGHT FROM MICHAEL MCKEE, BLOOMBERG'S INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY CORRESPONDENT. I GUESS THE IMPLICATION, WHAT I THOUGHT, WAS, YOU COULD HAVE HAD EARLY INFORMATION ON THE JOBS REPORT. BUT SO COULD ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS THE PRESIDENT'S TRUTH SOCIAL FEED. MICHAEL: YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE TRUTH SOCIAL FEED OR ONE OF THE AGGREGATORS THAT WOULD PUSH IT OUT. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AS IT WERE. MATT: YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION. MICHAEL: AND HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING. IT APPEARS HE WANTED TO BRAG ABOUT JOB CREATION UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION FROM JANUARY TO JANUARY, SO HE POSTED A TOTAL NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED DURING THE YEAR. THE PROBLEM WAS, IT INCLUDED THE FIGURES FOR DECEMBER. DECEMBER'S FIGURES NOT ONLY ADDED TO IT, BUT SUBTRACTED SOME BECAUSE OF THE REVISIONS. YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO PARSE ALL THAT OUT, SO I'M NOT THINKING HE WAS TRYING TO GIVE SOMEBODY AN ADVANCED LOOK SO THEY COULD MAKE MONEY ON IT. IT'S PROBABLY A MESS UP IN TERMS OF THE SECURITY OF IT, BECAUSE THE LIGHTHOUSE GETS THE INFORMATION AT 6:00 P.M. ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE JOBS -- THE WHITE HOUSE GETS THE INFORMATION AT 6:00 P.M. ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE JOBS DATA COMES OUT. NO ONE IN THEORY AS OPPOSED TO COMMENT ON IT UNTIL AN HOUR AFTER IT IS RELEASED. DANI: IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT YOU ARE THE CHIEF IN CLASSIFYING OR UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION. IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SCANNED GIVEN THE DISTORTEDNESS. MICHAEL: IT LOOKED LIKE A CHART THAT THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS CREATED AND GAVE IT TO HIM AND HE TOOK A PICTURE AND OR SOMEONE TOOK A PICTURE AND PUSHED IT OUT FOR HIM. MATT: IF THE PRESIDENT DECIDES HE WANTS TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION, THAT IS HIS PREROGATIVE. DANI: AND IT IS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE SO TRADING ON THAT INFORMATION WOULDN'T BE INSIDER INFORMATION. MICHAEL: IN HIS FIRST TERM THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED SOMETHING ABOUT THE JOBS REPORT EARLIER THAN HE WAS SUPPOSED TO AND THEY BACKED OFF. HOW WE GET THE INTERVIEW WITH THE LABOR DEPARTMENT PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING, THEY SHUT THAT OFF FOR A MONTH OR TWO TO MAKE SURE NOTHING HAPPENED, BUT IT HAPPENED AGAIN. IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, BUT AS YOU POINT OUT, DANI, ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PRESIDENT, WITH THE PRESIDENT DECIDES, -- MATT: RIGHT. DANI: EVEN IF YOU COULD SOMEHOW DIVINE WHAT THE RETRACTIONS TO UNEMPLOYMENT -- WHAT THE NUMBERS WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE MARKET MOVE RIGHT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS LOGICAL HOW THAT UNFOLDS. THANK YOU. THAT WAS BLOOMBERG'S MICHAEL MCKEE. THE TOP STORY WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON IS THE LACK OF A STORY. THE SUPREME COURT DECLINING TO RULE ON CHALLENGES TO TRUMP'S TARIFFS TODAY. WE COULD GET IT TUESDAY, LATER NEXT WEEK. LET'S GET INSIGHT ON WHAT IS NEXT. THIS SENIOR U.S. POLICY ANALYST FOR BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE, EVERY FRIDAY NATHAN BREAKS DOWN KEY EVENTS IN WASHINGTON, HOW POLICY IS SHAPING INDUSTRIES, COMPANIES, AND CATALYSTS TO LOOK OUT FOR. NATHAN, I WAS HOPING I WOULD GET TO LISTEN AND LOOK THIS FRIDAY AND IT WOULD BE ALL ABOUT A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT THE SUPREME COURT RULED. WE HAVE TO WAIT OUT. NATHAN: WE HAD THE POPCORN READY IN THE PANTRY IN D.C. AND NOW IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE OF DAYS, WEEKS, OR LONGER. TWO THINGS WE ARE TELLING OUR CLIENTS TO GIVE AN EYE OUT. FIRST IS THE IDEA OF REFUNDS ARE NOT REFUNDS. WE HAVE BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE ARE GIVING IT A 60% CHANCE THAT SCOTUS FINDS THESE TARIFFS TO BE UNLAWFUL. THE PREDICTION MARKETS EVEN HAVE NORTH OF 70%. THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE GOING TO SEE REFUNDS. AN GENERALLY SECOND THE CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AGENCY PUT OUT A FINAL RULE THAT WOULD REAFFIRM THAT THESE REFUNDS WOULD BE SENT VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSFER. THAT IS INTERESTING TO SEE IF THESE REFUNDS ARE COMING. THE OTHER QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP DO IF THESE TARIFFS ARE DEEMED UNLAWFUL? THERE ARE OTHER THINGS HE CAN DO. SECTION 332, 3 01, THESE ARE INVESTIGATIONS. YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS AS THE SLOW WAY OF PUTTING TARIFFS. GIVEN A PRESIDENT TRUMP WERE TO SAY IN A WEEK OR TWO I WILL LAUNCH THESE INVESTIGATIONS, WE WILL TRY TO REINSTATE THESE TARIFFS, WHEN YOU DO AN INVESTIGATION MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT IS AGAINST A PRODUCT, NOT A COUNTRY, THINK SEMICONDUCTORS NOT CHINA. IT IS DONE IN A WAY THAT IF THESE INVESTIGATIONS WERE TO COME OUT THE SUMMER, WOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP REINSTALL TARIFFS MONTHS BEFORE AN ELECTION WHEN TARIFFS ARE VERY UNPOPULAR WITH THE AMERICAN POPULACE? WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER, BUT IS SOMETHING WE ARE KEEPING IN MIND. MATT: WE ARE WAITING UNTIL TUESDAY. BY THE WAY, THERE ARE OTHER DECISIONS THAT THE SUPREME COURT CAN ISSUE. ONE ON REDISTRICTING, IMPORTANTLY FOR YOU. WHAT DO WE EXPECT THERE? NATHAN: THE REDISTRICTING THING IS CERTAINLY INTERESTING. OBVIOUSLY TEXAS WENT THROUGH ITS REDISTRICTING. IT WAS REPORTED FOR JENNY IS GOING THROUGH REDISTRICTING AS WELL. WE NEED TO SEE WITH THIS -- THAT VIRGINIA IS GOING THROUGH REDISTRICTING AS WELL. WE NEED TO SEE WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DOES. IT IS SORT OF FIGURES THAT THE SUPREME COURT MAY ALLOW THIS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS. THE THING WE ARE TELLING CLIENTS WHEN IT COMES TO REDISTRICTING IS, LOOK, WHEN YOU REDISTRICT, A STATE FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'RE TAKING A DISTRICT, FOR EXAMPLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP ONE FOR NINE POINTS AND YOU ARE DILUTING IT TO SOMETHING PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BY FOUR POINTS. IF YOU GET INTO THE MIDTERMS THINGS ACTUALLY MAY CHANGE IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE VOTE. IF YOU DILUTE THOSE DISTRICTS IT COULD ULTIMATELY BE A WASH. REDISTRICTING MAY NOT HAVE THE IMPACT THAT SOME THINK IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THEIR SEATS. DANI: ONE THING WE WILL DEFINITELY GET AN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA IS A MEETING WITH OIL EXECUTIVES. WHAT KIND OF MEETING DO YOU THINK THESE EXECUTIVES ARE PREPARING FOR? WILL IT BE THE PRESIDENT DEMANDING THEY SPEND MORE MONEY TO HELP RESTART VENEZUELA'S OIL INFRASTRUCTURE? A HELPING HAND? WHAT WILL BE THE CARET O -- THE CARROT OR THE STICK? NATHAN: HE'S EXPECTING THE OIL INDUSTRY TO PUT $100 BILLION OF NEW SPENDING TO GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT KIND OF GUARANTEE DO THEY GET? A FINANCIAL GUARANTEE, SECURITY? THEY PLAYED THE STORY BEFORE. OUR ANALYST HAS A GREAT NOTE ON THE TERMINAL. THE ENTERGY INDUSTRY -- THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WOULD LOVE TO BE IN VENICE WITH A LAST TIME HE DID THIS IN MASS THEY NATIONALIZED IN THE INDUSTRY SUFFERED AS A RESULT. THE COMMON SET OF LOOKING FOR FROM THE SECRETARY INTO THE ENERGY EXECUTIVES COMING AFTER THIS MEETING TONIGHT IS, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO GET IN TERMS OF GUARANTEES? ON THE QUICK ASIDE, IF THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WERE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IN, YOU COULD SEE OIL FLOWING IN 3-5 YEARS, BUT ULTIMATELY ON THE SLOW SIDE THIS COULD TAKE 10-15 YEARS TO GET THE OPERATIONS IN THE COUNTRY GOING. DANI: I THINK THERE ARE LIKE 1000 THINGS WE COULD ASK YOU BUT WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. MATT: WE ARE NOT GOING TO ASK HIM ANY MORE QUESTIONS BECAUSE HE IS NOT WEARING THE VEST. IF YOU ARE WEARING THE FLEECE VEST I WOULD GIVE HIM THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES, BUT AMERICA'S DAD COMES ON WITH THE BLAZER? FORGET ABOUT IT. DANI: IF YOU'RE LISTENING, I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT TO WEAR WHEN YOU ARE NEXT ON THE PROGRAM WITH US. MATT: IT IS A \"BALANCE OF POWER\" INSIDE JOKE. THANK YOU. DANI: MONDAY, WE WILL GET A HOST OF FED SPEAK. TUESDAY, CBI, THAT COMES OUT. THE BIG BANK EARNINGS KICK OFF J.P. MORGAN, REPORTING RESULTS ON TUESDAY. BANK OF AMERICA, WELLS FARGO, CITI ON WEDNESDAY, PLUS PPI AND RETAIL SALES FINALLY ANOTHER ROUND OF RESULTS FOR MORGAN STANLEY AND GOLDMAN SACHS. JOINING US TO GET A PREVIEW OF THOSE EARNINGS IS CHRIS MCGRADY, HEAD OF U.S. BANK RESEARCH AT KBW. CHRIS, IN TERMS OF ALL OF THE BIG BANK RESULTS WE WILL GET NEXT WEEK, WHO DO YOU THINK IS BEST POSITION FOR THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE M & A ANIMAL SPIRITS HAVE COME BACK AND TRADING HAS BEEN VOLATILE? WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE STANDOUT? CHRIS: GOOD MORNING, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK. BROADLY THEY WILL ALL BE WINNERS. THE CAPITAL MARKETS TRADE IS ALIVE AND WELL. Q. ARE SEEING HEALTHY M & A ACTIVITY, -- YOU ARE SEEING HEALTHY M & A ACTIVITY. TRADING VOLUMES REMAIN HEALTHY. YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE LOAN GROWTH. THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD FUNDAMENTALS WHEN WE SEE REPORTS NEXT WEEK. MATT: CHRIS, WHAT ARE THE STANDOUTS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR? WE FOCUS HERE OBVIOUSLY ON M & A, TRADING, OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE THE BIG TV THEMES, BUT WHEN YOU DIG INTO THE NUMBERS, LOOK AT THE BANKS THAT YOU WANT TO BUY OR OWN, WHAT ARE YOU MOST INTERESTED IN? CHRIS: WE THINK TOP LINE, THE REVENUE OUTLOOK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE SEE A LOT OF EXPENSE TALK FROM J.P. MORGAN LAST MONTH. THAT WILL BE A FOCUS. WE WANT TO SEE TOPLINE DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE SEEING IT FROM THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE BANKS HAVE GUIDED. THAT PROBABLY ALLOWED SOME ROOM FOR UPSIDE SURPRISE FOR TRADING AND BANKING, BUT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THE NET INTEREST INCOME GROWTH. WE THINK LOAN GROWTH IS ON THE PRECIPICE OF IMPROVING. FOURTH QUARTER, DATA BY THE FED SUGGESTS AN IMPROVEMENT. MARGINS ARE HOLDING IN. WE WANT TO SEE TOPLINE GROWTH, BUT ULTIMATELY OPERATING LEVERAGE AND GOOD CREDIT IS IMPORTANT. DANI: ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING IN YOUR RESEARCH, BASICALLY SAYING YOU ARE CAUTIOUS ON THE OUTLOOK FOR EQUITY TRADING REVENUES. GIVEN THAT AFTER 2026 THAT WAS UNDERSCORED BY VOLATILITY IN EQUITY TRADING, WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THAT PART OF THE BANKS? WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SOME OF THE BUSINESSES? ARE ANY OF THEM NOT PIVOTED AWAY ENOUGH FROM EQUITIES TRADING REVENUE WHEN IT COMES TO OVERALL REVENUE IN THAT DEPARTMENT? CHRIS: TRADE HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR MANY YEARS. WE HAVE SEEN PERIODS OF VOLATILITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR, GOOD VOLATILITY, ULTIMATELY. WE SAW STRONG RESULTS. IT'S ABOUT THE RATE OF GROWTH FROM HERE. WE DON'T THINK THERE IS A MATERIAL DECLINE IN REVENUE, BUT THE RATE OF GROWTH FOR TRADING WILL LIKELY SLOW AND PROPORTIONATELY TRADING IS A BIGGER PIECE OF THE REVENUES THAT INVESTMENT BANKING, SO THERE'S A HANDOFF IN THE REVENUE OUTLOOK. MATT: IS THERE ANY CONCERN ABOUT COCKROACHES, CHRIS? CHRIS: WHAT IS INTERESTING, SINCE WE LAST TALKED, THERE IS VERY LITTLE INTERACTION WITH CLIENTS ON CREDIT. YOU CAN VIEW THAT AS THE ECONOMY IS RESILIENT, THE CONSUMER IS STRONG, OR WE HAVE BEEN LULLED INTO A SENSE OF COMPLACENCY. I THINK WE ARE VIGILANT. CREDIT EXPECTATIONS LAST QUARTER WERE THE NUMBER ONE THING WE TALKED ABOUT. WE SAW THREE HIGH-PROFILE BANKRUPTCIES THAT PLAGUED THE INDUSTRY. I WOULD SAY WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT NARRATIVE HAS DIED DOWN. IMPORTANTLY, THE BANKS HAVE PASSED THE TESTS SO FAR. THE EARNINGS COME THE ARO EASE, OUTLOOK IS VERY STRONG, SO THEY ARE ABLE TO ABSORB THESE BUMPS IF AND WHEN THEY COME. DANI: I SO YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING ABOUT SOME OF THE SMALLER BANKS AND YOU ESTIMATED THAT 30% TO 40% OF BANKS UNDER $100 BILLION IN ASSETS HAVE AT LEAST 200 BASIS POINTS OF EXCESS CAPITAL, YET THE CONSENSUS FOR PAYOUT EXPECTATIONS HAVEN'T CHANGED. SHOULD THEY CHANGE? SHOULD WE EXPECT MORE PAYOUTS COMING FROM THE SMALLER BANKS? CHRIS: WE SHOULD. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE CAPITAL BILLED FOR THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PRETTY ROBUST. WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF LOAN GROWTH. WITH THE BANKS ARE MAKING 13%, 14% ON EQUITY, THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCUMULATE CAPITAL AT A FAIRLY RAPID RATE. THE CONCERNS ON CAPITAL THAT WERE 2023, 20 24, THOSE HAVE ABATED. WE HAVE SEEN CAPITAL LEVELS CONTINUING TO RISE. WHAT THAT DOES IS IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. YOU CAN GROW YOUR COMPANY. YOU CAN PAY A COMPETITIVE DIVIDEND. Q. ARE SEEING LARGE BANKS PAY OUT A LOT IN BUYBACKS. FOR THE SMALLER BANKS WE THINK THERE ARE TWO AVENUES. YOU ARE SEEING SELECT BUYBACKS. IT IS A BROAD RANGE OF CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT. THAT FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT. MATT: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON \"OPEN INTEREST.\" ON MONDAY, REBECCA PATTERSON FROM THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS JOINS US AS WELL AS ELI LILLY'S CFO.

{"title": "California’s billionaire tax plan will backfire", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/122f71b9-bf0f-47c3-a46d-827740d4ce73", "summary": "Over the past 50 years the state has become overly reliant on a few deep pockets that it cannot afford to lose", "content": "The writer is a longtime Silicon Valley investor\n\nWhat do you do if you occupy a powerful position in a state with the highest personal income tax rate in the US? If you’re the leader of one of California’s most powerful unions or Ro Khanna, a Californian congressman positioning himself for the 2028 presidential race, you try to confiscate the possessions of California’s wealthiest residents. It’s a plan that in the long term will punish not the wealthy but everyday Californians.\n\nThat’s the backdrop for a proposed one-time wealth tax in California. If added to the election ballot and passed this November, it would seize 5 per cent of the assets of anyone whose net worth — whether liquid or illiquid — exceeds $1bn, which includes people like me.\n\nThis proposal, echoed in various other states, is the latest in a debilitating series of policies that, over the past 70 years, have undermined California’s position as a cradle for progress.\n\nIn 1957, Fairchild Semiconductor, the company that spawned Silicon Valley, was formed by eight men — only one of whom was born in California. At the start of that decade the state’s population was about 10.5mn and only about 11 per cent of its revenue of $1.1bn came from personal income taxes. The sales and use tax (levied on products not services) accounted for almost 60 per cent.\n\nToday, California’s population is about 39.5mn while its budget is about $320bn (not including the $174bn the state receives from Washington for social welfare programmes). Since 1990, the budget has grown at an average rate of 6 per cent a year.\n\nCompared to the 1950s, the source of the state’s revenue has entirely flipped. In recent years personal income taxes have contributed more than 60 per cent of the total. This revenue rests on a foundation of jelly. In 2022, the top 1 per cent of California taxpayers — just 170,000 payers — coughed up about 40 per cent of all the state’s personal income tax revenues. Worse still, these payments are highly contingent on unpredictable capital gains.\n\nThis reliance on a few deep pockets has happened gradually over the past 50 years. In 1978, Proposition 13 deprived the state of its most predictable source of revenue by putting a cap on property taxes and the rate at which these could be increased.\n\nMeanwhile, public service workers gained more power in the mid-1970s when schoolteachers were granted the right to strike followed, in 1977, by the rest of the workforce. Today, they are organised into 21 different bargaining units. Two examples of this concentration of power are the catastrophic 1999 legislative decision to give state employees a retroactive pension increase and the fact that 40 per cent of California’s General Fund must be spent on K-12 education — a tribute to the strength of the teachers’ union. Yet the standard of public education in California trails the national average.\n\nIn addition, the state is responsible for around $200bn of unfunded pension liabilities for state employees. Unlike their private sector counterparts, state employees don’t have to plan for their own retirement as their plans are guaranteed by the state. Those Californians without a retirement safety net are also on the hook for more than $85bn in associated retiree and health benefits for state workers. In 1961, the state contributed about $5 per employee per month to cover the same bills.\n\nIt would be one thing if, even with the highest taxes in the country, the state had delivered for its citizens — but it has failed on almost every count. California has the nation’s highest unemployment rate, its highest homeless population, its highest median housing prices, and its highest gas and electricity prices (save for Hawaii). Tragically, student tuition fees at what was once a beacon for public education, the University of California, Berkeley, have risen from about $1,000 a year in 1980 to about $17,500 today.\n\nThe irony of the proposed wealth tax is that people like me will be just fine. We can either clench our teeth and pay or follow those who have fled for more hospitable climes with no personal income tax such as Florida, Nevada and Texas (which, incidentally, passed a constitutional amendment banning a wealth tax). The same holds for ambitious youngsters wanting to start the next Alphabet, Meta or Fairchild Semiconductor.\n\nBut if just a fraction of California’s deepest pockets leave the state as result of this wealth tax, it will be the hard-working people of California who will have Congressman Khanna and his acolytes to thank for what could amount to a $0.5tn tax bill coming their way over the next decade.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:28 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-13T05:31:28.951196"}
{"title": "When robots meet commercial reality", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/ed4e523e-923c-493d-b402-98a03f0cf7dd", "summary": "Implementing automation systems requires a lot of planning, time and money", "content": "“The ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner,” Nvidia’s Jensen Huang said in January last year. This January he said the ChatGPT moment for physical AI was “nearly here”.\n\nChatGPT was the fastest-growing consumer app in history, according to a report from UBS, reaching 100mn monthly active users within two months of launch. If that sort of explosive adoption is what Huang meant by a “ChatGPT moment” then I think we have much longer to wait.\n\nThere have, of course, been advances in the deployment of robotics over the past year, not least the steady and impressive progress of self-driving cars. But there have also been some retreats. US supermarket chain Kroger, for example, announced in November it would close three of its eight robotic warehouses, which pick and dispatch orders to customers. At the same time, it said it was expanding its relationship with gig economy companies like Instacart and DoorDash, which marshal self-employed humans to act as “personal shoppers” for customers.\n\nIt’s tempting to ask who needs automation when you can just have a low-paid gig worker nip to the shops for you. Although that’s not entirely fair, the story does offer an insight into what happens when robots meet commercial realities.\n\nFirst, while “adopting” generative AI as a business can be as quick and simple as paying a monthly subscription to OpenAI or Anthropic, implementing robotic systems generally requires planning, time and money. The Kroger warehouses (powered by technology from UK company Ocado) required huge amounts of expensive kit. In a low-margin business like selling groceries, that means you need to forecast demand very accurately in order to maximise utilisation.\n\n“It’s a bit more like a factory set-up: it needs to have minimum throughput to make money,” Tom Andersson, a warehouse automation expert at research company STIQ, told me. “In the end, you need to have a really good business case for why you do automation, and when you do those business cases — because sometimes these projects can take three years in the planning — if your forecast is wrong at that point it will be tricky.”\n\nThat is not to say that automation in the grocery sector is a non-starter. The business case for Ocado’s automated warehouses in the densely populated UK, for instance, seems to stack up better. In the Netherlands, an online grocery company called Picnic has made headway with a similar approach. And plenty of supermarket chains have invested in automation further up the supply chain. Walmart has increased revenues by more than $150bn over the past five years, yet its headcount has come down slightly over the same period. It is still a vast employer, though, with more than 2mn staff on its books.\n\nRobot enthusiasts believe a new breed of humanoid robots will make further inroads into physical work. One of the great advantages of building robots that look like humans is that — in theory — you can slot them seamlessly into workplaces that are already built for humans. That could make the deployment of robots more gradual and flexible, and less of an enormous upfront bet.\n\nBut even if humanoids do achieve human-level capabilities this year, as Huang predicts, there will still be practical problems for businesses to consider. First, to deploy AI-powered humanoid robots alongside humans in the workplace, you need to be confident they are safe. In a white-collar setting, a hallucinating chatbot might make up a number or reference and damage your reputation or your bottom line. In a blue-collar setting, a malfunctioning humanoid could be physically dangerous.\n\nSecond, humanoid and canine robots just don’t have much stamina for now, because of limitations with battery technology. As James Pikul, associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has written, the Boston Dynamics robot Spot can only operate for about 90 minutes before it needs to recharge. By way of comparison, it is common for human staff in factories and warehouses to work 10-hour shifts with a couple of breaks.\n\nWhat does all this add up to? There is every reason to believe that automation will continue to increase in a range of physical settings. But technologists and investors should take care not to conflate technical breakthroughs with commensurate transformations of the real economy. As Kroger’s retreat shows, just because a technology exists and works does not mean it will always be commercial to deploy it. In other words, the fact a job can be automated doesn’t necessarily mean it will be automated.\n\nsarah.oconnor@ft.com", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:28 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-13T05:31:29.577904"}

So this time yesterday, we talked about limited reaction in markets to the Fed narrative, as dramatic as it was. By the end of the day in the States, we'd seen almost no reaction really net meds to what was happening. Is that is this a story on pause now because of the substantial pushback that we've seen from parts of the administration, from Congress, and from senators? I mean, I think with this administration, you can never say something is completely gone in terms of we could get another headline. But in terms of the news that we've had so far, I think it's largely been digested by the market as no different from other threats to the Fed's credibility that we've had previously that proved to be not standing the test of time in terms of not having a long term market impact, not deterring people from buying U.S. assets, certainly. And I think the clearest sign you can see of that is the front end of the yield curve in terms of if you were seriously considering threats of the Fed's independence that forced them to cut more aggressively, you'd expect that to be priced a little bit in the frontend, but it's not at all you didn't see movement in where those cuts were priced. So I think it's kind of on to the next thing, although, you know, we could certainly get more headlines around this and we probably will. And the next thing being more inflation or less inflation. Yes. So we'll get the inflation data today. And the way I'm thinking about it is there's a relatively high bar for it to be dovish. And I'll give you two reasons for that. The first is the kind of shift we've seen in the emphasis on the Fed's mandate in terms of inflation has kind of been pushed to the backburner. Powell talked about it being transitory. It's not something that's been considered as strongly. So it's something that's not mattering as much. And I think too, because we got employment data last week, it did kind of skew more to the strong side. Yes, it was a bit mixed in terms of nonfarm payrolls coming in a bit weaker than expectations. But the important bit was unemployment ticked down. So that's a positive sign in terms of you can't place in a lot of divergence under that labor market contact or equity markets just because he did dovish. Isn't that kind of. Well the either do growth is positive which is great for equities as earnings are positive or you do. Oh no it's a little bit soft in the data and that means we can get some divergence. And that's great because you're going to re-evaluate. Yeah. When does it's going to what are you watching for when it comes to Japan that could make Japan not just a Japan story but a global story? Yeah, I think there's a couple of things in terms of the long end yield, if that kind of continues to creep higher, I think because that's acted as a lower bound on where butane yields are, if that moves up, it pushes everything else up as well. And I'm very seriously considering Japanese intervention as well from an effects perspective. So what you've seen happening is over 60 level one. 61. Yeah, well, this is it. It's there's this talk around. You can't have Japanese intervention in the market because that would weaken the equity market and you don't want that if you are actually having an election. But it's also not good to have a weakness because it's essentially a consumption tax. So it's not a good thing from that perspective either. So I think it's something you need to watch. Certainly as you head to those psychologically important levels. As you're mentioning, 160, you've been disconnected from fundamentals for a while and generally the precursor is verbal intervention. And we've had some of that already. Even this morning. There's been comments about it being disconnected. So I think certainly something to watch and not ignore just because you're worried about the equity market. Just one just quick question. Staples went up yesterday in America. What's going on? I this should be recessionary indicators yet Walmart was flying. Is it because Trump's trying to help the bottom with the K or is it because there's a recession coming? I mean, I think it would be more because Trump's trying to have the bottom of the cake. We've had big fiscal headwinds out there that what I would point to. But also it could just be, you know, you have your days where positioning kind of move things and it's a bad reason for something. But like if you don't have the fundamental right, then it's not fair to kind of I'm just looking for narrative.

Iran’s partners include not only neighboring states, but large economies including India, Turkey and China.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court adjourned for the holidays without ruling on Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to justify tariffs, all will remain in effect until the justices make their decision. That’ll likely be in early January.\n\nIn several social media posts, Trump has called the case before the Supreme Court the most consequential in the nation’s history, mostly because he views tariffs as a way to fix the nation’s unsustainable fiscal trajectory and pressure foreign governments to bend to his wishes. Either way the court rules, Trump’s top trade advisers say tariffs — invoked under other, more legally sound laws — will remain a key part of the president’s economic goals to make America a manufacturing powerhouse again.\n\nHere’s a compilation of measures both implemented and planned, accompanied by a Bloomberg Economics view on the effect.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:00:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-13T10:59:00.505425"}

Its goal was simple: at times of upheaval, it would allow the government to cut off ordinary Iranians from the world, and potentially from each other, while allowing the Islamic republic’s government and economy to continue functioning within the borders of this parallel network.\n\nBut here was Mohammad Jahromi, then-minister of information and communications technology, sitting at the head of a large table in Tehran, showing screenshot after screenshot of conversations between Iranians trying to organise protests in November 2019.\n\nThey came from the chat window of a regime-approved video game.\n\n“That’s when it became clear: the experiment in the ‘halal internet’ wasn’t working,” said the engineer, now living in exile in Europe. “The next time, they would have to shut it all down.”\n\nLast Thursday that is exactly what Iran did: it almost completely closed down the internet in one of the deepest and most sophisticated blackouts in history, experts who study digital repression said.\n\nThat has allowed the regime to pull a veil over the true extent of the protests and its own brutal crackdown, while hampering ordinary Iranians’ ability to organise on social media.\n\nSo complete was the shutdown that even regime insiders issued with so-called “white” Sim cards, allowing unfettered access in the past, found themselves cut off from the internet, said two cyber security researchers. People with these privileges had been able to use them during the blackout that accompanied the 12-day Iran-Israel war in 2025 when the NIN also continued to function.\n\nPiercing that veil has presented an immense challenge. But people like the software engineer and other supporters of Iranian internet freedom have spent years preparing for this scenario.\n\nIn the engineer’s case, he left his job with the government, moved abroad and got involved in a project to smuggle in Starlink receivers into the country across the borders with Iraqi Kurdistan and Armenia.\n\nThe project took advantage of a Joe Biden-era sanctions exemption given in 2022 for US tech companies to offer communication tools in Iran. At that time Elon Musk activated access for the country to SpaceX’s Starlink constellation of satellites.\n\nOthers, many of them émigrés or self-exiles from Iran’s entrepreneurial cyber security and telecoms sector, built or customised software to overcome the government’s blocks.\n\nOne messaging service, described to the FT by an active user, piggybacks on the bare-bones internet infrastructure that the regime has allowed to remain functional, turning a small government-approved email network into a means of communication with the outside world. A basic text-only browser service can also evade the blocks.\n\nThe few videos that have trickled out have been viewed around the world: hundreds of bodies outside morgues, the sound of machine gun fire at a protest site and the voices of ordinary Iranians, describing the killing of loved ones and the chaos on the streets.\n\n“In many ways, this is the worst shutdown we have seen in my 15 years of working in this space,” said Fereidoon Bashar, executive director at ASL19, a Canadian company with roots at Toronto university that helped create some digital backdoors to the outside world.\n\n“But despite their attempt to shut everything down, they haven’t succeeded in making sure that nothing gets out, including their brutal and deadly crackdown [on] protests,” he said. “It’s definitely more than they would have liked to get out.”\n\nIranians protest in Tehran last week. The regime has attempted to cut off internet access to the outside world but pictures and videos are still emerging © West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\nResearchers studying Iran’s attempts to build guardrails around its internet describe a decades-long, expensive effort propelled by the regime’s paranoia.\n\nIn the early days of the internet in the 1990s, Iran’s only digital link with the outside world was a small particle physics lab called the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences.\n\nSince then, the Islamic republic has allowed only one additional conduit to the global internet, the Telecommunication Infrastructure Company, said researchers at Project Ainita who have studied Iran’s multi-layered control over the flow of information.\n\nThat has made it relatively simple for the regime to cut off access to the outside world, compared with other populous countries which have dozens or hundreds of access points.\n\n“There is a single point of failure,” said one of the researchers, who asked not to be named. “The internet is not supposed to be like this. This is by design.”\n\nProject Ainita’s analysis of this blackout showed it appeared to have happened “in a panic”, the researcher said. “It really feels like someone came into the room with an order that said ‘cut it all now’, and then it was done.”\n\nIn its haste, the Iranian government appears to have also taken the National Information Network offline, at least initially.\n\n“They basically decapitated everything: banks went offline, ATMs stopped working, phones and even government news websites went offline,” the researcher said.\n\nThe sharp cut-off gave the government the opportunity to reconnect parts of the NIN, keeping a stranglehold on news but restoring functionality to parts of the economy.\n\nResearchers said banking functions have been largely restored albeit with restrictions on how much cash individuals can withdraw. Petrol pumps are processing payments and some government services are being restored.\n\nHesam Nourouz Pour, who was consulted by the Iranian government when it started setting up the NIN early in 2010, said: “From a policy perspective, they have achieved what they wanted to achieve.”\n\nNourouz Pour, now a visiting lecturer at Copenhagen university, said parts of the NIN coming online while the country remains largely cut off from the global internet amounted to “the ideal situation for them”.\n\nThat has left a small group of internet activists, working secretly, trying to get information out of Iran and help galvanise the protests. Musk’s Starlink connections have been at the core of the effort, said two people involved in the process.\n\nAhmad Ahmadian, executive director of US-based group Holistic Resilience, said his team initially helped smuggle in Starlinks to trusted human rights activists, journalists and satellite television networks after the 2022 Biden-era sanctions exemptions.\n\nThen a black market for the devices emerged and thousands were smuggled into the country for ordinary Iranians to watch Netflix, post on Instagram and trade cryptocurrencies. That gave the country a small but robust network of Starlinks to share videos and sensitive information abroad when the regime shut off the internet.\n\n“From the very first day, we saw from every single part of the country videos that were coming out,” he said. “People were coming up with very ingenious ways to share their Starlink bandwidth — setting up systems for people outside Iran to get in touch with their families.\n\n“These are high-risk activities,” Ahmadian added. In 2010 he shared an Iranian prison cell with a journalist who had been detained for using a satellite phone. “We knew this day was coming, and we wanted to be prepared for that.”\n\nShow video info Show video description Video description Transcript Donald Trump talks about the ongoing protests in Iran and how Elon Musk could help with the internet blackout There seem to be some people killed that aren't supposed to be killed. These are violent. If you call them leaders, I don't know if they're leaders, they're just they, they rule through violence, but we're looking at it very seriously, the military's looking at it. And uh we're looking at some very strong options, we'll make a determination. Are you going to send Charley? To help If you well, we're gonna, we're gonna be talking about that. We may get the internet going if that's possible. We may speak to Elon. Because as you know, he's very good at that kind of thing, he's got a very good company, so we may speak to Elon Musk, and, uh, in fact, I'm gonna call him as soon as I'm finished with you. Donald Trump said on Monday that he would speak to Elon Musk about the internet blackout in Iran © Reuters\n\nSpaceX on Tuesday appeared to have made Starlink access in Iran free of charge, with users able to log on without paying a subscription fee.\n\nIn the past few days, groups using the Starlinks to evade the blackout have reported outages. These could be the result of military-grade electronic warfare, an expensive and geographically limited effort that would involve brute-force jamming of the frequencies used by SpaceX’s satellites.\n\nSuch tactics have worked, if sporadically, for Iran’s ally Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine, where Starlinks are used extensively by the Ukrainian army.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut other activists attributed the ebb and flow of videos from within Iran to a far simpler challenge: users may have sought to evade detection by the security services by only using the Starlinks sporadically, hiding their distinctive antennas from snooping neighbours and drones trained to pick them out from rooftops.\n\nIranian state TV on Tuesday showed more than 1,000 electronic devices such as mobile phones and signal boosters that the information ministry seized, saying they had been smuggled illegally into the country to be used for espionage.\n\nIn a sense Iran’s firewall is the inverse of China’s great firewall in that Beijing has created its own vibrant versions of applications such as WeChat and TikTok, while restricting its citizens’ access to some parts of the global internet.\n\nIn Iran, the government has essentially blacklisted the entire internet and is experimenting with “white listing” some essential services to keep its sputtering economy functional, said Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at Miaan Group.\n\n“State television said some services on the NIN were functional, but those services are still disrupted,” he said. “And there’s a technical challenge to this: they want to whitelist things and bring some services online, while controlling the narrative.”\n\nTehran may continue throttling access to the internet for Iranians trying to re-establish unfettered contact with the outside world, said Amanda Meng at the School of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\n“A bigger concern is what the internet is going to look like when it does come back online. Iran has become much more sophisticated in how they are implementing these shutdowns.”\n\nShe added: “Things are going to be really different when it does come back online, and be a lot more like [China].”", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-14T05:31:21.458857"}

Normal voting rights, for instance, would not initially be available to Ukraine in leaders’ summits and ministerial meetings, according to the officials.\n\nUnder the proposals still being developed, Kyiv would gain incremental access to parts of the bloc’s single market, its agricultural subsidies and its internal development funding after meeting post-membership milestones.\n\nThat would drastically change accession rules agreed in 1993 that require countries to meet vast amounts of EU regulations across swaths of policy areas, and only enter the club when all boxes have been ticked.\n\n“Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures . . . We’re not undermining enlargement. We’re enlarging the concept of enlargement,” said one senior EU diplomat briefed on the concept. “The rules were written more than 30 years ago. And they need to be more flexible. This is a once-in-a-generation moment and we have to meet it.”\n\nBut diplomats from EU member states and other aspirational members that have been involved in informal discussions with the Commission about the proposal said there was deep unease about the concept. Some fear it would have a negative impact on the bloc’s future stability, cheapen the value of membership and upset other candidate countries.\n\n“It’s a trap set by Putin and Trump and we are walking into it,” said a second EU diplomat, citing the risk to the bloc’s unity.\n\n“The EU is once again stuck between a rock and a very hard place,” said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe managing director at Eurasia Group. “It has no choice but to expedite Ukraine’s accession, yet doing so will open a Pandora’s box of political and policy risks no one in Brussels quite fully understands.”\n\nUkraine’s progress through the existing membership process has been held up by Hungary, which has blocked the unanimous approval required to formally open and close each of its 35 so-called accession “chapters”.\n\nEU and Ukrainian officials believe that if the US is a signatory to the eventual peace plan, it will force Budapest and its close ally President Donald Trump to give way.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the Commission president, on Thursday linked Ukraine’s accession to the peace talks. “Accession is both a key security guarantee in its own right for Ukraine, but also the essential engine for future growth and prosperity,” she said.\n\nBut a large group of existing EU members, while keen to support Ukraine, are fiercely resistant to any measures that would either create loopholes in the rules or set up a two-tier membership system, four bloc diplomats said.\n\n“You can’t have a merit-based process with a fixed completion date,” said one of those diplomats.\n\n“Try to force this down the throat of the member states and they will never accept it,” said a senior EU official, warning it would open a damaging rift between Brussels and member states.\n\nOther officials said any move to adjust the enlargement process would also disrupt the ambitions of other accession candidates, and pose wider questions about how the EU interacts with its close neighbours.\n\nMontenegro and Albania are closest to gaining membership in terms of progress through the chapters, and may feel like they are being offered a less appealing prize, three of the seven people said.\n\nIt would also raise questions about whether other states that have made little or no progress towards membership in recent years — such as Bosnia and Turkey — would be offered the same enlargement-lite option.\n\nIt is unclear how it would affect the European Economic Area countries such as Norway, which are part of the single market without voting rights, or other non-accession but close partner countries such as the UK.\n\n“You’re posing huge, difficult questions with something like this,” said a third senior EU diplomat. “There are so many unforeseen outcomes possible.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Laura Dubois in Limassol", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:31 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T05:14:29.842918"}

Back in 2010, it was fiscal and finance threats — at least according to an annual survey of participants in the World Economic Forum meeting at Davos. Then in 2020 environmental issues topped the league.\n\nNow worries about war, of both the kinetic and economic sort, are dominating, judging from the latest WEF poll. Fiscal issues have plunged to 17th place. This is striking. However, as the Davos tribe gathers next week, investors should remember a key point: the WEF consensus is often wrong. So much so that some hedge fund types joke that the smartest trade is to do the opposite of whatever the Davos discourse implies.\n\nSo could 2026 be the year that fiscal risks finally explode in an “economic reckoning”, to cite the WEF? Should we care that global debt now sits at above 235 per cent of global GDP, and rising, at a time when markets seem calm?\n\nIt is an interesting question to ponder in the US, where the debt-to-GDP ratio has jumped above 100 per cent and President Donald Trump is bullying the Federal Reserve into lowering rates to reduce debt-servicing costs. So, too, in the UK, given its weak growth and rising debt.\n\nBut another place that merits more debate is Japan, which (in)famously has net and gross debt-to-GDP ratios of 130 and 240 per cent respectively. Japan is currently a darling for global equity investors, because it seems relatively stable — compared with the US — and its companies crucial for global supply chains in sectors ranging from robotics to shipping.\n\nBetter still, its new(ish) leader Sanae Takaichi has promised economic reforms and enjoys a stunning 76 per cent approval, thanks in part to her refreshing style. Indeed, this week the Japanese stock market hit record highs, amid news that Takaichi will declare a snap election to consolidate her power — a move that could usher in a $135bn stimulus package and more reforms.\n\nSo far, so exciting. But this week the yen also tumbled to almost ¥160 to the dollar. That is as startling as Takaichi’s drumming. “According to both the IMF and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the purchasing power parity for yen/dollar is in the 90s,” Peter Tasker, a Japan analyst at Arcus, points out.\n\nAnd while this weakness used to be blamed on Japan’s zero interest rate policy, this week 10-year yields on Japanese government bonds (or JGBs) hit 2.16 per cent, sharply higher than in recent years.\n\nWhy? Robin Brooks, former chief economist of the Institute of International Finance, thinks this signals a looming crisis. “The yen is falling because markets want to see interest rates rise, which are still at artificially low levels and don’t compensate investors enough for what they see as rising risk of default,” he argues. And while the Bank of Japan wants to end quantitative easing, that would raise servicing costs, and “risk pushing Japan into a fiscal crisis”, Brooks says. “Japan is trapped.”\n\nOthers, like Tasker, disagree. “Some people seem to enjoy apocalyptic narratives about Japanese finance,” he says, insisting that higher rates are “just another piece of evidence showing that Japan is normalising”. More specifically, as Matthew Klein of the Overshoot notes, Japan is finally seeing higher growth and prices, after years of stagnation.\n\nThis is already shrinking the deficit. And one issue that possibly makes the debt burden less threatening is that over 90 per cent of JGBs are domestically held. This means that if future haircuts occur, it might be easier for the market to swallow them than in a place like the US or Europe, since Japan retains a strong culture of shared sacrifice and patriotic duty.\n\nHowever, that may not protect Japan forever. As the BoJ notes in its latest financial stability report, “foreign investors, including hedge funds, have increased transaction volume in JGB markets significantly”. Indeed, somewhat remarkably, they represent two-thirds of all cash trading, seemingly because hedgies are playing the so-called basis trade with JGBs, echoing US Treasuries.\n\nWhen that basis trade was suddenly unwound in Treasuries in 2020, US bond markets melted down. And that could happen again in Japan, particularly given the prominence of the yen carry trade. In short: if a fiscal panic erupts, it could spiral fast.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I am not predicting that Takaichi (whom I admire) will mess up; nor that there will be an immediate crisis in US Treasuries or gilts. But the key point is this: what is happening in Japan reflects a paradox, namely that debt keeps inexorably growing but most investors seem willing to give governments the benefit of the doubt, never mind that we have no idea how this can ever be resolved. This complacency looks likely to continue in 2026. However, the risk of a so-called Wile E Coyote moment in which investors suddenly look down and panic cannot be removed by silence alone.\n\nRemember: back in 2018, as I noted at the time, the Davos tribe was utterly uninterested in talking about pandemic risks — until they were shocked by the subsequent Covid-19 outbreak, and wondered why they had ignored what was hidden in plain sight. Let us hope this does not play out again in the financial world; silence matters as much as noise.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T05:14:30.840932"}
{"title": "Trump is making the world fall in love with China", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/658e3fc5-4a43-4dd5-8942-cf2f7fe3a686", "summary": "Countries that once saw American success as their own now view the US as an adversary and Beijing as a model", "content": "The writer is an FT contributing editor, chair of the Centre for Liberal Strategies, and fellow at IWM Vienna\n\n“Without the cold war, what’s the point of being an American?” quips John Updike’s character Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, lampooning his country’s missionary zeal and sense of self-righteousness. “Rabbit,” a white middle‑American everyman whom Updike used to track shifts in US culture and politics, would probably have voted for Donald Trump in the last election.\n\nAmericans and non-Americans alike have become exhausted by decades of double standards and liberal hypocrisy issuing from Washington. That’s why Joe Biden’s attempt to resurrect the cold war struggle between democracies and autocracies in the wake of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine failed so spectacularly. Washington’s move to aggressively sanction Russia instead caused (democratic) India to initially radically increase its purchase of Russian oil, while (democratic) South Africa came close to siding with Moscow in what Putin billed an “anti-imperial” struggle.\n\nThe arrival of Donald Trump signalled an end to hypocrisy and moralising and the arrival of a new form of brutalism and candour in US foreign policy. No more window dressing; no more carefully-calibrated remarks.\n\nIn the absence of constraints, there would no longer be any need for decorative diplomacy. As the sportscaster Howard Cosell famously liked to say, it’s time to “tell it like it is”. Before Trump, when America would attack an oil-rich nation, Washington would claim it was about democracy or security though people would suspect it was about the black gold. Nowadays, the US president is the first to insist that he attacked Venezuela for oil; there’s no longer any pretext about democracy.\n\nBut this end of hypocrisy won’t necessarily make America more respected.\n\nThe recently published global opinion poll commissioned by the European Council on Foreign Relations (conducted before the US’s special operation in Venezuela and before the mass protests in Iran) shows that in the first year of Trump’s second term, a growing number of people believe that China’s already formidable influence will grow — and that this is positive news for their own country and for the world. In other words, Trump may have shaken the globe, but the world is falling for China.\n\nWhy this is so is hardly a mystery. Many of Beijing’s new fans are owners of a Chinese electric car, have installed Chinese solar panels on their roofs, use DeepSeek and watch their children play with toys made in China. Apart from threatening military exercises around Taiwan and in the South China Sea, China is also demonstrably pacifist, carrying out no offensive military operations beyond what it considers its borders.\n\nMachiavelli famously observed that for any ruler, it is better to be feared than to be loved, if one cannot be both. If that’s the case, people should be becoming more sympathetic to Trump’s America. Why, then, is Trump’s constant demonstration of US power not paying dividends?\n\nThe reason could be that when you are powerful, people take note only when that power falters. The world was hardly impressed when Trump went on his tariff rampage; what struck people was when China successfully fought back. America demonstrated stunning military power in Venezuela but it was also expected; what people have noticed is Russia’s military failure in Ukraine.\n\nPeople also notice who envies whom. And it is no secret that Trump envies China; and that to his chagrin the envy goes unrequited. The US president fantasises about the scope of China’s industrial power, so much that he now practices state capitalism Chinese-style. It is as if Trump has lost trust in his country’s political and economic system. As the saying goes, imitation is the highest form of flattery, and now it is Washington imitating Beijing.\n\nPower breeds obedience and conformity — but not loyalty. The powerful should not expect solidarity when their power declines. Trump has convinced many US voters that America First means America alone. But if you are ready to defend only what you own, you should not be surprised that only 16 per cent of Europeans consider America an ally and 20 per cent now see it as a rival or adversary. The strength of ideological alliances is that they promise you support when you look weak. When the US president sees little substantive difference between democracy and autocracy, it’s hard to blame people who fail to fear China and side with America.\n\nAmerica prevailed in the cold war because it insisted on not simply being powerful but in being different. It made people imagine that the victory of the US was their own victory. Many members of the Venezuelan opposition probably maintained this illusion until the moment they understood that Trump’s interest in their country was primarily to secure the theft of Venezuelan oil. Many Iranian protesters probably still cling to the illusion.\n\nAs Updike’s “Rabbit” Angstrom might wonder, without America standing for freedom, or at least pretending to do so, what’s the point of being pro-American?", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T05:14:31.356948"}

From chasing new career goals to navigating last season’s toughest challenges, Max opens up about what drives him and what it takes to stay on top of Formula One. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWe are here at the Detroit Auto Show with four time Formula One champion, Max Verstappen Max. The second half of last season was about as exciting as they get. You were at a 104 point deficit, but ended up only missing out by two points in the last race. How did it feel to you? Just take it race by race, to be honest. You know, we had a bit of a tough time. Yeah. First off. And, you know, some good moments and some bad moments and a bit of a tough start, but second half was a lot more enjoyable. Yeah. Also the team side, like, you know, you you start to feel more comfortable, confident when things are going well Of course, even in the second half we had a few tough races but overall way more competitive. And I think it's always nicer to you to end the season like that. I mean, it was a great way to end, even if, you know, you didn't win the ultimate championship. But I can't imagine working that hard with that set of tools and then having to switch to a completely new set of tools this year in like this most serious rule change that Formula One has had, at least in my memory. Yeah, but I mean, you know that even heading into that season, right? So it's not like it comes as a shock. The team is prepared for that and it's also a bit of a new challenge. I mean, I enjoyed the course the last four years, but at the same time, sometimes, yeah, it doesn't it doesn't hurt to have a bit of a change. Yeah, it can also really upset, of course, the grid, you don't know. So yeah, we'll see how that's how that goes. How do you think the rule changes are going to benefit you as opposed to the rest of the group? I honestly have no idea. I haven't even done that many laps in the simulator, you know, So for me, I will just see what happens when I sit in the car. I think what is always very important as a driver is that you can adapt quickly to to the situation that you're in. If the if if that is on the current car that you've known for a long time or a completely new car, you just need to be able to adapt quickly, learn quickly as well, because the cars will evolve I think also very quickly. But yeah, I'm not I'm not too stressed about that, to be honest. I mean, Red Bull is seen as the most at least the most technologically advanced team in the world. And now you have Ford as a partner. I don't think any CEO, automotive CEO cares about racing more than Jim Farley. What does it mean to you working with Ford? Yeah, it's great. It's a great opportunity as well. I'm just excited, You know, to get started is a massive heritage as well, you know, in in racing as well. So, yeah, I think everyone is just now just very keen to get started. Yeah. I think like of the former winners that have been powered by Ford, Jim Clark Hill Fittipaldi, I mean Jackie Stewart like it's just such an illustrious list. It's almost like you're going to do DFA 2.0 with this new team. Let's see. I mean, yeah, we hope, of course to have a lot of success, but it's impossible to know. The only thing that I do know is that everyone is giving it everything that. What do you think about the development? We've heard that maybe you have found a bit of an edge with compression, variable compression. I guess there's going to be a meeting on January 2nd about how this will work for for you and Mercedes. Do you feel like you have an edge? It's impossible to know. I mean, everyone is just trying everything they can. And from our side and especially from my side, I mean, I have to focus on the driving. You know, I'm not there to be the the engine technician. And we'll explain everything in detail to you. And at the end of the day, it's also something between the FIA and the car manufacturers and to the engine manufacturers to sort out. And I drive the car and I trust that from our side, you know, we we always try to do our very best to get the most performance out of the out of the engine. Are you excited to have more nimble, a smaller, more nimble car? Is that more exciting for you? Because it'll be easier, I guess, in that instance to pass. I mean, it's a bit too soon to be able to say that, that it will be easier to pass. I've no idea. So, you know, everything is still unknown, you know, So the cars, I think, look a bit nicer when they're a bit smaller and they're not as wide. But yeah, once we get on track, then it's a bit easier to get a bit of an understanding of what is all happening and going on. Let's talk about your career outside of F1. I can hear The Sims going over there and I know you're deep into that with Red Line. So what's what are you most interested in outside of racing on the track, which I'm sure is your main focus almost all the time. But in any spare time you have, you mean outside of like sim racing and stuff. No, no. Including surfing Green is that. It's of course you want to win whatever we compete in, right. I want to try and help young drivers, young people that don't have the opportunities also in real life, you know, to have an opportunity to actually then become a real racing driver that all stars, of course, in the simulator. And yes, it's just very exciting to see these young guys. It's, you know, started what? 16 may be in the team and see them grow as well over the years with with the potential to, you know, maybe get a real, real life drive, which we have done. Last season, one of the same drivers and you know, he's doing a really good job and it's just really nice to see how how that is all progressing. Do you think about that as a progression? I mean, do you have, for example, a certain number of championships in mind that you want to win before you can walk away? Or are you still going to be starting races that you know, is like 44 years old? Can you see that as a future for yourself? It's all honestly, like it's just I don't really think about it too much. I think it's more important to just try and enjoy it. You know, some of the enjoyment is there, and it's also easier to to rock up and really demand everything from yourself. And so far, I'm I'm so, you know, having that feeling. You seem to be enjoying a little bit of g t racing, maybe ready to do a little bit of endurance racing. I hear you signed up for the 24 hours of Nurburgring. Well, about that is still nothing confirmed yet. I mean, the plan would be nice, you know, if that's possible. That is also very, you know, very hectic for a few months now in Formula One. So we have to wait and see. That is definitely my goal. You know, I want to do it 25 races and I want to do endurance. And of course, having started with GT3 racing as well with the team, yeah, that's definitely the the future plan. Are you just aiming for an outright win at Lamar or do you think about, for example, the Triple Crown? Is that something that enters the picture? Uh, Triple Crown, Not so much for me personally. Yeah. I would love to do them all. And actually if you do it, you want, you want to try and win it. So in terms of my my co-anchor Dani Burger, she's a huge F1 fan and she wants to know if you're still friends with Lando. Yeah, I mean, that that has never changed. So it's just always been got a little spicy at the end of the last season. Got spicy. That is also a bit of fun, you know, and it's was just being, being like that. And obviously also the medium, the media makes it always probably a bit more spicy than it actually is.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:30:34 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T17:41:43.158091"}

Bloomberg's Mandeep Singh joins to discuss on Bloomberg Intelligence. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nI think everyone is looking at Gigawatt Data centers, right? And when you think about what is existing in terms of air data centers, these are 5200 megawatt data centers. We're already talking about power requirements going ten X to one gigawatt. And and so how will a 70 to 80 year old grid supply electricity, which is ten times more than what these data centers already consume? And so from that perspective, it is a very topical question that needs to be asked where are you getting the ten times power that you need to run your one gigawatt data center? And I think that's the realization that's coming in now. It's being reflected in the prices that consumers have to pay because prices have gone up for electricity. But I mean, the computing that air does requires ten times more power. Now we're getting starts the realization and I think everything will follow through. Now, Mandeep, is there a sense that big tech leaders might be open to working with the White House on this to kind of be in Trump's favor here? And what might the impact be on their profit growth? I mean, there's no doubt that air data centers are a much lower gross margin business for Hyperscalers and these Hyperscalers. I mean, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the three big ones, have a huge footprint when it comes to the traditional CPU data centers. They were able to get to, you know, 65 to 70% gross margins on their public cloud businesses they had. Now with AI workloads, we're talking about a sub 50% gross margin business no matter what kind of scale you have, just because of the economics involved, these are sub 50% gross margin businesses. So on premise software used to be 80 to 90% gross margin. With public cloud, we got to 65 to 70. With AI, we are sub 50 gross margin. So from that perspective, I mean, even if you're Microsoft, you don't have a choice, but your margins will have to come down. We're also looking at semiconductor stocks as the best performers in the S & P 500 by two dozen industry groups. And it feels like that TSMC bullish forecast was very much a tailwind for the industry. Obviously, this is good news in terms of demand, but does anyone lose out here when TSMC is can't even meet the demand that is being required of it? Well, lose out, I think I mean, what we have seen really is Intel really benefiting. So I wouldn't say anybody is losing out, but clearly everyone is so focused right now on the A.I. side that I feel suddenly everyone realizes, oh, storage is in short supply. We didn't talk about storage up until, you know, the beginning of this year. So there will be, you know, instances like this where one of the components gets neglected and suddenly everyone finds that to be in short supply when you need it. So it could happen. I think CPU's nobody talked about CPU's in the past 12 months. Some of these CPUs are in short supply. So that's where you know, the i.t. Infrastructure needs to be upgraded every four or five years and then the time comes to upgrade the infrastructure. Certain components, even if they are not tied to air, it could be in short supply because we have reallocated the resources towards meeting the air demands.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:24:33 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T17:41:43.711569"}

Many smaller, lesser-known schools like Cazenovia have already hit the precipice. They’re firing professors, paring back liberal arts courses in favor of STEM &mdash; or closing altogether.\n\nBloomberg's Elizabeth Rembert joined Bloomberg Intelligence to discuss with Scarlet Fu and Alex Semenova. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nThe demographic cliff is essentially the consequence of a birth rate that started falling around the great financial crisis. Women stopped having as many babies and that birth rate has never recovered. And now we're about 18 years later. Those missing babies aren't around to go to college. So that means that there's a possibility for some schools. Each incoming class could be smaller than the last. Elizabeth, fantastic reporting on this story. What are schools doing to adapt to this demographic, Cliff? Yes, that is something that a lot of experts stressed is there is room to adapt to this challenge. And schools are, for example, bringing on a degree, programs that are in high demand like artificial intelligence, health, cybersecurity, others have taken to adding on extracurriculars and sports that can appeal to students. There was one school that we talked to that brought on a bass fishing team that was very popular and drew in a lot of students. Also, some schools are targeting older students and trying to offer more flexible course studies. Those are the ones who have figured out a solution. But for many schools, especially the smaller and lesser known ones, they have no choice but to close. What happens when they close? What happens to their debt? What happens to their endowments that they still have won? Yes. Yes. It can be really devastating when small school close, even if these are like lesser known schools with not very many students. There's a study that shows that less than half of students re-enroll in another school when they're when their college closes before they graduate. And towns are left without a key economic engine as far as the muni debt. Sometimes when school is closed, investors have faced losses of as much as 50%, and then the endowments get redistributed. That usually goes to the attorney general to figure out where those funds are going to go. Is it only these smaller schools that are hurt by this, or is it the big state schools, the Harvards of the world? They're all going to be looking at a smaller pool of high school graduates. But the experts say that this probably won't play out at Harvard. Harvard has more than 20 applicants for every seat that they have available. So even if there's less high school graduates, they're all going to be clamoring for that Ivy League degree. And then those big state schools like thinking about the University of California, USC, the University of Texas, they have plenty of brand recognition to draw students in as well. What we've seen a lot of schools do is and this includes the Harvards and the big state schools as well, is recruit international students to fill the gap left by fewer domestic applicants. However, we just got data showing that foreign student enrollment is down 1.3% this fall, the first drop in three years. So that is no longer a lever they can pull. Yes. Yes. And that's been very challenging. Schools were dealing with this existential crisis of the demographic cliff. Like you say, international students has been kind of a way to plug that gap, less domestic students. Let's look at the international markets. And this has just dealt a really big challenge to those schools, just shrinking the market further. And Elizabeth, what happens when a school closes? Yeah, it's very it's very devastating. The towns lose their economic engine. All of a sudden, they have this big campus that they have to that they have to figure out to find another person to come over and take in. And not very you know, these are old campuses. They're hard to adapt. It just leaves a lot of these places and students and faculty floundering.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:08:14 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T18:46:04.818172"}

{"title": "The dangerous triumph of neo-mercantilism", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/cd68b35f-f00d-4a7d-a9be-56c639dd6b91", "summary": "Liberal trade policies are giving way to frictions that could lead to outright conflict", "content": "In the first 11 months of 2025, China ran a customs trade surplus of over $1tn. According to Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations, in 2025 as a whole, its “overall goods surplus . . . should — if accurately measured — approach an astonishing $1.2tn dollars (6 per cent of China’s GDP, well over a percentage point of the GDP of all of China’s trading partners).”\n\nOver much the same period, Donald Trump, obsessed with US trade deficits — both overall and, even more, in manufactured goods — raised average tariff rates to an estimated 14.4 per cent, the highest level since shortly after the second world war.\n\nWhy is China running such huge trade surpluses and why is the US abandoning the relatively liberal trade policies of the past eight decades? The answer is the revival of mercantilism.\n\nMercantilism dominated European thinking on international economic policy in the 17th and 18th centuries. Mercantilists’ underlying belief was that international economic policy is primarily a tool of state power. Since power, unlike prosperity, is relative, mercantilists think of international economic engagement as “zero sum”: you win, I lose. Mercantilists also treasure domestic production and love trade surpluses and protection against imports. Adam Smith, wrote The Wealth of Nations in the 18th century as an argument in favour of free trade, against just such mercantilism.\n\nMercantilism goes back at least to the 16th century. So, given that we are in the 21st, we should call today’s version “neo-mercantilism”, replacing “neoliberalism” which took a more Smithian view of trade a few decades ago. Yet as the Canadian economist, Eric Helleiner argues, such contemporary neo-mercantilism partly revives earlier neo-mercantilist ideas, notably those of two figures whose ideas were influential in the 19th century — the first US secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton and the German political theorist Friedrich List, both of whom argued for infant industry protection.\n\nNeo-mercantilism is thriving in China, which has not only embraced infant-industry promotion, but created huge trade surpluses. Trump’s US is no less neo-mercantilist: he is obsessed with the evils of external deficits and the need to protect domestic markets.\n\nArvind Subramanian, former chief economic adviser to India’s prime minister Narendra Modi, recently argued that “Trump’s long-standing tariff obsession derives from his fury-fuelled conviction that trade surpluses abroad have damaged the US economy, especially its manufacturing sector. In that world view, China, with its consistently large trade surpluses, was the provocateur-in-chief.”\n\nMy colleague, Robin Harding, has raised even more disturbing worries about China: the Chinese, he suggests, do not want to import anything manufactured elsewhere. Their aim, he argues, is domination of global manufacturing.\n\nThis perspective is consistent with the revealed preferences of Chinese policymakers over decades. Certainly, China has never addressed its long-standing structural problem of excess savings. True, immediately after the financial crisis of 2007-09, its temporary “solution” was to promote a huge domestic property boom. But this has now (inevitably) blown up. More recently, the favoured solution has been enormous investment in advanced manufacturing, which generates excess capacity and even higher exports: China’s mercantilism is embedded, economically and politically.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will now divert China’s exports towards other markets, both other high-income economies and emerging and developing ones. Thus, Subramanian notes that “China’s exports of low-value-added goods to developing countries have been rising sharply, undermining the competitiveness of these countries’ own domestic industries.” The beggar-our-neighbours interaction of China’s mercantilism with US protectionism will spread damage across the world.\n\nMercantilism’s zero-sum and state-oriented perspective also tends to create international conflict. Mercantilist powers fought one another constantly: England and France, two of Europe’s great powers, were at war, on and off, from 1689 to 1815. The apparently economically-motivated US decapitation of Venezuela is a classically imperialist resource-grab. Maybe, the fear of nuclear weapons will continue to constrain war. But it is not easy to separate intense economic friction from outright conflict.\n\nThe triumph of neo-mercantilism then raises two fundamental issues.\n\nThe first is where it will lead. Some argue that the world will fracture. This seems likely. But it is unlikely to be a neat fracturing, because the interests of great powers overlap. It seems unlikely, for example, that the US will just abandon south and east Asia to China.\n\nAgain, in the mercantilist era, there was agreement that gold was a politically neutral form of money. Today, the world’s money (like it or not) consists of national fiat currencies, predominantly the dollar. Replacing it would be very messy. Above all, today’s world economy is more integrated, on almost all dimensions, than any that existed in previous eras. The costs of fracturing are likely to be correspondingly high, especially for small and vulnerable countries.\n\nThe second question is whether the fracturing can be managed. There is, in fact, an answer that is rational, albeit optimistic. It is to build a new system around the notion of a peace treaty among mercantilists. Surprisingly, perhaps, that would not be a new idea: just such a peace treaty was an important element in the post-second-world-war liberal settlement that China and Trump’s US are jointly destroying.\n\nThus, the underlying principle of trade negotiations in 1947’s General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs was reciprocal liberalisation: you lower your barriers to my exporters and, in return, I will lower mine to yours. This is far from the economists’ case for unilateral liberalisation. But it worked rather well, especially in combination with the more liberal principles of non-discrimination and national treatment.\n\nThus, one could imagine an effort (albeit not under Trump) to design a new multilateral economic treaty. In the process, one could even include something John Maynard Keynes wanted to achieve at Bretton Woods, namely, a way to combat huge structural trade surpluses. These, he believed, imposed ruinous constraints upon others. In the 1940s he could not persuade the US, then a huge surplus country. Today, not only the US, but perhaps the Chinese, too, might see that its mercantilism creates serious macroeconomic and microeconomic difficulties.\n\nNeo-mercantilism is a reality. But it needs to be managed. Policymakers need to respond imaginatively.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:05 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-19T05:49:28.356173"}

Al Marri also highlighted strong foreign investment inflows and the expanding role of tourism as central to the country’s economic resilience. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nHow do you think this setup is for this year? Well, looking at the global economy and the fragmentation that's happening and the geopolitical shifts that's happening when it comes to tariffs and trade wars, there's always an opportunity. And the U.S. economist model has weathered the last 4 to 5 years. And a lot of these storms and the basic part of the economic model that we have is resilience. So it comes to diversification. Yeah, there is economy diversification. Today is about two thirds and about three quarters of to 75 to 77% of the U.S. GDP is non-oil and is growing. Five years ago, it was about 69%. So we are growing between two four, 4 to 5% expected this year, 2025 and 2026. We have a growth of 5% as well, non-oil GDP. This shows that the UAE have the economy has more to do in offering cooperation, in dialogue and finding new areas for investments. And that's something which we are always keen on doing. It's interesting you say the word dialogue because you know that the theme for the forum this year is the spirit of dialogue. But at the same time, there has been a lot of headwinds to multilateralism. You have a U.S. president who will be coming here and making a big speech on Wednesday, but his approach has been one, to tear up the existing playbook and really to challenge the norms that have existed with these multilateral institutions. What place is there, do you think, as an economy minister for multilateralism in today's world was very important to the U.S. economy? We always look at the multilateralism as a key, important aspects to really have that dialogue, to really converge. We speak in the G-20, in the BRICS and others as well in the U.N. institutions, from tourism, from trade organizations. That's something which is important to really bring that dialogue and really speak about, you know, weathering the kind of challenges that's happening that we've seen in the global economy that has a lot of elections happening this year. We're going to see a lot of industrialization policies, protectionism. But we need to weather this as well and need to have diversification as part of the economy. And this is the kind of resilience model that we have. Now, let me explain a couple of things that we've been doing in the UAE, more specific. One was very recently we've changed the UAE company commission law changed about 15 articles in it. It has today introduced 15 types of share types that you can introduce to to a limited liability company. For instance, you can start a non-for-profit company, for instance, in the UAE. You can move from emirate to free zone, free zone to any Emirates Emirate, Abu Dhabi to Dubai Company without diluting the company and starting up again and losing all the financial history of the such companies. So movement as well makes it more easier as well for the UAE. So this kind of thing, legal changes that happened in the law itself just 30 days ago have really included as well the kind of growth that we're looking at, looking at 10 to 15% growth in company registration just from that changes. Yeah. Let me pick you up on one thing before we talk about the ease of doing business in the UAE. The UAE trades with Iran. UAE has economic relationships with with Russia. And I wonder whether you think about the economic consequences of that simply because, again, you have a US president who thinks about weaponizing the economy. He's even spoken about a potential 15% tariff on the UAE because they still trade with Iran. So you think about that in the in the whole aspect of that. Oh, that you use economic models really based on trade, based on the economy, based on investment. We we look at resilience, we look at diversification. UAE have attracted about 40 to $42 billion worth of FDI inflow into the into the UAE. We've grown from 19,000,000,003 years ago up to 20, 30, $40 billion worth of FDI from the UAE. So it has been an attractive magnet in the region as well for investments to come in the UAE, to look at the UAE opportunity. We've seen the growth of companies from five years ago, from 600,000 registered to now 1.4 million, and we are expecting to reach 2 to 2 million company registered in the UAE the next couple of 6 to 7 years. But that's kind of the growth I belief in the US vision that even the US economic model believes in the kind of aspect that the view is do something right. And I think the more important aspect is from, like I said, the company logo to the CPA signings to the reform into the immigration policies. The golden visas, for instance, have really transformed that. And tourism is of course, tourism today represents about 15% of the US economy, GDP, and that's when we show that you can go as well, more than 17 to 18% of that. And tourism today, the occupancy rate in UAE hotels goes up to 78% year on year. That's one of the highest in the world. Yeah, I'm sure you've heard of Ray Dalio see this before, but he's several times mentioned that in his view, the UAE is a renaissance country or the Abu Dhabi's a renaissance states, right? He tends to use that term quite a lot. And when you talk about ease of doing business, I mean, there is a reason that lots of asset managers, companies, financial institutions. Have chosen to relocate or to establish offices in the UAE because of that ease of doing business. What do you think enables the system to get this type, this this type of decision making through in an efficient and timely manner? Because it probably is a model that many countries around the world are looking at and saying, we'd love to do the same as well. Well, this goes, you know, took down from the leadership. Today we have the leadership wants the UAE to be 24. Seven operates like an INC incorporation. There is government today was needs to provide services, you know, to to everybody 2424, seven. Today. I, for instance, is still in the US economy and it isn't the government as well to use in doing services and providing services, becoming more efficient and efficient. You know, we have in the UAE colleagues, Excellency among them are the minister of the I forces. You know, he has a programming agenda to really incorporate that even within the US government as well. So when you look at the model of the UAE, we need to make sure that we improve our services, create kind of out of ease of doing business into it. Now, there are two things in an economy. One is the ease of doing business. The other one is intellectual property, the innovation capacity that the UAE creates as well. Now, any businesses today? Yes, they wanted the capacity to really go forward, but the innovation capacity is important. So we looked at the innovation from an IP, for instance, intellectual property, the registration. Now, today in the UAE, we have fast track that comes up to six months. If you have a green IP and intellectual property, those with the green technology can go even farther, faster than three months registration. The UAE, the UAE today looks at the IP as well, ease of registering intellectual property as fast as possible, as well as opening businesses. And this goes hand in hand as well. Earlier on in the interview, you said that two thirds of the UAE economy is now non oil and the UAE economy has been growing around four or 5% the last two years, weathering a lot of these storms and global the global environment. What are going to be the biggest drivers of growth for the UAE economy in the next few years? Where is it going to come from? I think there's a lot of a lot of growth. But today we have the the Green innovation district that we have launched very recently for This is an Expo 2020. Yeah. The Expo site, the Green Innovation District today is powered by renewable energy. The UAE today is as well and an important aspect. How can we produce green green products, green industry, green technology, green IP is kind of the hub as well to help the world be more green and to help the other countries as well to reduce their carbon emission. The UAE has the ability to do that. In processing, for instance, we we process aluminium, for instance, but we don't have a bauxite. We process gold, for instance, when all the leaders in the world in gold, but we don't have a gold mine and we process chocolate for so we have the white chocolate, but we don't have a cocoa form. But this is as well as you. Hey has a very strong aspect in processing. Now when it comes to green industrial and more specifically on the critical minerals, because it is a more aspect as well for the future of growth going from copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt, these kind of minerals that really are important for the future of industry. The UAE can have the world in a process, these in green industrial zones and one of them now today is the next was Expo City, which has been launched and going to be provided as well with circularity economy. Let me circle back to where we started, which is trade, global trade. I know a big focus has been the signing of CPA is not necessarily your mandate, you know, the mandate of the trade ministers, Excellency Dr. 30, but I'm curious to hear whether we can expect more is supposed to be signed this year and whether also you see them as a big driver of growth, of course is super. Today is a big driver of our diversification program and the plans that we have set back in 2021. And I think this is an important aspect when we let this kind of in a whole diversification agenda in the UAE for the economic model as well. The CPA had a huge part and we are we're more than 26 to 27. CFS has already been signed. You know, we have, as was others on the negotiation that will come into under the plan as well. So there is more to come and I think it's important to give us any hints on which countries are. REGION Well, depends on the negotiation that goes and how fast it goes, but they will come in very soon to the surface and you'll hear about them, but they are still more come in the pipeline coming through. Okay And just fine. A point on this one with the UAE signing these bilateral trade deals, does it impede the ability for the GCC as a whole to get trade deals, if not at all? The not at all the same. The same negotiation team who works on the sea for the same negotiation on the GC was is is you know, trade today has you know, there are different economic models and everyone has different different needs and requirements. And when it comes to this negotiation, but all of them as well can complement each other on a bigger scale.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:46:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-19T13:03:09.882234"}

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nPlease welcome to the stage Waleed Al Mugabe al-Muhajir, deputy group CEO of Mubadala Investment Company. For a conversation with Bloomberg's Mallika Kapur. Walid, welcome back to Bloomberg House. Thank you. It's great to be here. Thanks for having me. Sure. Last year, Mubadala was one of the most active sovereign wealth funds in the world. Since we're talking so much about air today, I wanted to ask you what proportion of your investments went towards AI and other emerging tech. Monica, thanks. Thanks once again for having me. You know, we're just reflecting back on the Bloomberg partnership. It's been years and years. We're so thankful that you gave us this forum to be able to to talk about what we need to put out there. So 2025 was a great year for Mubadala, knock on wood. So this is close to wood? Yeah, I think maybe here. But I think I think look, it was it was a great year for us because first you have to understand the way that Mubadala deploys capital Mubadala deploys capital through the the kind of four or five main businesses that we have. So if you bear with me, let me just give a give a quick introduction for the folks that don't know. Number one, what is a direct investor? And so what that means is private equity comprises the largest part of that of that capability. And that's that's obviously an engine with its own set of dynamics. And in fact, we have one of the co-leads, one of our co-CEOs sitting right over there at the table, right, right in front of me. In addition to the direct private equity, we also have an infrastructure and real estate business, a private credit book. These are all direct businesses that that we have spent years setting up. And so obviously are part of that kind of deployment engine that you were referring to. We also have an indirect business that complements what we do extremely well. It's called the Abu Dhabi Investment Council. ED And that's a large business for us and that's an allocation business where we work with, you know, the best funds in, in in the world allocate capital in those areas that we think are going to outperform. And the third one, I think, is might surprise some folks that I know is particularly well. We manage money on other folks behalf, so we have GP led businesses. So the first of which is Mubadala Capital, which is now a large alternative asset manager that manages money from 81. I think at last, at last count, 81 different LPs from all around the world. And then we have MDX, which is an and focused third party capital, a capital manager that has now since proved to be quite a large and substantial investor in that space. So we are also seeing a shift towards private capital, towards real assets. And geographically, you know, last year you also talked about Asia-Pacific and emerging markets being an area of importance. Where is Mubadala leaning in right now? So so right now our portfolio is allocated around 41 to 42% is in the United States, and it's in the United States because today, you know, notwithstanding increased fragmentation and a little bit of division around the world, I still think it's one of the best risk reward that that you see that's out there. But at the same time, you know, when I look towards Asia, I see a huge amount of potential. I'll give you an example. And I was I was talking about this a little bit earlier on with some other folks. I mean, look at Korea as an example. Just in the first two weeks of of the new year, their market is already up double digits. Look at how they performed last year. I mean, it's almost a mistake. And it was the number one performing market in the world. So whether it's Japan, South Korea, India, China, it is incredibly important to us. And I see a huge amount of both opportunity and growth. So for us, you know, we're going to keep allocating obviously, to the United States is our single largest destination. But at the same time, there's so much diversity and opportunity that that, you know, you're going to see Asia and Asian allocations increasing quite quickly over time and thematically is going to continue to be important for you this year at the start of 26. Oh, no question is changing. Change the world. So you tell you tell your story. So it's not just about deploying capital and all the names that that you all know and everybody can take a view about whether something is overvalued or not. Yeah, but but where you really realize the true potential of artificial intelligence is when you see it affecting you just from a day to day perspective. In Mubadala today, you know, the way that we make investment decisions is through our investment committee, which I sit on. And so over the last nine months, we have we have booted up. We have created an AI agent. And so an AI investment committee member. Mm hmm. And, you know, it started out, you know, I would say at the level of an associate. So just a kind of kind of a relatively junior, you know, somebody who could do really good summaries. We'd feed in all our investment memos, and then we would come back and tell us whether the valuation spread. You know, the football field was was right or not. But, you know, now it's progressed and it's matured. And so when we talk to it, yes, we don't have to type anymore. We could talk to it and it comes back. It's now playing the counterfactual, which is really interesting. Yeah. And so we tell it to argue against what the team is putting in front of us. And listen, you know, it just gets better and better over time. It's not it's not incredible yet, but it does make you think. And so when I think about it, having having that capability is so transformational. The potential is so clear that, you know, you want you want to be part of not only the innovation, but the increasing productivity that comes from deploying tools like that. So if everything goes right, I see, you know, a rising tide that will bring all ships up. We're also talking about resilience here at Bloomberg House this week. And you recently partnered with Bloomberg Media on a study examining how global investors are reacting to this climate of uncertainty we face these days. I mean, it feels like we're waking up to a new crisis every day. So from your perspective, what strategies help organizations not just survive a crisis but actually come out of it stronger? It's a great question. And, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking and talking about resilience, not only here in Davos, but but I think in other places. Look, let's unpack resilience a little bit because because it means different things to different, different people. I think the way that you put the question makes it almost defensive in the sense that, yes, you want to cushion your portfolio. Right? And so so you want to through diversification, through I think I think risk management, you want to have that defensive posture. And that's a really important element of risk is resilience. But I don't think it's the full story. So for me, you've got to have kind of an offensive element, right, in addition to that kind of defensive part of that. Yeah. So so first, you know, because we're a long term investor, we came to realize that having that long term perspective. Is in and of itself a form of resilience. You're not forced to sell something at the wrong time. Right. So that's number one. Okay. So that's really important. Second, obviously, liquidity plays an incredible role. So you want to make sure that, you know, there's no there's no pullback. So when markets, as they always do, go into that trough, go go into that down cycle. You want to make sure that you have the liquidity and the dry powder to be able to seize the opportunity. And so that is also a form of resilience. That is the offensive form of resilience, at least in the way that we put it together. So for me, it's about putting the defensive elements that we all are familiar with and that come to mind. But thinking through how we could put together some of those offensive things that we could do to make resilience kind of an important element for not only how you structure your portfolio, how you manage risk, how you think about themes going forward, and just define what's important to you. Well, we wish you good luck at the start of 2026 and hope you'll come back to Bloomberg House next year. Thank you so much. Good to see you.

Romaine Bostick here with Katie Greifeld taking you through to that closing bell with a global simulcast. We're joined now by Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. Welcome to our audiences across all of our Bloomberg platforms, television, radio, our partnership with YouTube on yet another chaotic and yet monumental day in U.S. and global financial markets. Markets hanging on every single word coming out of President Trump out there in Davos, Switzerland. Yeah, as he moves around the globe, continuing to control really the narrative, what we keep covering and where the market goes. And you're absolutely right. And I've been looking at something like semiconductors, some really mega outperformance throughout the day. We're looking at the stocks right now up about 3%. Intel is a big reason why. I'm going to talk about one of that. I'm going to talk about why and maybe there is no reason, but they do report what there is. Wow, that's a tease. But we'll talk about it a little bit later on in my gainers. Do do I'm trying to understand, do we call this like is this the return of the taco trade? I think Whisper. Yes. Is that exactly? Yes. Is that exactly what happened? Yes, it's exactly What can we say? Did you see our red headline? What? There's a chicken wing out from this time. The tariffs. I mean, he said he is going to impose tariffs. Then that red headline corn you saw immediately spike in S & P, if you like. Well, to the racist deal. So theoretically, maybe there's some sort of way. But that's but the idea of a framework deal is is like a term that's been used in the past. I mean, you go back to the debate that he had with concepts of a plan last year, like, yeah, you know, concepts of a plan for health care. Exactly. So well, you know, I mean, look and I mean, we make fun of it, but at the end of the day, you know, 24, 36 hours ago, it looks like we were about to, you know, go to war. Well, with Greenland and maybe with all of NATO's and the European Union. And at least for today, it looks like the president has backed off that as he closes out his trip in Davos, Switzerland, heads back to the United States and maybe a bit more of a focus on some of the domestic issues that continue to plague this nation. As for financial markets, a great day all around, recouping some of the losses from yesterday's sell off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average up almost 600 points, or 1.2%. A similar percent move higher for the S & P 500 and the NASDAQ. And the outperformer once again for a 13th straight session. It's the Russell 2000, up 53 points or 2%, even giving you some love today. All right. Let me go back to the S & P 500. What's interesting is earlier in the session, we did see some pressure on most of these names. Right now, we've got 414 names. Yes, I remember that. Was that David Bowie? I know. Under pressure. Yeah. Yeah. It was also covered by my Chemical Romance. And this is a great position now and I don't. A degree of the rights to that guy's remains. Dulcet tones. 414 names in the S & P 500. I think that this is benign to the downside, Katie. Take it away. Let's talk about the circle. It has so much good news today. It is completely green. A perfect score. 11 out of 11 sectors in the S & P 500 finishing in positive territory. Contrarian signal that I'm looking at right there. Find out tomorrow. This is a much different picture than we were looking at 24 hours ago. What's leading in terms of a percent gain is the energy sector higher by about 2.4%. But it was big tech that is adding the most points because that sector higher by about 1%. Your relative underperformer was utilities only higher by about 2/10 of a percent. Consumer staples just a little bit ahead of that. But again, that speaks to this risk on mood Carol. Yeah, absolutely. Speaking of that intel, here we go. I teased it a little bit, kind of pathetically, but here we go. Intel, your number two gainer in the S & P 500, Number one gainer in the NASDAQ 100. Check it out, up almost 12%. That makes sense because I have no idea how that you're going to tell us. Go back to singing, perhaps. Okay. So the highest intraday? No, actually the highest, I think at the close here in about four years, as I mentioned, a top gainer in the major averages. So this one, you know, for such a long time couldn't kind of do anything. Right. We've we've seen quite a bump up. Check this out. It is up, I think about 44% year to date, year to date, what is it, January 21st. So that's pretty remarkable. Gained 84% last year. The company is going to deliver quarterly, quarterly results Thursday. So we'll see whether or not it comes through. It's just been on a tear. So I had to point out a 47% year to date. And even if you go back out to November or something, I mean, you know, they were talking about a 67% rally, but that's a set up into earnings tomorrow. So it raises the question of, like, what do they have to report tomorrow that's actually going to help maintain these gains. Otherwise, just gonna be a lot of people disappointed. And I do feel like that might be the story among some of these companies that have been on a tear. Right. I think we saw a little bit of that with even the banks priced for perfection and then some. Hey, Moderna top in the S & P 500. Bernstein raised the target on the company to 35 from 25 maintain their market perform rating. This too this stock is up more than 60% year to date highest in more than a year. You might recall yesterday that the company's a personalized cancer treatment developed by Moderna and Merck helped prevent the recurrence of high risk skin cancer. Two five years. Some new data at that. So we're keeping an eye on this one. Where are your sunscreen people? Okay. Yeah. Thank you very much. You're welcome. You're, you know, just you're singing. You're full of helpful tips. And this one, I had a cream soda before. Well, you know what goes good with a cream soda? Yeah. A Nathan's famous hot dog. Delicious. Yes. This one rattling up about 8.7% in today's trade. Smithfield Foods said it would acquire Nathan's Famous in a deal valued at about 450 million, securing the rights to a key product in its business's largest segment. They had an exclusive license. So this goes out. But what's interesting, 450 million. Yes, hot dogs. A lot of hot dogs. But what's interesting, I want to know this. So it's connecting this New York icon. My husband loves Nathan's famous. The fries are really good to a company whose Chinese ownership has previously caught the attention of the Trump administration. So Smithfield, based in Virginia, its largest shareholder is Hong Kong meat processor H Group Ltd.. All right. I should go over. Well, I was so close to asking Carol if I could do the gainers today just so I could do the news. He's like, Hey, hey, you got us. Like, You got it. Got to do this one. Tim, Do you like hot dogs? I like I like talking about that. Nathan's is a problem. It's like a publicly traded company. You don't need hot dogs, do you? I do not partake in. Think so. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about stocks that move lower today. I wanna start with Netflix shares fell earlier in the session higher the stock rather more than 2.18%. But with all this buying even Netflix got some buying late in the session this after the company gave a disappointing forecast for earnings due to increased spending on programming its deal for Warner Brothers Discovery. Netflix plans to increase spending on films and TV shows by 10%, and it secured streaming rights to movies from Universal and Sony. Once again, shares finished pretty much at their highs of the session, but still down 2.2%. Also, Kraft Heinz Company, Berkshire Hathaway looking to sell its 28% stake in Kraft Heinz. It's the final step in a separation months in the making. The shares of Kraft Heinz down 5.72%. As a result of that, the move to exit Kraft Heinz comes just 21 days into Greg Abel's tenure at the top of Berkshire Hathaway. It follows a decade long underperformance by the company and finally t one energy many t one energy shares took a hit today, down two point rather 5.6% today. Its small cap. It manufactures solar equipment, solar modules, sells panels, build solar and battery storage fell as much as 15% earlier in the session. This after Culper said it short. The solar equipment maker in a post on ACC shares pared their declines to fall just 5.6%. And I'll just add a quick honorable mention to I'll keep an eye on silo software stocks, which continue to be under pressure. Microsoft Salesforce down software as a service is applovin down for fifth straight day. Meanwhile, we did see a slight drop in yields on the day trying to recoup some of the moves that we saw from yesterday of basically about four basis points on the longer end of the curve, shorter end of the curve, basically not a whole lot happening there. Of course, the big focus today, Carol and Tim really was on a lot of the stuff coming out of Davos and a speech by Trump that was actually supposed to be about affordability. Yeah, that's a little bit about affordability. A little bit about affordability. Yeah. And TBD, I guess. You know, we've heard a lot about windmills. We were talking about that in just a minute. We are. Randi, thank you for that. Have you ever seen a windmill in China? I have only been to Shanghai and there were I didn't remember seeing anywhere, which was that incredible, incredible wind farm in California on the way to like Yosemite. You know what it is? It's incredible. There's just like mile after mile. Yeah. You know, when I was a kid, there was a movie Less than Zero with Robert Downey Jr. And I remember that that great scene where, you know, he overdoses when they're driving out through that windmill farm. Oh, yeah. There you go. Sounds like a trip. All right. Anything else, guys? Swift journeys. Want to do it? Yeah, sure. Why not? I guess we got to do some work here at night. Swift, of course, The big trucking provider are reporting earnings right now. That's crossing the wire here. The company saying revenue came in a slight touch below their average. A street estimates .86 billion. The street was looking for about .9 billion. And EPS also in this year on an adjusted basis, $0.31 a share. The street on average was looking for about $0.35 a share. Be interesting to dive a little bit deeper into this because just a few days ago we were actually talking about a bit of a rebound in the trucking market. Of course, backward looking to the fourth quarter. So maybe it doesn't reflect back just quite yet.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:12:42 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T23:36:34.427811"}

{"title": "Netflix Spending Mounts Amid Warner Deal", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-01-21/netflix-spending-mounts-amid-warner-deal-video", "summary": "Netflix shares tumbled Wednesday after the company issued a disappointing forecast for earnings in the months ahead as it spends more on programming and works to close its $82.7 billion deal with Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. The streaming leader said Tuesday it plans to increase spending on films and TV shows by 10% this year while forging ahead with plans to buy the studio and streaming business of Warner Bros., a deal that would unite two of the world’s largest entertainment companies. Netflix spent about $18 billion on programming last year, with subscribers growing almost 8% to top 325 million. Wedbush Securities Media & Entertainment Equity Research SVP Alicia Reese joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. She speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nYou know, we were talking yesterday before the call about the idea of content spend sending shares lower. And it's like a story that we could have told about Netflix a dozen years ago because this is always, you know, apart from members, I mean, we get that number anymore. That's what in the past has moved the company's stock. Is that what happened this time or is it something different? There are a few different elements here going on. So, you know, Netflix does give the engagement numbers now. And, you know, after not giving subscriber numbers for most of the year, they did give their subscriber numbers, but the subscriber numbers were really where we expected them to be. There is no surprise there. I think, you know, there was some disappointment in how much advertising revenue that Netflix was able to squeeze out of a quarter as big as Q4 when you had, you know, all those life events, including NFL games on Christmas and some boxing matches and, of course, Stranger Things. And you had a lot of, you know, people coming on to the service and a lot more engagement around those events. Netflix should have been able to get some pretty significant advertising revenue. They did get a decent amount. The advertising revenue did grow two and a half times, year by year, and they do expect another doubling in 2016 to about $3 billion. And that's satisfactory. But it's not, you know, exciting just yet. You know, there's still a significant growth opportunity for it for Netflix in advertising. And I think the hurdle so far has been just that they haven't had the data stack and the attribution available for advertisers significant enough for them to really, you know, do all of the campaigns that they would like to do. They have great alternatives right now across social media and other connected TV items. But Netflix is really catching up on this. And I do think that they'll be able to exploit that opportunity in the coming year into a year or two. So advertising being the big surge, Alicia, when it comes to boosting the top line, the revenue line, yeah, I think that's their biggest opportunity in the coming years. 26 is the first year where that's really meaningful. It's a meaningful contributor to its growth opportunity. And I, you know, the $3 billion mark that they set for themselves, they can easily surpass that if they get all of the pieces in place and that excess of content spend or what might look excessive content spend relative to the engagement will look a lot more reasonable if a lot of that engagement is on the end tier. Now they said that they're planning to do some price increases in the year, and I think that's going to be mainly on the premium tiers, trying to urge more of its users over to the advertising tier, which is significantly cheaper if they get a lot of that engagement on that tier and a lot more advertisers in front of them that results in profitability. The $82.7 billion deal for Warner Brothers Discovery predict predict this for us. Does Netflix get these assets? The regulatory process is going to be a long, drawn out and very difficult. Why do you think that in this? In this? Oh, yeah. Well, there's there's two different sides of it. On the one side, there is the consumer side. It's going to be hard for Netflix to argue that, you know, the likes of YouTube that, you know, billions on YouTube are real competitors. You know, you do have some subscribers, but it's a significantly lower portion. And not all media is going to be, you know, considered a competitor if you only have real competitors in there. Netflix does have significant market share who have quite a bit when they have HBO. On the other side, its content as a content buyer. It's going to consolidate power pretty significantly for, you know, against producers of content. And so it'll give Netflix almost too much, you know, collective power against those producers and how much they'll spend on content. So it does diminish somehow some power in Hollywood potentially. And, you know, the prosecutors will be able to argue that at least you've got an outperform. You've had an outperform for a while. I think you've moved around the target price right now. You're looking for about 115 a share on Netflix. So that's some room to the upside. I mean, the stock right now trading just under $85 a share. Is it, though, we just talked about you stressed that the revenue is certainly going to be a big opportunity for this company ad revenue growth, Is that what gets it to the target? Are there other things? Is is it also the completion of the deal? And if that deal doesn't happen, then what? What does the story, the growth story look like for Netflix going forward? Is your ad revenue enough or do they need that deal to help with that growth in the ad revenue? So my price target does not include Warner Brothers at this time, and it won't until the deal closes. Right now, I'm you know, my my assumption is that they're going to just continue operating as Netflix, at least for the next year plus during the regulatory process. So my 150 million price target is one year out, includes only Netflix and its own, you know, internal opportunity with ad revenue growth. And so you know, should that deal go through that will, you know, significantly improve Netflix's ability to leverage its ad stack which by then should be, you know, absolutely booming. So I do think there is a lot of upside opportunity with or without Warner Brothers at this point. Okay. What happens, though, if a competitor gets it? You said there's still a lot of upside, even if. Yeah. Even if content gets more expensive. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that is that is the issue. You know, Netflix has been making a lot of partnerships and content. You know, they made their one with Sony recently. Of course, they have their, you know, content deal with Warner Brothers and they've seen how successful that content library is for Netflix on Netflix. And so owning the content makes a lot of sense. It'll save them a lot of money on those content costs. If somebody else gets the content, could potentially be more expensive. But Netflix buys that content plenty of content from Paramount already. So, you know, it's just a matter of will Netflix continue to spend as much on, you know, procuring content through licensing deals and then producing its own content? And the combination of that in a combination of international content as well? It certainly can. And, you know, it just would be a little bit more profitable, especially if they're able to leverage that content against a global base that that utilizes advertising. Okay. So years ago, Netflix said all we're doing, you know, is is sending DVDs to people and that's our business. Then they, you know, quick stir and the whole spin off and that didn't end up happening. But then they're like, okay, now all we're doing is focusing on on demand streaming. We're never going to do sports. They're never gonna do anything live. They throw that out the window. They're doing everything right now. They're doing advertising this to say, we'd never do advertising. What is left for Netflix to do, at least from a content perspective, if they're doing games, if they're doing sports, if they're doing these live one off events, if they're doing that live, not one off events and getting actually rights to broadcast sports, if they're if they're doing podcasts, what's left? Yeah, I mean, there's a lot left in terms of gaming, cloud gaming, they have a really big opportunity. There is cloud gaming becomes more pervasive, unconnected TVs. They have a good opportunity just given their global base and the number of gamers out there, they can do a lot with that. I think they can become a really important platform for gaming, you know, similar to, you know, some of the consoles, they can operate a such, you know, licensing and a lot of really quality, you know, high quality gaming content and then leveraging their own IP as they see fit. You know, there are a lot of other opportunities in sports. To your point, they don't have to you know, they can do one off events. They can do, you know, WWE, which has been really successful for them. They're going to do, you know, the baseball in Japan? I think that's a really important step for them. And it doesn't have to be global. It can be localized. They can also leverage their global base to bring sports that are not big in certain regions to those regions and, you know, create a larger fan base around the world. You know, take Gaelic football to the U.S., for instance. You know, that could work. There are a lot of different opportunities within those, I think podcasts. You know, the the whole idea is to have content that will appeal to every one of their subscriber households and keep everyone engaged. And however they need to do that is what they're going to do.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:55:12 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T23:36:35.448739"}

MacGregor says energy security is 'top of mind' around the world and Engie will be 'patient' when it comes to potential future acquisitions. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nThere's been a lot going on in Davos, but frankly, since January 1st, there's been a lot. Overall, Venezuela concerns over Iran than the tariffs that yesterday Donald Trump said he would impose on Greenland. What does it mean for big utility company like energy? It's a good morning from. So for us. Indeed. Uncertainty fluidity like we've rarely experienced before. What's quite interesting for a company like us is the fact that energy is top of minds. And by energy I mean energy security. So as we talked a lot about energy transition, we look we talked a lot more about climate. Before climate. We talk a little bit less before, even though now, even though it's still very important, it's really about energy security. And so it has a lot of consequences for us for a company like energy. Energy security, In what way? Energy Step of minds. Every country, not just every region, every country wants to ensure a higher degree of sovereignty when it comes to energy. So it's can I depend more on myself? And that's obviously turns into an opportunity for a company like Energy. As you know, we are very engaged in energy transition, but some might call it energy addition, because energy demand remains very strong. And so for companies is how do I meet this energy demand, which is growing but relying more on myself. And this is where it gets really interesting, because renewables is indeed a very important part of the answer. And as you know, and is very engaged in renewables development. So this is where we have very interesting discussions with most of our stakeholders. Under your leadership, there's been quite a lot of divestments for energy or is there anything that you're looking to buy now? So we have a very clear strategy at Energy, which is really a growth on two pillars. One is around generation of smart electrons. So it's renewables is storage, flexible assets that we tend to do more organically. We have an objective of 95 gigawatts, so we had a 50. So it's still a lot of growth to 2030. And then the second pillar of growth is infrastructure. Because we are a utility, we like to have regulated assets, infrastructure, and for that pillar we will be looking potentially at external growth. And we've said that in the past. But always keeping in mind, you know, capital discipline, of course, because we want to create value with energy. That's very important. And in spite of the contract we have with our stakeholders, including our investors, of course. So how are valuations looking at the moment? Well, obviously infrastructure assets are scarce when they are of quality, But, you know, we'll be looking at it and we would be patient, Francine. So we'll take the time to make sure that we look at what's available and and we have some time to deliver on that strategy because of the critical this actually of your industry and the fact that, as you say, there's a lot more sovereignty involved. It feels like, you know, I don't know if it's an arms race, but certainly people and countries want more control of their supply chain and their critical industries. Do you think there will be a kind of race for more M & A or to become bigger? I don't know necessarily whether it's an imminent topic. I think it's for sure making sure that every country develops the right energy system for its own situation. And this is what's really interesting about what's happening today, is that it's not just that we're looking at regionalization is really every country itself is trying to develop better sovereignty. And so they'll be looking at generation, what is the right mix. And then, of course, indeed, infrastructure, a lot of capital needed to reinforce grids as electrification is underway, as you know. And so we would be looking to be part of that only in the countries where we are already operating, where we have presence, because obviously we don't want to be everywhere. So we are remain quite focused geographically. Talk to me a little bit about France. There is quite a lot of political uncertainty still there. You know, questions about taxes. How does it impact your investments in the country? So, you know, France is a big country for us. We are historical operator. We operate the gas infrastructures and we are we always have this asks to our government that we would like to have stability, security on the fiscal front. But France is important country and that won't change any time soon. I think budget needs to be passed and we look forward to more stability as as we have also enjoying to some extent in Europe, you know, stability is sometimes a bit relative. And when we look at France and Europe, actually we can find source of hope by looking at the stability, the fact that the energy transition remains very important on the agenda, decarbonisation and the need to invest in renewables, in infrastructure that is still there in Europe. And we see that as a as a positive, as an investment of. But in terms of tax increases, does it actually change anything for for how much capital you have to put into new for a company like us? You know, the tax element that is being discussed in France, we can live with it. We don't like it, but we can live with it. It's not going to really change, know our plans. But I think what's important is also for the rest of the economy, the stability is needed to make sure that it continues and industry thrives. And of course, these are customers. So it's very important also that there is this framework of stabilization that is offered for industry to thrive in France and in Europe. And that's good for us as well. And General Greg, how difficult or different was this Davos? There seems to be a feeling amongst European, some European CEOs that they were being pushed around by the US. I know the president of the United States and walked it down some of the comments, but it is a mood very different to previous years. Yeah, the mood is bizarre. I was really surprised this Davos as the mood is bizarre. And on the other hand, you know, when it comes to the energy world, again, you know, I go back to my first comment, energy is so top of mind. So when you you feel that you're really doing something important for the different country where you operate. And that's really what I will retain from from from the situation here.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:09:42 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-22T07:33:40.554194"}

She says Europe's adversaries enjoy seeing \"spats\" between allies. She says Europe is seeking stability with the US. She speaks to Bloomberg's Scarlet Fu. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nI want to start with this, a framework deal between President Trump and NATO's secretary general, Mark Ruiter. What might the framework of a deal look like, as alluded to by Trump and based on what you've heard? Of course, we haven't seen the agreements, but of course we can only speculate what is in the mandate of the secretary general of NATO to talk about this, the security of the Arctic, and that is what has been offered before. If the United States has worries about the security of the Arctic, considering the importance of the region, then these issues can be addressed by NATO. Is Europe comfortable with Margarita, the secretary general? NATO's negotiating on Denmark's behalf. Security issues can be, of course, discussed in NATO. What I see, you know, a new mission, whether it's some kind of activity from the outside. But of course, also all the needs of members need to agree. But when it comes to territorial integrity, sovereignty of of Greenland or Denmark, when it comes to critical raw materials, then of course, these are issues that Denmark and Greenland should discuss about. Right. The reporting shows right now that NATO's will beef up security in the region to prevent encroachment by Russia or China. The US would get mining rights and the ability to station missiles there. What is your confidence, Kaiya, that this is enough for President Trump that he won't press further for sovereignty of Greenland? One thing we have learned over this year is that we have to be prepared for the unpredictability. So nothing is really clear, even if there are agreements made. So I think this is what we have learned and what we need to also prepare. We need to have plans ready for different scenarios. And and that is what we are working on. And of course, what I also want to stress is that, you know, when there are spats like this going on between allies, then, of course, our adversaries are really enjoying the show of it from the Europeans perspective. And I realize this might be a very basic question Why is it critical keeping Greenland under Danish sovereignty as opposed to the US? Because the Greenlandic people, you know, have said that they want to be with the European Union, they want to be with Denmark. And that's why, you know, the future of Greenland is up to the Greenland re lenders to decide. And that's why we are, of course, supporting the territorial integrity sovereignty, but also the right for the Greenlandic people to choose. Now, in response to President Trump's threats to take Greenland. Europe decided to freeze its trade deal with the US. Could you give us some color into that status of that trade deal? Is it completely dead in the water? Is it on pause? What would it take for Europe to take it up again to move forward on it? Last two days I've spent in the European Parliament and really, where are all the members elected in all the member states of of Europe and really saying and voicing their concerns about this, the trade deal that was done in the summer. The argument behind it was that at least, you know, our companies need a security, need some kind of stability. You know, any deal is better than no deal. And there's unpredictability. What we have seen, of course, now over the last few days is that this stability might not be there. And that's why the European Parliament that is representing the European nations is also voicing concerns and has stopped this process because. So what kind of guarantees there are really from this deal? Of course, we know also Vladimir Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, ended up attending Davos because he flew there to have a meeting with President Trump. And while there, he has accused European allies of failing to halt Russia's actions, lacking the will to act as a real global power. What are the next steps for Ukraine? As most of the attention seems to be focused on Greenland right now? Well, exactly. I mean, the real issue is Ukraine right now. And that's why, you know, any kind of disagreements that we have between allies, our adversaries like Russia and China, are really enjoying this this show. And that's why we really need to focus on on what is the real risk right now. If, you know, United States is worried about security and they're worried about what Russia might do, then we should be united in also response to Russia. In Ukraine, what we have seen, we have seen a diplomatic push for peace. We have seen concessions from Ukrainian side. Well, we haven't seen is Russia to make any moves or showing any signs of wanting peace? The opposite. They have increased their attacks against the civilians, civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. So we really need to put the focus where it should be. I also want to ask you about India and Europe, because we know that Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, has spent his time at Davos talking about how middle powers need to do more to form their own alliances. And we've seen how EU and India are strengthening ties. You announced the signing of a new security and defence partnership this week. Talk a little bit about how that paves the way for a trade deal as well. What are the guiding principles here for Europe to get a trade deal signed in a timely manner? While, you know, others are really taking down the bridges than we are trying to build bridges with our partners all across the world. And we see the appetite also all across the world to build partnerships with the European Union, whether it's, you know, Mercosur, whether it's India, whether these are other countries to really diversify the trade portfolios that we have to in order to be also stronger and more independent. That is why we are also discussing the free trade agreement with India. We are also discussing the security and defence partnership with India. How can we build, you know, these partnerships in order to really step up to the threats that we have? I hate to bring it back to President Trump, but he spent a good chunk of yesterday's speech in Davos insulting Europe, casting the continent as as weak, as utterly dependent on the US. Whether we're talking about security or economics, the markets is a reflection in Europe on that kind of assessment from the president. It is clear that the transatlantic relationship is not the same as it was a year ago. But Europe is not willing to junk 80 years of good relations for disagreements at the same time. We need to be also more self-confident in our actions. And and again, you know, we are strong when we are united and acting in a unified manner, whether it's a question of economic security when we are attacked or when when it's a question about the real security and defense that we are building. So so, yes, a lot of criticism. And, you know, Europe as a continent has been also very self-critical, and that also is a basis for the progress.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:05:33 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-22T20:35:55.518379"}

There have also been investor concerns over the multibillion-dollar race to build AI infrastructure, including a series of debt-fuelled deals that rely on usage of the technology to keep growing.\n\nHassabis said demand for AI across Google’s products, such as its latest Gemini 3 model, was stronger than ever, insisting it would prove to be “the most transformative technology probably ever invented”.\n\n\n\n“If the bubble bursts we will be fine,” he said. “We’ve got an amazing business that we can add AI features to and get more productivity out of.”\n\nLast year, Google rebounded from a difficult period since the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022. Its AI models now surpass the performance of its smaller rival and the search giant is closing the gap in chatbot users.\n\nThe momentum has driven parent company Alphabet’s valuation past $4tn, making it the second-largest company in the world after chipmaker Nvidia.\n\n\n\nHassabis also argued western companies still have a lead against China on AI development.\n\n\n\nAbout a year ago Chinese group DeepSeek surprised Silicon Valley by developing a powerful and free-to-access AI model for a fraction of the price of its American competitors. The release also shook US public markets, where there is a heavy concentration of capital in Big Tech stocks.\n\nHassabis said there had been “overreaction in the west” to DeepSeek, arguing “the Chinese labs haven’t proven they can innovate beyond the frontier yet”. He said US tech companies still had a lead of “six months or so”.\n\nHowever, in the past year, China has invested heavily in developing leading models that can be freely used by developers in applications, leapfrogging American rivals in “open” AI development.\n\nHassabis admitted Chinese companies were “more focused on the near-term applications”, in the hunt for immediate revenues “rather than maybe these more research-heavy frontier capabilities” required to achieve artificial general intelligence — or machines that can surpass human abilities. That remains the lofty goal of US-backed groups such as DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\n\n\nDebate at Davos also centred on the growing risks and harms around AI.\n\n\n\nIn recent months, OpenAI was hit by lawsuits over claims its chatbot had encouraged young people to commit suicide. Elon Musk’s xAI was heavily criticised after it emerged its Grok chatbot had been used to generate sexualised images of women and children.\n\n\n\nHassabis said it was imperative to focus on safe and responsible AI development, and for the AI industry to show the general public what AI’s benefits are.\n\n\n\n“For us, that’s doubling down on our AI for science and AI for medicine work and things like that, which are kind of unequivocal goods in the world,” he said.\n\nThe DeepMind co-founder also said Google’s AI models could help the Big Tech group realise its long-held vision of smart glasses. The company first introduced smart glasses over a decade ago, but the devices were widely derided and failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n\n\nLast year, Google announced partnerships with fashion groups such as Warby Parker seeking to introduce new AI-infused spectacles for consumers.\n\n“Maybe we were a bit too ahead of our time when we first started this 10-plus years ago at Google with the devices,” Hassabis admitted. “What was missing was a killer app for that.

{"title": "Democrats unite to threaten shutdown over immigration raids", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/fbe5cd7c-e1dd-4e25-b09f-69a76b5b16a3", "summary": "Party which has struggled to oppose Donald Trump’s agenda says it is prepared to take a stand over Minneapolis deaths", "content": "Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world\n\nAfter often struggling to form an effective opposition to Donald Trump, Democrats this weekend found an issue on which they could unite — threatening to shut the government over the US president’s immigration crackdown.\n\nSenators have been loath to risk another costly government closure, fearing a backlash if thousands of federal workers were furloughed and public services ground to a halt just months after the previous shutdown.\n\nBut the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents on Saturday has changed their calculation.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers now say they will not support legislation that includes funds for the Department of Homeland Security until federal immigration agents are reined in. That leaves Congress with just days to hash out an agreement before a government funding deadline on Friday, January 30.\n\nPretti’s death at the hands of Border Patrol officers was the second fatal shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis this month, after poet Renée Nicole Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in her car two weeks ago.\n\n“I’m not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating. Democrats are not going to fund that,” said Adam Schiff, a Democrat senator from California on Sunday.\n\n“The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nEarlier in the week, Patty Murray, the Democratic senator from Washington state, said a shutdown would not do anything to “restrain” ICE.\n\nBut after Pretti’s killing, Murray changed her stance.\n\n“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences. I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” she posted on X.\n\nAny government funding bill needs the support of 60 senators to avert a shutdown. Republicans control the Senate, 53-47, meaning that at least seven Democratic senators would need to sign on to a Republican-supported funding plan in order for the government to remain open.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat, said late on Saturday that his party had the votes to block any legislation that provides more federal money to ICE.\n\n“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling — and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said. “Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.”\n\nOn Sunday Schumer called on Senate Republicans to draft legislation to keep the government open while carving out a separate bill to rewrite funding for the DHS.\n\n“Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,” he said. “This is the best course of action, and the American people are on our side.”\n\nJohn Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, did not immediately respond to Schumer’s request.\n\nSenate Democrats were due to hold a call on Sunday evening to discuss their strategy for the funding fight. Lawmakers are not expected to return to Washington until at least Tuesday, following a hazardous storm on the East Coast.\n\nRepublicans and federal authorities continue to insist that agents were acting in self-defence when they shot Pretti, despite video footage that contradicted that position.\n\nProtests have spread across the county, with some demonstrators calling for the abolition of ICE, the agency that has been on the frontline of the crackdown.\n\nFormer Democratic president Barack Obama made a rare intervention in US politics on Sunday, calling the shooting of Alex Pretti a “wake-up call” for the nation.\n\n“For weeks now, people across the country have been rightly outraged by the spectacle of masked ICE recruits and other federal agents acting with impunity and engaging in tactics that seem designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city,” the former president and first lady Michelle Obama said in a statement.\n\n“These unprecedented tactics . . . have now resulted in the fatal shootings of two US citizens. And yet rather than trying to impose some semblance of discipline and accountability over the agents they’ve deployed, the president and current administration officials seem eager to escalate the situation, while offering public explanations for the shootings of Mr Pretti and Renée Good that aren’t informed by any serious investigation — and that appear to be directly contradicted by video evidence.”\n\nThe shooting could equally be seen as a watershed moment for Democrats, who have been accused of being ineffectual in the face of the Trump administration’s aggressive tactics while their voters have become more upset with the status quo.\n\nThere is evidence that Trump too is under pressure over the issue. A New York Times Siena poll this week found just 36 per cent of voters approved of how ICE was doing its job, while 63 per cent disapproved, including 70 per cent of independent voters. Almost one in five Republicans said ICE had “gone too far”.\n\nThe last government shutdown — which stretched from October 1 to November 12 of last year — was the longest in US history. It ended only when a handful of Democratic senators crossed the political aisle in a move that divided the party, with many lawmakers accusing their colleagues of surrendering to Trump and the Republicans.\n\nBut Democrats were near-unanimous in expressing outrage over events in Minneapolis on Saturday, along with their willingness to shut down the government over the issue.\n\nCatherine Cortez Masto, Jacky Rosen, Brian Schatz — all Democrats who helped break the stalemate last November — were quick to say they would not vote in favour of a funding package that included money for the DHS. Other moderates were sharply critical of the agency even as they stopped short of saying how they intended to vote.\n\nAngus King, an independent senator from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats and also broke the November stalemate, told CBS News on Sunday: “I hate shutdowns. I’m one of the people who helped negotiate the solution to end the last shutdown. But I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under the circumstances.” ICE has recently ramped up its deportation efforts in Maine.\n\nJeanne Shaheen, the New Hampshire Democrat who led negotiations to end the last shutdown, said federal officers were “out of control”.\n\n“There is a reason why we need to raise concerns about what the Department of Homeland Security is doing and how their federal agents are operating,” she told Fox News on Sunday, without saying how she planned to vote.\n\nWith a budget of $85bn, ICE has become the best-funded US law enforcement agency, outstripping the FBI. Its funding received a boost in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill legislation last year.\n\n“Before us right now we have a bill about funding them, giving them more money. I’m not voting for that,” said Minnesota senator and gubernatorial candidate Amy Klobuchar on Sunday.\n\n“Law enforcement is based on trust. And we have had a total breakdown of trust.”", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://www.ft.com/rss/home", "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 21:16:38 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-25T21:25:20.324818"}

WHAT WE’RE LOOKING AT HEREBY IN THE EQUITY MARKETS IS THAT ROTATION FROM MEGA CAP TECH TO THE REST OF THE MARKET SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED, AT LEAST FOR NOW. YOU CAN SEE THE NASDAQ 100 LEADING THE WAY AMONG EQUITY INDEXES, GAINING .9%. THERE IS, OF COURSE, SOME BIG LOSSES IN HEALTH INSURERS, WHICH WE’LL GET TO LATER ON, THAT IS WEIGHING ON THE BROADER MARKETS. CLEARLY THE NASDAQ 100, THE OUTPERFORMER BEFORE FOUR OF THE MAG 7 NAMES REPORT EARNINGS LATER THIS WEEK. THE BLOOMBERG DOLLAR INDEX NOW AT A NEW FOUR-YEAR LOW. THE DOLLAR IS WEAKER VERSUS ALL 16 MAJOR CURRENCIES. THE YEN TOUCHING A TWO YEAR HIGH. THE BIG PERFORMER HERE, NOT JUST TODAY, BUT ALL WEEK LONG, ALL YEAR LONG, HAS BEEN SILVER. IT CONTINUES TO RIP HIGHER ON MASSIVE VOLUME, WHAT IS DRIVING THIS RALLY IS DEMAND FROM CHINA, AS WELL AS A SHORT SQUEEZE. NASDAQ FUTURES MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, RETREATING IN THIN TRADING BEFORE THE FRONT MO CONTRACT EXPIRES TOMORROW. THIS FOLLOWS A BLISTERING FIVE-DAY RALLY WHERE PRICES MORE THAN DOUBLED. PERHAPS THE WARMER WEATHER FORECASTS, OR LESS COLD FORECAST IN TEXAS, LOUISIANA THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY IS HELPING TO BRING THAT FUTURE DOWN JUST A BIT. LET’S GET TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MOVERS RIGHT NOW AND BRING IN EMILY WITH MORE. EMILY: LET’S GO RIGHT TO THOSE HEALTH INSURERS, BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING MASSIVE DECLINES HERE IN A COUPLE OF THESE NAMES. UNITED HEALTHCARE DOWN AND HUMANA DOWN 20%. A LOT OF THIS ACTION COMING AFTER UNITED HEALTH TODAY FORECASTED A DECLINE IN 2026 REVENUE, THE FIRST ANNUAL CONTRACTION IN MORE THAN THREE DECADES FOR THE COMPANY, AS THE INSURER FALTERS IN ITS ATTEMPT TO REBUILD CONFIDENCE WITH INVESTORS AFTER A STUNNING FALL LAST YEAR. THIS IS JUST THE SECOND BLOW TO UNITED AND ALSO HERE NEWS THAT’S WEIGHING ON BOTH CVS HEALTH AND HUMANA, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S POLICY PROPOSAL JUST YESTERDAY ANNOUNCING A SMALLER THAN EXPECTED INCREASE TO PAYMENTS TO SOME INSURERS. LET’S LOOK AT THE BOARD AND TAKE A LOOK AT SHARES OF U.P.S. THIS STOCK IS IN THE GREEN, IT’S UP ABOUT 3.6%. THE COMPANY DID SAY THAT THEY EXPECT TO CUT AS MANY AS 30,000 POSITIONS THIS YEAR. IT’S PART OF AN ONGOING EFFORT BY THE DELIVERY COMPANY TO REIN IN COSTS, BOOST PROFITABILITY. THEY ALSO REPORTED EARNINGS, FULL-YEAR REVENUE FORECAST TOPPING ESTIMATES. RIGHT NOW, SHAREHOLDERS AGREEING WITH THIS MOVE TO CUT JOBS HERE. AND THEN FINALLY WATCHING SHARES OF GENERAL MOTORS. THE AUTO COMPANY GAINING, THEY ISSUED A STRONG PROFIT FORECAST IN THEIR EARNINGS. THEY EXPECT PROFITS TO GROW AS MUCH AS $2 BILLION THIS YEAR, AND THEY PLAN TO RETURN MORE OF THAT TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH A HIGHER I HAVE DID DEFEND AND STOCK BUYBACK PLAN. ANALYSTS COVERING THE STOCK ARE PRETTY MUCH UNANIMOUSLY POSITIVE ON THIS NEWS, JUST GETTING A VOICE HERE FROM ONE PIPER SANDLER, THEY SAID G.M. IS EXECUTING AT A HIGH LEVEL. THEY HAVE AN OVERWEIGHT RATING ON THE STOCK. THEY SAID THE COMPANY HAS REUPPED ITS BUYBACK AUTHORIZATION DESPITE FEARS THAT E.V. CHARGES WOULD IMPACT THE PACE OF REPURCHASES, THAT PACE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE SLOWING. THE STOCK UP 8%. SCARLET: THANK YOU SO MUCH, EMILY. LET’S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT’S GOING ON WITH THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH CONTINUES TO PLUMB NEW FOUR-YEAR LOWS. THERE’S SPECULATION OF JAPAN INTERVENING TO SUPPORT THE YEN. JOINING US TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CONTEXT AROUND ALL OF THIS IS THE GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITI RESEARCH. HE’S ALSO A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AT DALLAS, ACADEMIC ADVISORY COUNCIL SPECIFICALLY. NATHAN, IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SPEAK WITH YOU. DOLLAR DISBASEMENT IS A THEME IN THE MARKETS THIS WEEK. THERE’S BEEN HUGE TURNOVER IN G10 CURRENCY OPTIONS. A CONVENIENT EXPLANATION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THAT U.S. RISKS ARE GROWING, WHETHER IT’S UNPREDICTABLE POLICY OR THE CONTINUED GROWING BUDGET DEFICIT, FISCAL PROPHECY. YET YOU LOOK AT OTHER U.S. ASSETS, LIKE EQUITIES MOVING HIGHER. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS TURN AGAINST THE DOLLAR? > > IT’S A GREAT QUESTION, AND I HAVE SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS MYSELF. I THINK THE GEOPOLITICAL/POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT REAR IN, AND BEYOND GOING EVOLUTION IN SOME CASES, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT U.S. POLICIES IS VERY MUCH IN PLAY AS WE THINK ABOUT THE SOFTENING OF THE DOLLAR. ALSO AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED THE THREATS OF INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT THE GENERAL, MAYBE A BETTER IMPROVED SENTIMENT REGARDING THE YEN IS ALSO IN PLAY. BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE AN OVERALL AN ENVIRONMENT THAT’S TRENDING TOWARD A SOFTER DOLLAR. FINALLY TO RECONCILE THE SOFTER DOLLAR ON THE ONE HAND, WITH THE BETTER PERFORMANCE OF U.S. EQUITY MARKETS, I THINK WE SAW THIS LAST YEAR AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FOREIGN INVESTORS IN PARTICULAR WHO ARE NOT COMFORTABLE SELLING THEIR U.S. POSITIONS AND EXTINGUISHING THOSE POSITIONS. WHAT THEY DO IS THEY HEDGE THE DOLLAR EXPOSURE IN THE F.X. MARKET. I THINK WE’RE PROBABLY SEEING MORE OF THAT, WHICH IS A PLAY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW THROUGH MUCH OF 2025. SCARLET: OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMES TO POTENTIAL INTERVENTION IN THE YEN, THERE WAS HUGE NEWS, AT LEAST FOR THE CURRENCY MARKET LAST WEEK, WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE NEW YORK FED SPECIFICALLY, REPORTEDLY DID A RATE CHECK OF THE DOLLAR-YEN, WHICH BASICALLY ASKING FOR A QUOTE ON DOLLAR-YEN, WHICH TRIGGERED SPECULATION THAT THE U.S. AND JAPAN WOULD COMBINE, THEY WOULD TEAM UP TO INTERVENE IN THE F.X. MARKET TO SUPPORT THE YEN. HOW IS THAT SIGNIFICANT FROM WHERE YOU SIT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE OVERALL TRAJECTORY OF DOLLAR YEN AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT FLOWS IN CURRENCY MARKETS AFFECTING GLOBAL ECONOMIES? > > YEAH, THE REALITY HERE IS A FURTHER WEAKENING OF THE YEN FROM THE LEVELS WHERE WE WERE SEEING LAST WEEK, COMBINE WITH THAT FURTHER PRESSURE ON THE BACK END OF THE CURVE WOULD HAVE BEEN A THREAT TO JAPAN. BUT JAPAN IS A MAJOR FINANCIAL MARKET AND A MAJOR ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND THOSE PRESSURES IN JAPAN ALMOST INEVITABLY WOULD HAVE TRANSMITTED THEMSELVES INTO OTHER GLOBAL MARKETS. SO FROM A JAPANESE FINANCIAL STABILITY PERSPECTIVE, BUT FROM A GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY PERSPECTIVE, IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR THE U.S., JAPAN, POTENTIALLY OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE TENSIONS. AND CANDIDLY, I THINK IT’S ENCOURAGING TO SEE THE U.S. WORKING CLOSELY WITH SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL ALLIES. SCARLET: DOES THE U.S. WANT A WEAK DOLLAR OR NOT? I MEAN, OFFICIALLY IF YOU WERE TO ASK SCOTT BESSENT, THE TREASURY SECRETARY, HE SAID HE WOULD SAY THAT WE BELIEVE IN A STRONG DOLLAR, THAT IS OUR STANCE. AND THAT’S KIND OF BEEN CONSISTENT ACROSS ADMINISTRATIONS. YET WE KNOW THAT THIS PRESIDENT IS VERY FOCUSED ON MANUFACTURING, VERY FOCUSED ON EXPORTS, TRADE BALANCE, AND THAT WOULD ENTAIL A WEAKER CURRENCY. > > WELL, WHAT WE CAN SAY SAFELY IS WE’RE SEEING A VERY WEAK YEN. IT’S NOT QUITE AS WEAK AS IT WAS LAST WEEK, BUT THERE WERE FURTHER WEAKENING FROM THE 150’S INTO THE 160’S, THAT INSTABILITY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR U.S. MARKETS, WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR GLOBAL MARKETS, AND OVER AND ABOVE WHAT THAT IMPLIES ABOUT THE SPECIFIC LEVEL OF THE DOLLAR, IT WOULD BE WELCOME AND POTENTIALLY COULD SEE FURTHER VOLATILITY. BUT MAYBE MORE DIRECTLY ON YOUR QUESTION, I DON’T THINK SECRETARY BESSENT IS SHEDDING ANY TEARS TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF FURTHER DOLLAR DEPRECIATION FROM HERE. HE’S GOT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHEER IT ON TOO MUCH, BECAUSE IT CAN BECOME SELF-SUSTAINING, IT CAN BE A PROBLEM ON THE OTHER SIDE. BUT WHEN YOU VIEW THE DOLLAR FROM A LONGER TERM HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, IT IS STILL A REMARKABLY STRONG CURRENCY. HIGHWAY PATROL NATHAN -- SCARLET: NATHAN, I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE FOMC DECISION ON WEDNESDAY. WE KNOW THE FED IS UNLIKELY TO CUT INTEREST RATES, SO WHAT WILL BE IN FOCUS IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT JAY POWELL SAYS DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE. THERE’S NOT GOING TO BE A NEW UPDATE. WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANY KIND OF ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT ON HIS NEXT FED CHAIR PICK. SO THERE WILL BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS CERTAINLY AROUND FED INDEPENDENCE. WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO LEARN FROM JAY POWELL ON WEDNESDAY? > > I THINK THAT THIS IS PROBABLY AS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD A MEETING FOR THE FED AS WE’VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME, AS YOU HIGHLIGHT, VERY LITTLE PROBABILITY THAT THE FED IS GOING TO CUT. AND I THINK THE BIG QUESTION THAT WE IN THE MARKETS ARE FOCUSED ON IS JUST HOW MUCH JAY POWELL SIGNAL ABOUT THE MARCH MEETING. DOES HE HIGHLIGHT, IT COULD BE OPEN FOR FURTHER CUTS, VERSUS SPEAKING MORE SKEPTICALLY ABOUT CUTS? MY FEELING IS THAT JAY POWELL IS VERY PRAGMATIC, AND HE’S GOING TO WANT TO DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO PRESERVE HIS OPTIONALITY, AND HE’S GOING TO MAKE CLEAR WE’RE NOT CUTTING TODAY, BUT WE’LL SEE WHERE THE DATA LAND AND WE’RE PREPARED TO MOVE AS NECESSARY AT THE NEXT MEETING, WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER EASING OF POLICY. SCARLET: NATHAN, ALWAYS A PLEASURE SPEAK WITH YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. NATHAN SHEETS, GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITI RESEARCH. AND WHILE WE WERE JUST TALKING, THE PRESIDENT MAKING REMARKS AS WELL. HE SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ON KRISTI NOEM, A MEMBER OF HIS CABINET, WHO HEADS UP THE HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT. HE SAID SHE’S DOING A VERY GOOD JOB AND THAT HE HAS CONFIDENCE IN KRISTI NOEM, AND OF COURSE, THIS FOLLOWS THE EVENTS IN MINNESOTA AND HIS SENDING TOM OVER TO TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION IN MINNESOTA, TOM HOMAN, I SHOULD SAY, IN MINNESOTA, TO KIND OF OVERSEE THE EVENTS THERE. WE’LL KEEP YOU POSTED. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪ SCARLET: IT IS TIME FOR OUR STOCK OF THE HOUR. UNITED HEALTH IS TUMBLING AFTER THE HEALTHCARE GIANT GAVE A FULL-YEAR REVENUE FORECAST THAT DISAPPOINTED WALL STREET. FOR MORE DETAILS, LET’S BRING IN JOHN. IT’S NOT JUST UNITED HEALTH. ALL THE HEALTH THEY ARERS ARE DOWN, AND THIS IS MAINLY BECAUSE OF A PROPOSAL BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO NOT REDUCE SPENDING, BUT LIMIT THE INCREASES THAT IT PAYS ON MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS. WALK US THROUGH WHAT’S HAPPENING HERE. > > CORRECT, SO YESTERDAY AFTER THE CLOSE, THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED I SAID MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RATES FOR 2027, SO THE NEXT YEAR, AND THEY BASICALLY PROPOSED ZERO PERCENT INCREASE, THAT THEY WOULD HOLD RATES TO THESE COMPANIES FLAT. THAT WAS WELL BELOW WALL STREET’S EXPECTATIONS. PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR 5%, 6% INCREASE. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SAY IT’S NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH MEDICAL COSTS, WHICH WE KNOW HAVE BEEN RISING. SO THAT’S WHAT’S DRIVING THE MARKET SELLOFF TODAY. SCARLET: THAT’S WHAT’S DRIVING TODAY, BUT UNITED HEALTH IS ALSO A COMPANY THAT IS RAPIDLY SHRINKING. I CALLED IT A HEALTHCARE GIANT, BUT IT’S LESS OF A GIANT THAN IT WAS BEFORE. THE HEALTH INSURANCE UNIT IS SOMETHING THAT IT’S ALSO TRYING TO SLIM DOWN. > > YEAH, I THINK THEY’D PROBABLY CHARACTERIZE IT AS STREAMLINING. THIS IS THE LARGEST U.S. HEALTH INSURER THAT’S GROWN TREMENDOUSLY OVER THE PAST DECADE-PLUS, LOTS OF ACQUISITIONS. YOU KNOW, THEY HAD A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT LAST YEAR. THEY PULLED THEIR GUIDANCE, REPLACED THEIR C.E.O. THE NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM IS TRYING TO KIND OF TURN THINGS AROUND. AS PARTED OF THAT, THEY ARE EXITING SOME PLANS. THEY’RE REDUCING MEMBERSHIP IN SOME PLANS. THEY ARE DIVESTING SOME ASSETS, SHRINKING THEIR FOOTPRINT IN CARE DELIVERY DOMESTICALLY. SO YEAH, IT IS RETRENCHMENT FOR SURE FOR UNITED HEALTH. SCARLET: 2.8 MILLION FEWER MEMBERS THAN BEFORE. JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH, JOHN TOZZI COVERS THE HEALTHCARE COMPANIES FOR US AS A WHOLE. LET’S STAY WITH EARNINGS, BECAUSE WE’RE LOOKING AT SHARES OF GENERAL MOTORS TODAY. THE COMPANY HAS GREEN LIT $6 BILLION IN STOCK BUYBACKS AS IT EXPECTS A PROFIT JUMP THIS YEAR. THIS MORNING MATT MILLER FROM \"OPEN INTEREST\" SPOKE WITH G.M.’S C.E.O. ABOUT HOW THE COMPANY IS NAVIGATING A MARKET THAT IS SPLIT BETWEEN INTERNAL COMBINATION ENGINES AND E.V.’S. > > THE WHOLE INDUSTRY, WE WERE ON A PATH THAT WE WERE WORKING TO GET TO 40% TO 50% E.V.’S BY 2030. NOW THAT THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED AND THE CONSUMER INCENTIVES HAVE GONE, THERE IS GOING TO BE SLOWER E.D. ADAPTION. WE’RE STILL COMMITTED TO THEM. AND WE’VE GOT A GREAT PORTFOLIO. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT INTERNAL COMBINATION GENERAL PLAN, SO MORE AND MORE CHARGERS ARE AVAILABLE MUCH AS PEOPLE IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES SEE THAT THEY’VE GOT A ROBUST CHARGING NETWORK AND BELIEVE IF THEY HAVE TO GO ON A ROAD TRIP THERE’S THAT AS WELL, THEY’RE GOING TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. AND WHAT WE DO SEE IS ONCE SOMEONE BUYS A E.V., THEY SEE THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE, AND THEY STICK WITH THEM. I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN OVER TIME, AND THAT’S WHY DURING THIS PERIOD WE’VE ALREADY GOT A GREAT PORTFOLIO OF E.V.’S. WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TAKE COSTS OUT TO GET OUR E.V. PORTFOLIO PROBABLY, AND WE’RE GOING TO BE WELL POSITIONED AS E.V. DEMAND GROWS OVER THE NEXT HANDFUL OF YEARS. MATT: G.M. WAS A LEADER IN HYBRID TECHNOLOGY. I REMEMBER WHEN THE TAHOE CAME OUT WITH A SIX-LEADER GAS ENGINE AND ELECTRIC BATTERY POWER. WILL YOU START TO SELL MORE OF THE HYBRID VEHICLES? > > WELL, WE HAVE ALWAYS FOCUSED, AS YOU SAID, WE HAVE GREAT HYBRID TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE GREAT E.V. TECHNOLOGY. WE’RE ONE OF THE FEW O.E.M.’S THAT INVESTED IN A DEDICATED E.V. PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE PORTFOLIO WE HAVE. WE’RE FOCUSED ON THE END GAME, AND WE HAVE AFFORDABLE E.V.’S. SO I THINK THAT’S WHERE OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS. WE UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE IT IN OTHER REGIONS. YOU’LL SEE US WITH A HANDFUL OF HYBRIDS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS IS REALLY ON HAVING THE RIGHT INTERNAL COMBINATION ENGINE PORTFOLIO AND THE RIGHT E.V. PORTFOLIO MOVING FORWARD. SCARLET: THAT WAS THE CHAIR AND C.E.O. OF GENERAL METS. MATT MILLER JOINED US RIGHT NOW. SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY WERE LOOKING TO GET TO 40% TO 50% E.V.’S, BUT IT FEELS LIKE THEY’RE NOT AS FOCUSED ON THAT. WHAT DOES THE E.V. SIDE OF THE PORTFOLIO LOOK LIKE? IS IT LIKE AN 80-20 SPLIT? MATT: WELL, THEY DON’T SELL NEARLY THAT MANY E.V.’S, AND THEY LOSE MONEY ON EVERY ONE THEY SELL. IF THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SELL MORE OF THESE HIGH-MARGIN S.U.V.’S AND TRUCKS, LIKE THE ESCALADE AND SIERRA -- SCARLET: THE GAS GUZZLERS. MANUS: YOU CAN CALL THEM THAT, YES, THEN THEY’LL MAKE MORE MONEY AS A COMPANY. IN FACT, IF THEY SOLD MORE E.V.’S, THEY WOULD MAKE BIGGER LOSSES AS IT STANDS NOW. BUT WHAT MARY HAS BEEN SAYING IS THAT SHE’S REALLY TRYING TO GET THE COST DOWN ON THE E.V. SIDE. THE INTERESTING THING IS IS THEY HAVE SUCH A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF E.V.’S. I MEAN, THEY HAVE THE EQUINOX. THEY HAVE THE BLAZER. THEY HAVE THE SIERRA. THEY HAVE THE HUMMER. WE HAVE THE ESCALADE AND ON AND ON AND ON I COULD GO. WHEREAS FORD, THEIR CROSS TOWN RIVAL ONLY HAD THE F150 LIGHTNING AND THE MUSTANG MACH-E. FORD HAS TAKEN A WRITEDOWN TO TURN THEIR E.V. BUSINESS AROUND, AND G.M. HAS ONLY TAKEN A $7.6 BILLION WRITEDOWN. I THINK IT’S INTERESTING TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE TWO. BUT NEITHER ONE MAKES UP THE BULK OF REVENUES FOR EITHER COMPANY. SCARLET: G.M. EXPECTS MORE WRITEDOWNS TIED TO ITS E.V. BUSINESS THIS YEAR, EVEN AS IT RELAUNCHES THE CHEVY VOLT ONCE AGAIN. MATT: THE VOLT NOW. THE BOLT WAS THE ORIGINAL HYBRID THAT THEY HAD. I WANT TO SAY NOW 15, MAYBE EVEN 20 YEARS AGO. THE VOLT IS ONE THAT THEE HAD A FEW DIFFERENT ITERATIONS OF, AND IT’S VERY POPULAR WITH CONSUMERS BECAUSE IT’S A MUCH LOWER COST CAR. YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT A $30,000 PRICE TAG. SCARLET: IMAGINE THAT. MANUS: AS OPPOSED TO THE AVERAGE NEW CAR COSTS WELL OVER $50,000, AND YOU HAVE TO FACTOR IN ALSO THE COST OF FINANCING IT, WHICH, YOU KNOW, MOST EVERYONE HAS TO DO AT A 8%, EVEN 10% LEVEL. AND THE COST OF INSURANCE. A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN’T THINKING ABOUT THE COST OF NEW CARS, DON’T PUT A GOOD ENOUGH ESTIMATE IN FOR INSURANCE, BECAUSE THOSE COSTS HAVE CLIMBED BY SO MUCH THAT CAR OWNERSHIP BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT. SCARLET: AND IT’S BECOME A MOVING TARGET AS WELL, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH INSURANCE RATE STATES, LIKE NEW YORK. MATT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT CAR DO YOU DRIVE? MA.MATT: TODAY I’M DRIVING THE ASTON MARTIN,. SCARLET: LOVE THIS. MATT MILLER, \"OPEN INTEREST\" CO-HOST AND, OF COURSE, HE ALSO HOSTS A PODCAST CALLED. MANUS: HOT PURSUIT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHECKING IT OUT. SCARLET: COMING UP, A TOUGH MOMENT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. WE’LL TELL YOU HOW VEHICLES HAVE BROKEN DOWN, LEAVING COLLEGES VULNERABLE AT A TIME THEY REALLY CAN’T AFFORD TO BE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪ SCARLET: THE YALE ENDOWMENT MODEL SET THE STANDARD FOR ELITE UNIVERSITIES. YALE POURED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER AS SETS, GENERATING BIG OWNERS OVER DECADES. IT’S NO LONGER WORKING AS WELL. JUST LOOK AT HOW YALE’S ENDOWMENT HAS UNDERPERFORMED RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. THIS IS THE TOPIC OF BLOOMBERG’S LATEST BIG TAKE. THE AUTHOR OF IT IS OUR HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCE REPORTER AND JOINS US NOW. I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING IS, IS THE YALE ENDOWMENT MODEL DEAD? > > WELL, IT’S NOT ENTIRELY DEAD, AS WE HAD A COMMENT FROM A PENSION FUND MANAGER WHO OVERSEES ABOUT $25 BILLION, IT MIGHT BE ON LIFE SUPPORT. BUT GIN WHAT’S HAPPENING WITH PRIVATE EQUITY RETURNS, AND THERE AREN’T AS MANY I.P.O.’S WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES, AND SCHOOLS HAD LOTS OF PRIVATE EQUITY, PERFORMED REALLY WELL, AND NOW IT’S UPWARDS OF 40% IN SOME PORTFOLIOS. SO THEY NEED SOME LIQUIDITY, MAYBE TO REFRESH THEIR MANAGERS AND GET SOME MONEY OUT. SCARLET: RIGHT, AND THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO, AS YOU POINT OUT IN YOUR STORY, U.C.’S ENDOWMENT, WHICH IS TRACKING STOCKS AND BONDS, WHICH HAS DONE INCREDIBLY WELL. > > YES, THEY CREATED A SEPARATE FUND ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO, AND IN AN 80-20 INDEX FUND, AND IT’S DONE AMAZINGLY WELL. AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED DURING COVID WHEN THEY WANTED SOME LIQUIDITY. THEY RETURNED ALMOST $2 BILLION TO THE SCHOOLS. CONTRAST THAT TO 2008 WHEN SCHOOLS NEEDED LIQUIDITY DURING THE RECESSION, AND WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO? THEY HAD TO SELL SECONDARY. THEY HAD TO ISSUE DEBT. VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SCARLET: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THEY HAD TO SELL SECONDARY AT A DEEP DISCOUNT AS WELL. A LOT HAS TO DO WITH THE TIMES, RIGHT? HIGHER EDUCATION IS UNDER ATTACK FROM THE PRESIDENT, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY HAVE TO PAY ENDOWMENT TAXES. AND THERE’S HUGE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS. AND THAT BRINGS US TO ANOTHER STORY THAT YOU WROTE ABOUT, WHICH IS YALE GOING TUITION-FREE, AND WHAT I THINK WILL SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE, THIS IS FOR FAMILIES MAKING BELOW $200,000. > > YES, TUITION-FREE, THAT DOESN’T INCLUDE EVERYTHING ELSE, SUCH AS ROOM AND BOARD AND TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER THINGS. BUT OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE. HARVARD DID THIS ABOUT A YEAR AGO. PRINCETON AND M.I.T. AND OTHER PEERS, IN ORDER TO SAY WE CAN BE SOMEWHAT AFFORDABLE TO FAMILIES, YOU KNOW, THIS FOLLOWS WHAT SCHOOLS DID RIGHT BEFORE THE RECESSION, WHEN THEY HAD ADOPTED POLICIES OF NOT HAVING LOANS IN FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES. NOW, KEEP IN MIND, NOT ALL THE ELITE UNIVERSITIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS. IT’S ALSO QUITE A LOT OF MONEY -- SCARLET: AND THIS SAYS NOT EVEN TIED TO THE ENDOW THE, THE FINANCIAL AID, OR IT IS? > > THE ENDOWMENT IS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO YALE’S BUDGET. KEEP THAT IN MIND. YOU MENTIONED THE ENDOWMENT TAX. HARVARD WAS ALSO PROJECTED TO COST ABOUT $300 MILLION EACH YEAR. SCARLET: YEAH, THAT’S DEFINITELY A NEW CHART THAT THEY DIDN’T HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A DECADE AGO.
