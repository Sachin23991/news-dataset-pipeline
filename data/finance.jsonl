Ned Lamont (D) told Balance of Power wind power is essential to bringing down energy costs in New England. \n\nThe US is suspending leases for all five wind farms under construction off the East Coast, the latest blow to an industry that’s been targeted repeatedly by the Trump administration as part of its attack on clean energy.\nThe US Interior Department announced the move Monday, citing national security concerns as the massive turbines may interfere with radar systems. The suspension will let the administration work with developers and states to mitigate any security risks, the department said in a statement.\nThe projects impacted are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Coastal Virginia, which lies off the coast of its titular state; Revolution Wind, near Rhode Island; and Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise Wind, both off the coast of New York. The five projects represent about $28b in total committed capital, according to BloombergNEF. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nIf, in fact, this is halted here. The mayor of New London, Michael Bizzaro, says the Grinch has just stolen Christmas. Is he right? Not a heck of a Christmas present, was it? What you just heard the president say. It does high wind power, but he's not the leader of things that were committed a long time ago. Are we in revolution when was actually permitted under from one back in 2000, 1890. So a long time ago. So this was a real shock to our system. They did it to us over Labor Day as well. Remember, they had a stop work order, no warning at all this time. They've pulled the permits and we've got to fight like hell to come back because they're never going to bring down the price of electricity in New England unless we get more generation. And that's what wind power does. Governor, in September, your state successfully won its bid in courts to lift the moratorium that the Trump administration put in when it first took office on wind power. Now, the administration is going at it again and raising national security concerns. Some analysts are looking at that and saying this could be a more durable way to essentially do the same thing. What's your take? And do you think those national security concerns are legitimate? No, I think the president said I don't like wind power. Come up with another way that I think you can shut it down. And it was only very recently they came up with these are national security concerns. I talked to the secretary of interior, Doug Burgum. I known for many years. I said, I'm not sure this is real, but if you want to, we'll come down, we'll talk to you about it. We'll bring down the folks building the wind power, the engineers. But don't stop us in maybe construction for the second time in three months. You're just blowing a hole in our efforts to bring down the price of electricity in New England. You know, we understand that this project is about 85% complete. It would power some 350,000 homes across Connecticut and Rhode Island. What will happen to electricity bills without the wind farm more likely to spike if we can't get pipes in the ground and get natural gas and oil? We're just not that type of the state. We don't have the capacity is very rare that we can create our own generation. Offshore wind is one way we can do that. And the more generation we have, the less spiking energy during very cold periods. And that means we can save money for electric ratepayers. We want to welcome our viewers joining us from the TV side, Bloomberg TV colleagues. And we are here with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, talking, of course, about this new announcement out of the Department of Energy today, putting a halt on those five major wind farm projects, including the one that's being assembled in your state. Governor, I'm curious how this is going to play with constituents, not only in your state but across the country as energy prices are expensive, it's cold and they're looking to spike. You know, the energy crisis is something that's constantly talked about. This is also an administration that is trying to remove barriers to other forms of energy, including nuclear. The president has said he wants to restart coal. So why not add wind energy to that? Why is this specific mechanism of generating power in his crosshairs? It is contradictory. I've talked to the president about this. He cares very strongly about bringing down the price of electricity, especially in New England, where we don't have a lot of our own generation and gets expensive. I said, We'll work with you on a nuclear power to work with you on natural gas and other sources. But don't pull the plug on a plant that's already 85% complete, ready to turn on in just a few months. That makes no sense at all. I thought we had an agreement. They weren't going to do that. Then we were shocked. All right. Well, I want to get back to the justification from the administration here, Governor, and I know you commented on this briefly, but I'd like to hear more about the national security concerns or lack there of knowing that the Interior Department says these turbines may interfere with radar systems. We understand, however, according to the attorney general, William Tong, the project's already gone through a federal review. He says fully vetted, permitted state, federal, up and down, inside out every which way you can. Is that correct? WILLIAMS Absolutely correct. And actually, it went through a very strong national security review over the last few years, voted on on a bipartisan basis in Congress just a year and a half ago. What they said with the administration just making this already, it is the administration just making this up then. I think so. But look, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Get us down there. Will bring the very best engineers from worst. Ed, who's a developer, will talk it through. But there's no excuse for shutting this down in mid-stride. Not in the ninth inning of the ballgame. Look, they're saying drones has changed the world dramatically. They want to take a second look and, you know, on shore radar and then change the world in the last 12 months. Also, this is not the point you made earlier. This is not a new technology. These wind turbines have existed in Europe, much to the president's chagrin, for quite a few years now. We haven't previously heard of it having big impacts on NAITO or Europe's military readiness in offshore areas there. We've also got some reporting from Bloomberg and analysts at Raymond James saying I'm skeptical that there's any new information about the military concerns all of a sudden that singlehandedly warrants these projects being halted. So do you think this is an aesthetic, not necessarily an economic or national security decision? You know, I mean, last time around it was birds and whales. This time around, it's radar. I don't know what it's going to be next time. I got to tell you, I come out of the business world. I thought the Trump administration had a lot of business folks and it was going to be a pro-business administration. But this herky jerky on again, off again. First, they didn't snap. Now they're doing wind power. Makes it very difficult to do business with this administration. Very difficult. Well, I'd like to hear more about that just from your view. In Connecticut, you mentioned SNAP. We can add Obamacare subsidies that are about to expire, sending people's bills higher. How much are you and other governors working to fill affordability gaps that are being created by the administration? I can tell you here in Connecticut, we've set aside, you know, $500 million just to lease protect the most vulnerable. But the idea that you're going to yank food support from working families when food prices have almost doubled in the last five years made no sense. And it's pointed out when it comes to the health care subsidies on the exchange, people are going to see their bills go up one or $2,000. That's a heck of a Christmas present. And that's a real shock to the system. So we made sure that we protected all of our families up to about 128,000. Then we soften the blow for everybody else. Governor, you said you've been talking to the Trump administration throughout this process and about this decision, how they're treating it previously. I'm wondering, did you get any kind of a heads up? Have you spoken to the president since this decision came down? And if not, what do you want to tell him? No, This really came out of left field at the very last moment. We had had a conference call, all the governors with secretaries. And right just a couple of weeks ago talking about pipelines and natural gas just did not come up at all. Like I said, I think this is a problem, a solution, looking for a problem and it's the wrong solution. Just lastly, then, Governor, what would you tell people driving to work today in Putnam, Connecticut, who are already looking at expensive electric bills? They're worried about the data center that might be coming in next door. Do they need to brace for higher prices? And what will they look like in 2026? Well, we're seeing a pause on data centers just because they suck so much electricity and drive up costs. But one of the things we need is more generation. I think those rate payers in Putnam know all too well. We're doing everything we can to add more electricity generation, bring down costs for you and your family and call the Cleveland revolution. Win in the ninth inning. Makes no sense at all. Well, this is something that we're going to keep talking about here. It sounds like you might not have a sense or be able to quantify how much those bills are going to rise. Governor, is that fair to say? I can tell you that it's going to go up and it could go up dramatically during very cold times when wind power is generating the most and we're going to have a spike in energy demand. That's what I'm trying to protect you from.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:34:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:32.832007"}

(Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nCan. Logan, great to have both of you here in studio. Of course, the kickoff to season three of the Golden Touch and talk a little bit about just the process of filming this series for Netflix, of course, alongside Logan Paul, who appears in at least two or three of those episodes here. Oh, look, I love the show, You know, King of Collectibles, The Golden Touch. This is our third season launch today. It's, you know, takes you into the incredible world of collectibles. The value of the items, the history behind it, the story of the chase, the excitement, and also the personalities that collect the items that buy the items. And you know why the collectibles are so incredibly important. It's a fast paced show, and I love doing it. I'm I hope I'm doing it ten years from now. When you talk about personalities, no one's a bigger personality than Logan. Paul, you seem to be clutching your chest right now. Is that because you're wearing a very expensive jacket? Yeah. Well, yeah, the jacket is expensive, but that's neither here nor there. No, it's because I have the most expensive Pokemon card around my neck, and I. Yeah, Look, Super Bowl might be one of one PSA ten Pikachu Illustrator that is on season three of show, the most coveted card in the world. Absolutely. So those folks who aren't Pokémon experts, I mean, you famously bought this card back in 2021, the most expensive one ever. And this is a rarity. I mean, these cards weren't really sold. They were just kind of given out. Right. And at some point, you managed to get a hold of one of the few, not only just intact ones, but I'm pretty sure this is the highest rated one out there. Yeah, it's the only one in the world that's a PSA ten. Meaning it's perfect. Yeah. And like I said, it's one of one. Like you said, it was one of 39 copies handed out in 1998 for a Pokemon illustration contest. So this card couldn't be bought. It was earned, which is part of the reason why the lore contributes to such a high value for the card. When you pay what by most reports is upwards of $5 million. For this, there are a lot of people. They said you are an idiot. Yeah. Like, what is he doing? Who would pay that much for a card? Now I'm told that you're actually willing to put this back onto the market. You think you're going to get more than the five $5.3 million that you paid for it? Look, that's honestly always the goal, right? But I actually say willing is a great word. I had to be convinced to put this card at auction. Ken has chased me for years trying to convince you to sell the card. And let's be honest, the Pokemon market is as hot as it's ever been right now. And those people who thought I was an idiot, I think I'm the one laughing in the face now because Pokemon has delivered higher returns than the stock market in the past 20 years. Buy it by upwards of 3,000%. And so while I think this will probably go for more than I bought it for, it's an auction, but it is the best card in the world. There's nothing like it and it's a piece of history now. I wore it out to my WrestleMania debut. It's on Ken's Netflix show, and I think we're excited to see what he can go for. And it's funny you bring it up and we talk about this idea of collecting or just let's start with art, right? That was what if you had a lot of money, you bought your your Monets or Jackson Pollock, things like that. There was sort of this wave a few years ago with this younger generation coming in, Ken, as you know, that were much more interested in things like Pokemon cards, Magic, the gathering cards, sports memorabilia, and a lot of people kind of scratch their heads. What's that really worth? Comic books, you know, hip hop memorabilia. It's really expanded. Talk about how that's expanded your business away from the more traditional collectibles that we think about here. What you have to realize is that collectibles as a category right now is an asset class. It is an alternative asset class. And while maybe in, you know, in 100 years ago and also in the 1930, 40 or 5060s, you know, collecting art, whether it was Picasso, whether it was Renoir, whether it was Monet, Warhol to go more recent, you know, was what the, quote, super Rich did. And that was the traditional collectibles. You know, people who, you know, grew up worshipping athletes and people you know of, you know, a little younger than me who grew up on Pokemon, which has its 30th anniversary in February this year. You know, they did not grow up dreaming about owning a big art collection. And as they get into their thirties and forties and fifties and late twenties, they have a lot of money. So to them, owning the best of the best, whether it's a Pokemon card, whether it's a game used jersey, whether it's a sports card, that is what they aspire to be, and that is how we can see something like a basketball card with pictures of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant sell for 12 and a half million dollars. Yeah, that's how we can see a jersey worn by Babe Ruth sell for 24 million. That's how I can sell a baseball that was hit by Shohei Ohtani for 4.4 million. And that's how we can see, you know, the Pokemon illustrator. This single best card. Yeah, I did the entire poker. My genre, which is the world's biggest franchise, sell for eight figures. But there's also added value to it as well. Obviously the card in and of itself has value, but the fact that it's associated with someone like Logan Paul or you have a celebrity, I mean, there's a rarity, as you know, in the collectibles market that drives price. And you talk about you wearing it in your WWE debut and the other facts. I mean, that has to add to the value, right? Not only that, am I going to get this illustrator card, but I'm taking the illustrator card that was once owned by Logan Paul We will see. I would I would certainly think. Right. But the card's only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Like Ken said, Pokemon is the highest grossing, most popular franchise in the world. It's a Guinness World Record setting card as well at this point. So yeah, it has the lore, it has the story, It does have all of the ingredients include the actual substances substance of the card itself. Yeah. To potentially sell for eight figures like Ken said. But you know, well we'll see what people are willing to pay for it. I would also like to point out most people don't wear eight figures around their neck. Is now is the is the change is the framing and the changes that come with it. It just doesn't. Yeah. And I asked if I could do it. I want to hand-deliver it to the buyer because when I bought this card from the guy who I chased it down for from four years, he was in Dubai and he made it an experience for me and it contributed to how I felt about the card. And so who for whoever buys it, I would like to reciprocate that and make it an experience for them as well by delivering it myself. Logan Talk about some of the other things that you've bought, collectibles that you've bought, and I am curious also, how do you make sure that what you're getting is authentic, that you don't sort of get taken by somebody trying to find something off? Well, actually, I've bought a decent art from Golden Auctions, and the goal there is that auction houses have a reputation, and that reputation hopefully means that the items you're buying from them is authentic. So the authenticity is kind of like a check when I buy most of these items. But man, I'm a I'm a collector of all sorts of things. I have Michael Jordan Fleer rookie and PSA ten. I have Erling Haaland's, one of one super factor. I got Wayne Gretzky's last championship game hockey stick for $336,000. I bought a meteorite older than the Earth, 4.5 billion years old for like $80,000. KS bears the dinosaur skull. A triceratops skull in my living room. Yeah. Painting a Bob Ross, Right? Dude, I love collectibles. Yeah, because they mean something to me. They're an art piece, and hopefully they appreciate in value because it's part of this strategic asset class that I think people are now finally becoming aware of and so can talk about that asset class. I mean, we're talking about a market now, the collectibles market. If you just take traditional art out of it, you're talking about a few hundred dollars Billion now and it gets you this idea of what comes next. I mean, what do you think that next generation are going to be chasing after? Because I assume it's going to be something maybe a little bit different. Sure. I mean, look, I think as far as sports cards, what I tell people is, you know, professional baseball has been around since the 1860s and baseball cards have been around since the 1860s. So I think the traditional stuff, like trading cards of all genres, you know, is certainly going to continue to only rise in popularity, especially when you have some of the larger companies like PSA and fanatics with, you know, billions of dollars invested in the industry and athletes getting into it. You know, anything can really become a collectible. And to me, you know, just because I don't collect what somebody else collects doesn't mean it's not a collectible. For example, we had our first ever rock and roll and hip hop auction. We set records. I mean, whether it was Tupac, whether it was Nirvana, whether it was Guns and Roses, this stuff was going for Absolutely. Eminem. I mean, crazy prices for four albums and four greatest albums. And what really made the trading card market take off? Yeah, is when the great grading companies came in. And now there are companies that grade, you know, cassettes and albums and CDs and the market's taking off. And it's funny to mention, I mean, the hip hop auction was big. You know, somebody who collects a lot of stuff from hip hop, a lot of the stuff was seen as worthless just a few years ago. And now you have, I think with Christie's or Sotheby's doing their own sort of hip hop auctions. But it gets to this idea and I want to get to this idea with you, Logan, the idea of kind of being an outsider, I mean, your fame and your celebrity did not go through the traditional path, obviously, with Vine and YouTube and eventually with wrestling and all the other ventures that you have here. And I do wonder if that parallels kind of what we're seeing also in collectibles, where you have people just saying, no, we don't need to do it the old fashioned way in terms of, you know, what we collect and how it's true. I mean, yeah, collecting is nice because if you're passionate about something or even just care a little bit, you can make a foray into the hobby. Like, Dude, I started collecting rocks when I was a kid and then it moved to coins and then it graduated to footballs. And my interests have changed and I made a lot of money and I spend it on cardboard and, you know, like you said. Some people laughed at me at the time. But collecting is nice because like, you don't need a credential to start. You can just buy things that interest you. And you know, like I said, the goal is always that they appreciate in value. All right. Season three is out now or coming out now. What else is next for you and you and Logan? Well, we we have a as people will find out by watching the show. We have planned together what we believe will be the biggest TCG trading card game auction in history. The illustrator is going to be the anchor and there is going to be millions and millions and millions of other dollars of other items. You know, Pokémon Magic, The Gathering, and similar items. And we're going to have the auction is going to launch in January. It's going to close February 15th and timing it for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon. And that's something that, you know, we're looking you know, my worst case scenario on that is 15 million. I'd love to do a 25 or $30 million auction with that. And that's that's really, to me, a big event for the industry. I can tell you what's happening for the industry right now. Over the past six weeks, I've been contacted by multiple firms that are either in existence or just starting up or want to start up to have, you know, basically funds dedicated to collectibles. When you say funds like coins, like like, like, like, like, like a gold fund or a crypto fund, but a collectible fund and, you know, whether it's $50 million or 250 million, we seen that, I mean, or something like an even an ETF or something. That's exactly what people are looking to do for now. There is there is one company out there that is doing it. They're doing it solely with basketball cards. These these people want to do a more broader basket. And, you know, as as probably hobby wise, the most well-known guy, they're coming to me and asking for advice. But I, I think that that is really going to take the market to the next level. And you think that's possible? I mean, what are the regulations? You think there is a successful fund? Yes, that's operating right now. Yeah. And but it's very private, very closely held. Sure. But I do think that, you know, there's so much opportunity, I expect that to happen.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:31:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:42:12.375284"}

{"title": "Baby Bonds vs. Trump Accounts", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-12-24/baby-bonds-vs-trump-accounts-video", "summary": "A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. Darrick Hamilton, Henry Cohen Professor of Economics and Urban Policy at the New School, is behind a comparable concept known as \"baby bonds,\" which he sees as a means to granting more social mobility and agency to young people regardless of family income levels. Professor Hamilton compares and contrasts his idea with the Trump administration's mechanism with Alexis Christoforous and Isabelle Lee on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWhat is, I guess, the main difference between baby bonds and the Trump accounts? Because on their face, there seem to be a lot of similarities. Well, conceptually, the goal is to provide access to asset building by way of having some financial capital so that you can get into that building. The problem with the Trump accounts versus baby bonds is baby bonds focus on what actually is the problem. It's one of endowment, essentially the way wealth is created, as wealth begets more wealth. It's having a large enough nest egg so that you can get into a home or get into an education without debt, or to be able to have some capital to start a business. The Trump accounts essentially emphasize savings by way of the tax code. So in an ironic way, it's structured in a way that's potentially going to subsidize those that have the wherewithal to raise capital in the first place. What does it signal to you when billionaires step in to fund used wealth building programs? Are we seeing it as innovation that government couldn't achieve on its own, or is it just a quiet shift away from maybe public responsibility? I mean, I applaud philanthropy that desires to be vanguards and trying to create pathways to democratize wealth. However, however, the mechanism in this case is only feeding into a bad system. The federal government should not be ultimately subsidized for their duty. We shouldn't be reliant on the charitable contributions of a billionaire for our salvation. But what a billionaire can do is provide demonstration, be a catalyst, seed some some momentum so that we ultimately can have them invest. And, you know, I'll make one other quick point, which is when you think about the $6.4 billion, which is a huge number, it requires context. So two context points. One is it's contextual to that $4 trillion big, beautiful bill that was referenced at the beginning of the segment. So if we're thinking about the ways in which the federal government is spending wealth towards advancing access to asset building for the population, that 6.4 billion deserves context to that $4 trillion, which is from our public regress. And then the other context, about 80% of children between the ages of zero and ten will have some access to this donation, this regress. But if you were to disaggregate that, that amounts to about $250 per child. Right. So essentially, that's not going to be the catalyst. So it's distracting a little bit. You know, some countries have done this pretty successfully, right? I know. I believe Germany is among them. They'll give an allowance, a monthly allowance to parents for for kids of a certain age. Some countries use it as an incentive to get people to have more children. It's now these baby bonds have been implemented in, let's say, Connecticut since 2023. I believe they were the first state. How are things going? Oh, it's still the infancy there, but how are things going? I mean, Connecticut is a really great model and it's a state, so it doesn't have the capacities of the federal government. But here you have a scenario with every Medicaid birth will receive 30 $200 automatically at birth. And the Treasurer is managing that money in a collective fund in an astute way with responsible investing, where the projections are that the children, you know, low income children born as part of a medicaid birth from rural to urban areas throughout the state will have about 12 to 18000 as some seed capital to begin wealth building. Any you know, other examples would be the U.K. did it. They didn't fund it to the extent that we would call for in the U.S. And then here's perhaps even the best counterfactual. The United States has done similar programs with the GI Bill. That's about right. We have a history of doing this. Do you think that programs like these have an influence to affect economic policy long term, or do you think to create risking a system that just really hinges on, to your point, philanthropy of maybe rich individuals or big corporations? And that's exactly why it should be a government responsibility. And here's the point. This is not charity. This is an investment. So if you believe in the market, if you don't believe in the market regardless, again, it's pretty simple. The way wealth is created, it is that down payment to put you in an asset that passively appreciates over your life. So if you are authentically somebody who believes in transaction in the market, then you should support people having some seed capital to get into that asset. So again, it's a question of endowment, not savings behavior. Is there anything about the Trump accounts that you actually like? I mean, we have to I think we can agree that, you know, the concept I mean, the heart's in the right place. You Well, I mean that to sit at the attention of. On trying to make sure that we democratize access to wealth. That's a good thing. But to structure the 529 structure, we have lessons from that where, you know, 529 saving tax provision savings so that we can provide access to college for our children. The bottom half percent of earners essentially don't participate. Only about 2.5% of Americans participate. So there are really good ways we can do it. My fear is that we co-opt a good idea. It's a really good idea. We have pathways to really facilitate a good value for our American economy, which is inclusion. We just got to work on the delivery. To Alexis point, there's the idea of corp match welfare embedded here. Are there any upsides to that? What should policymakers be cautious about? I apologize for laughing, but the phrasing of of of corporate welfare again, I it I take the Dell's is being not disingenuous but really trying to be supportive. I think there's better ways there's more catalytic ways they could spend that $6.4 billion. But at the end of the day, the American people don't want to be at the whim of billionaires. And then there are other aspects as well that we should be leery about, which is state private partnerships for which we have to be concerned about the potential for grift when we're relying on billionaires to provide economic security for the American people. So if if we're thinking, you know, look, a lot of folks are not going to take advantage of a 529 plan, is that because they don't have the money to do it? Is that because they don't know they exist? Is that because a lot of Americans cannot be left to their own devices to save for themselves? I mean, think about how, you know, some of our our programs like Social Security came to be. It's because it was supposed to be some sort of a safety net. So. So is it a good idea for the government to put aside some money for folks who might not otherwise do it? I mean, that actually is a great idea. But just how in the mechanisms by which we do it, that's the problem. So it is the case that clearly we have an affordability crisis in this country so people don't have the wherewithal to save en masse. And that's a big reason why people don't participate in a 529 counts, not as if they don't love and adore their children and desire for them to have savings. It's wherewithal. And then the other big point is for those that have amassed wealth in America, it's not active saving lives, driving debt. And by active savings income that we actively save, it's passive savings. It's that down payment. It is critical for young adults to really have some capital so that they can get into that automatic vehicle to save.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:54:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T06:44:04.353345"}

From politics and policy to tech and trends, David Ingles and Annabelle Droulers give global investors unique insight, delivering in-depth discussions with the newsmakers who matter. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nGood morning. It's 9 a.m. here in Hong Kong, in Shanghai and in Shenzhen. You're watching the China tour, our final full broadcast of the year coming out to the open markets in Greater China. Let's get to top stories today. Stocks across the region up after tech gains pushing Wall Street to yet another record. Ethics markets in focus with the yuan at its strongest level in over 14 months. Seven is very much in focus. And also in South Korea, warning against excessive weakness in their currency. Gold soaring above 40 $500 an ounce for the very first time. And escalating tensions in Venezuela and lots of bets on more Fed rate cuts in 2026. Also ahead, Washington holding off on new tariffs on Chinese chips even after accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices. Plus, we take a closer look at the challenges facing Chinese battery maker Seattle as the company seeks new markets overseas. Welcome to the program. Hope you're all well. Lots to get through over the next 2 hours or so. Let's get started with what's really been a fairly consistent story almost all year round, with the exception of a few wobbles, as we can see the rally across risk assets. Right. Asia Pacific 2 to 7 right now in the benchmark 3/10 of 1%. As you can see, the tech, the tech sub gauge is leading that one. COSBY There's a separate conversation. We'll get to that in a moment. As far as the currency goes, some strong language coming through out of authorities there, leading to some strength coming through in their currency. Taiwan is coming in line within that market. It's not just tech. We're looking at insurers to given this rule change and effects. More on that as well later on. We talked about the one winning today, dollar one down. As you can see, we're up 1%, stronger than 1% on the Korean currency, 1.4, rather, 156 now on dollar yen. The markets there warning of strong determination as it pertains to maybe these moves in the market might have reached maybe a tad or to a level a notch or two beyond what is comfortable. Question mark. Right. The big story as well in markets is when you have copper at 12,000, we took that out yesterday, 4500 and gold, also a nice round number on platinum. We're up about 3% there in silver, of course, 150% year to date. We took out 70 yesterday. It looks like 72 is a very, very close, if not already on time contracts very quickly the approach of the Chinese market open. So we talked about copper coming up on your screens as well and to see you in China is 7017. And the reason that's important, if that puts us about 0.2 6%, 0.27%, just doing some rough math in my head, which roughly translates to about that's about a one standard deviation move historical that's a daily if we get that which is rare of course, statistically that would take us below seven. Suffice to say it's possible, but unlikely. And we are looking at weakness going into the open today. And of course it's a public service reminder that several markets in the region are operating on truncated sessions today Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and also in New Zealand. Okay, let's have a look at the agenda today. And oh, okay. This is the agenda today. Well, it's partly it. So the next rally we had the Fix. It's an early close in Hong Kong, but yeah, okay, we'll talk about this later. Okay. Let's talk about the chip curbs. Right. The US is holding off when new chip Chinese chip towers until MIT. We'll fix that for you is what I'm trying to say. That's despite accusing Beijing of engaging in unfair trade practices in the chip sector. Let's bring in Min Miller, China correspondent here with us on set to tell us more about this investigation. It's it's something that didn't happen overnight was months long. What did the findings and what what it might mean for her policy. Yeah. So it's nearly a year in the making. It was launched in the final few weeks of the former US President Joe Biden's administration, and it was expected that President Trump would resolve this by the findings from the U.S. Trade Representative offices that China has used aggressively and sweeping to use non-market policies to create foreign dependence on its products in a way that was not advantages for U.S. commerce. So the decision is not to impose any tariffs in the next six months, but starting from June 2027, they will impose tariffs, but rates are only going to be announced at least a month before. So this is a clear signal that President Trump is in some ways trying to stabilize ties here and keep to that tweet truce that he agreed with President Xi when they met in South Korea. But at the same time also creating that opening right to revisit this one and a half years later and potentially a bargaining chip when China and U.S. has to renegotiate the extension of the trade truce. Already, we're not even at 2026. You're taking us into mid 2027 amendment. What was China's response to this? So the US, the Chinese embassy in the US has responded and obviously hit back at this, saying that, you know, they're opposed to this and also saying that they will take whatever necessary measures to protect their legitimate rights and interests. And you can see here the statement they said to instrumentalize and weaponize trade and take issues and destabilise global industrial supply chains will benefit no one and will eventually backfire. Now, this comes as China also hit back against the new US rules to ban foreign drones and drone pods, and also saying that that the US is bullying Chinese companies, saying that China reserves the right to protect or safeguard Chinese interests and also calling on the US to withdraw those rules. Right. Thank you so much, Laura, China correspondent there. Our other top story, all the data that came through overnight in the US, obviously the headline was GDP. Within that you had several things like so the two year yield, for example, spiking a little bit. Not a lot of material pricing changes around the Fed. You have consumer confidence numbers separately also showing. Maybe the opposite, but maybe the same. Right. It's a it's a multi multifaceted coin. Consumption and exports driving us growth. On your screens, GDP, of course, coming in north of 4%. Quite a substantial beat looking at where the estimates were to just help us understand the context are guilty says our managing editor who's with us here on set up. Good set of numbers, good growth. Yeah, I mean, look, I think, you know, you're looking at GDP growing at the fastest pace in two years in the third quarter. So obviously some pretty robust figures there. But what you're really looking at here, David, is that the economy did seem to continue to build some momentum, and that's after some of the most severe of the Trump tariffs were actually lifted. So there was a little bit of a reprieve there, not really a ton of impact sort of you're seeing from, you know, some of you know, some of the some of their political issues. I think, you know, we're likely to look at is sort of that continued sort of strength as you as you start to head into 2026. I think the consumer confidence divergence, though, is quite interesting. Maybe tells you a little bit, David, about how the way that people actually spend, because, you know, part of the strength in these GDP figures was really because there was more consumer spending. But, you know, maybe there's a divergence there in how people were actually spending versus how they feel about the economy. I mean, certainly, you know, some concerns there in those consumer confidence numbers about, you know, the labour market going into 20, 26 tariffs, that kind of thing. But at least, you know, that's not showing up in the spending figures just yet. So tells you a little bit there. Yeah, just some breaking news right now. So a judge has upheld the White House's 100,000 fee on H-1B visas, of course, which is a story, of course, that made a lot of waves globally when it was first introduced out of the White House. And it seems to be that will remain the case moving forward. Jill, are you going to comment on this or should we talk about the weakness indication because we know that what it means for the Fed, it's your choice. Yeah, I think we can probably move on to the Fed has been kind of slow to digest, you know, exactly where this kind of goes in terms of the court decisions here for this visa rule. But when we're talking about the Fed here, I think some really interesting comment. Obviously, we're all kind of on tenterhooks waiting for Trump to actually announce whoever his Fed chair nominee is going to be. You've got really the latest comments from Trump. I think we're very, very, you know, in line with what we've come to expect from him, essentially saying that no matter what the economy is doing, essentially he wants whoever his Fed chair pickers who really, really rally for cutting rates, obviously, like, you know, I think some divergence there with, you know, some market fundamentals certainly over the last several decades. It's not about the economy. But I think that, you know, what we're really hearing from Trump is just that he is so adamant about wanting to have somebody in that position who is going to do what Trump wants him to do. Right. Like, I think you've got he he wants lower interest rates and he wants to install somebody that's actually going to tackle that. Of course, David, I mean, we've talked I don't even know how many times about the fact that, you know, it's obviously not just the Fed chair himself that, you know, makes those types of decisions. You know, you have to rally the rest of the FOMC around you to sort of bring something forward. But it does indicate, obviously, you know, Trump is really, really, really wants a Federal Reserve that's essentially going to do what he wants. Does he get that in 2026? I think it is. It is just one vote to the point you're making. Right. So just looking at the dots, too. Thank you so much, Jill. Fantastic. Jill, is there a managing editor now we might not even need to crowbar in lower rates, Right, because there is a case to be made for lower rates. In fact, post these numbers that that that did come out, of course, on consumer confidence, specifically our team at Bloomberg Economics. Let me just paraphrase this and shorten it quite simply. Is that because of the consumer confidence numbers in a weaker side of things, they're a function of labor market health, which is important to the Fed at this point in time. Given that mandates plural, they do expect more rate cuts, an easing in 2026. Right. Speaking of 2026, a market outlook for next year with these markets coming up here and why they think Chinese markets are just starting to win over some long, all the investor that's coming up counting down to the open of trade, Shanghai, Shenzhen and here in Hong Kong, this is the China show. Good morning. Good morning. 17 minutes to the opening bell again, a reminder that it's a shortened session here in Hong Kong today. I think we're at lunch and then, of course, that allows us to ease our way into the stillness of Christmas Eve. Well, I guess depending on what your plans are, certainly in my end, it's going to be it's going to be quiet copper on your screens, of course. And we'll talk more about the commodities rally. But certainly when you look at the commodity complex and the overlay on equity markets, resource heavy markets did also do very, very well this year. Right? Whether that's precious metals, you have copper, that's an air power play as it pertains to the air, obviously has been doing very well. A record low right now across these benchmarks. Asia Pacific, those up 3/10 of 1% this 24th of December to get an outlook for next year. Vanessa Shu is here with us on set, co-founder and CEO at VZ Partners, Hong Kong. Good morning. Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you again. America Christmas. Yes, I'll do it again. Okay. The this year has really been dollar weakness. Stocks have done well. Yes, m m has done well. Do you think m still have room to rally with against the backdrop of just things are no longer as cheap as they were at the start of the year broadly? Well, I think the m good performers will continue because of the fundamentals are driving earnings expansions and driving credit expansions when dollar is going to a easing cycle regardless of, you know, how much and how fast and out of that cuts. Well provide a liquidity support. And the DM market, particularly the US economy is healthy albeit to some cyclical slowdown. So so that provides the demand support for the market. And you know, there is a difference of this growth cycle, which is it is the DM, particularly the US debt has undergone massive expansion on infrastructural constructions of, you know, manufacturing sites, data centers and an expansion in industrial assets and a rebuild capital formation. So that's going to have a demand effect on the EAME supplies. So exports are going to stay healthy, which, you know, the supply from industrial will turn that into consumer spending. Power grows, wage growth in middle income households and wallets and growing. So that's going to provide a fundamental healthy support for. M What if the Fed what is the Fed doesn't cut any more? What if what if they've ended it? Even if the Fed doesn't cut? I think, you know, the we have posted the peak rates perhaps. Right. And inflation expectation has been so far well anchored. Even if the Fed doesn't cut the US fiscal expansion is there and the liquidity is changing from, you know, monetary liquidity that flows into the financial markets, to fiscal liquidity that flows into the real, real industries, to the main street rather than Wall Street. Right? So Wall Street is asset price inflation and Main Street is a real economy expansion, which is going to support demand. I think also the DM has to survive. The PE creates a balance sheet, has been improving, profitability has been solid and cash flow has been solid after corporates has survived of the of the of the PE career to remember two or three years ago we were worried about the debt refinancing was that the cooperative couldn't survive the post-COVID post-COVID world and you have to we had at the peak rates so that and bankruptcy did not go up. Yeah and corporates have fundamental research has survived that cash flow around the price of profitability below. Okay. So that's going to support the M demand. For example, you know, India is perhaps a lagging in the, you know, M with the size, but fundamentally I think India will be picking up in terms of less restrictive of a regulatory environment, more liquidity, because the central bank has cut and the solid households consumption grows. But but India, just to play the devil's advocate, has underperform. For him this year because it neither has a strong air component in the market, nor does it have, nor is it a very resource heavy index, for example. Right, right. So that's the case for India. The two prominent sectors performed very well that India is relatively weaker, but fundamentally, India is at that credit expansion cycle. Is that infrastructure building cycle, the housing market, which an economy housing market is a pillar for the for the economy. After ten years of a down cycle, India as a housing market is booming. Therefore, it will have a, you know, impact on consumption, impact on construction, impact on, you know, durable goods such as the cars and appliances, etc.. So the fundamental has been there. I think MSCI India's earnings growth has been revised up and the financial sector, industrial sector and has been doing very well. So maybe next year. I think India is a is a is a worse look on a relative a value basis. And particularly given the other market has gone up pretty a bit in market. Can I ask you about China? Sure. There's a big swing in attitude from this, an investable tag to certainly a lot of global investors have not only increased allocations, they've asked they've at least explicitly talked about wanting to also increase their allocations even further. There's still question marks. Yes, I think the point you made and I think the point you're making is China does not have to be in a bull market. It just doesn't need we just don't want to be in a bear market. As things stand, you see more allocations going into China next year, even if the macro stays the same. Well, you mentioned one thing, but one thing and the doing there is a gap. So when the mind to begin to change, it takes time, particularly for large, very fundamental lam money to realize perhaps the risk allocation was too bearish and too little for China to actually add a you know, I see or see out office level to change the risk allocation and take actions. All of that takes time. So I think China rebounded the sense that September 24 last year. So it's slightly more than a year and that ended the export industrial compound remained remained healthy, although domestic economy still have some headwinds. So it has triggered the people to deeply rethink about geoeconomics, a rethink about how to look at a China as a fundamentals. And and that takes time I think as long as next year. It is not a bear market that even if it doesn't, the market doesn't go up as much. It will have a and people will allocate it to China more particularly in a broader context. As we mentioned the M still, this is the logic is the GM component and the for sizable capital to deploy to GM, china has to be a you know, Moscow. Is it a better play next year do you think? Is it a benchmark play China I think it's a it's an alpha play. So look at the economy. There is a buy faction. Advanced industrials are cheap, making the semiconductor related to value chains are doing very well. It will continue to do well. And we see a very healthy and strong high quality pipelines of IP also coming to Hong Kong or domestic market for them or for that matter. But on the other side, the consumption remains still, you know, a little bit weak and real estate continue to have dragging, in fact, on the traditional economies, too. So it's a it's a also alpha market for stock pickers. And it's it's a play mainly in Hong Kong because Hong Kong has had, to your point, massive IPOs this year. It's been a very, very good year. And I think you think the world under appreciates the fact that the market structure in Hong Kong is changing Correct. And the market structure trend in meaning that, you know, Hong Kong used to be perceived as, you know, massive state owned companies, the traditional banks and and insurances. And the Hong Kong is lacking innovation and innovation goes to a stop order in China in Shenzhen. But now look at Hong Kong. It has a very well-rounded industry combination of the new issuances and the reassurances. So you can find the leadership almost across board of all industries. So so the innovation force is driving the Hong Kong IPO market to end. The world has not to realize the data. Give it another year. To the world where it will not stand a very strongly. The Hong Kong market structure has fundamentally changed. Okay. Yeah, we we're out of time. We didn't get to talk about private credit alternatives and fixed income. No doubt we'll have more time for that next year. Vanessa, very nice to see you. Very nice to see you, too. A merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mary Kay. Hi to the team for us as well. Vanessa Schuh, their co-founder and CEO at VZ Partners here in Hong Kong. We are flat on a Hang Seng at the open A50. Futures are down about a quarter of 1%. Plenty more heads. A preview of the session. This is the China show. Good morning. Right. Welcome back. Going into the open today. So the seven level on the currency, we're close. It will need to be a fairly statistical aberration esque date to take us below seven. On Dollar China, we'll talk about Sihanouk and MGM China in a moment. We've talked at length already about precious metals. There's a seven year bond. I think it's 8 billion renminbi today and of course, early closed. So we open at nine and then I think we shot at 12. So 3 hours for today. All that is to say it doesn't even matter if the market is open. Right, because investors have largely checked out. So we talked about falling vol and turnover, 15 day moving average on a Hang Seng index turnover charts coming up on your screens Green circle well Christmas theme right green circle is the was the peak this year that's the deep sneak moment from that low and red is where we are and we're at the lowest level at going back to about the start of the deep signalman, right almost come full circle on turnover. But again, on price itself, we are we're certainly holding up near the higher end of this year's range. And Hang Seng index, in fact is on a very note. Have a look at where we are here. $26 in, let's call it that Hang Seng Tech on your screens, dollar China and Hang Seng China. So we're slightly and I'm being generous clearly going into the the open today. The opening bell coming up next. 3 minutes away. This is the China show. Good morning. Right. Each and every day, while not each and every day. Let's call it more. More often than not. You know, I get reminders of how blessed I am to be covering a region as diverse as the Asia Pacific. While we were looking at Japan for potential intervention, we were looking at China for a potential break of seven. What happened was the Koreans came out and gave us those conversations to have separately. But yet that is just to say, of course, lots of stories to get into as we wrap up. Even a very, very quiet session in the equity markets is a massive move down in dollar one today. We were, I think 1.3, 1.4% to the downside there on dollar one. Okay. That is also to say that it has been a outside of that. It's been a it's been a weak dollar story going into that one story this morning. Dollar's weaker, a third day. You had the fix in at 701. I've talked about this in case you missed that, that's about a one Sigma move away on a daily basis that takes us below seven. That doesn't seem to be anything on the agenda. Clearly, we don't know what we don't know, but doesn't seem to be anything that is visible that might act as a catalyst for a one Sigma move down in Dollar China today, as you look at the bond yields and as we changed a page, just a reminder that we have a seven year CGP auction today. Keep an eye on that 88 billion me on offer tend to 1% of the upside just 200 short of the 2600 level on the Hang Seng index. It's quite as far as sector news. There's chips and of course there's drones, which I think we can get to later on as far as the movers go. Obviously, precious metals, that's a separate but related stories. See NOOK is up 3/10 of 1%. Another oil discovery in the Bohai Sea. Not much reaction in the market today one debut coming through ding bought Jan sent on your screens were up 200 plus percent. Beyond that, I can't tell you more really that's a first day of trade so let's put the page please. But suffice to say it's another good day, good trading day. Blue chip stocks in focus. There we go, SMI c up 4.3, while Hong is up about 4%. This has been a fairly consistent move, by the way, since the more threads unveiling their new product on the weekend and that we talked about gold right 4500s on spot silver is up 7172 so it about 70% Silver's up by double Jiangxi copper 1.4%. Putting everything together as far as the copper story is concerned, 12%, 12,000. Iron, copper. There we go. Thank you. 12 one And of course, also, I think we're at 90,000 on a Shanghai contract. Let's bring in our cross assets. Reporter Richard Henderson. He's in Melbourne for us today. Richard, good morning, sir. Thank you for coming on the show. Cross It has been a very busy, busy area this year. Take your pick. Where do we start going into next year? What's top of mind for you, sir? I think stocks is a great place to start. You know, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up 27% for the year so far when you include dividends. And part of it is a dollar story. You know, weakening dollar does flatter some of those returns. But I think underlying that is a great technology story and it really is easy to point to deep sea at the start of the year that showed investors and it comes up all the time when I'm talking to chief investment officers and portfolio managers in the region. It really underscored the type of possibilities and talent that's on offer in China, but also in places like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, where from a hardware and software point of view, it's so tightly integrated into the global technology supply chain and often at a far greater, more attractive valuation, let's say, than the United States. And we see those persistent concerns around the max seven valuation story, for instance. So I think going into 2026, we're going to see investors really like to to build out their tech exposure in Asia, to build on some of those gains and to potentially try and serve up the AI theme at a cheaper price point, basically. Yeah, If you just got out, you don't need to look cross. I said just look across the Pacific And any concerns over valuations, you know, after, you know, after a year and let's take Korea obviously isn't a very extreme example because I think that is the best performing index. And a lot of that has to do with high index and Samsung beneath the hood. After a year that after a year like Korea has had. Are there concerns over market concentration or valuations within that space? Just to maybe just close the door on that on that one? Definitely, Yeah. Those concerns are going to be very key to the to the, you know, the investment thesis for those single names and for the index. But I think we're not really seeing the same levels as we're seeing in the US where, you know, the Mag seven is some 33% of the S & P 500. Now, you know that that makes the, you know, the index so vulnerable to such a few companies. There's also great earnings underpinning some of these supplies in Asia. So so I think given that attractiveness of valuation relative to the US and other global peers, investors will still see a lot of value through through Asia Tech. So I expect that to continue into the new year. Okay. What about credit, sir? What's top of mind going into next year? Credit. Credit, Yeah. Investment grade dollar credit in Asia is heading for its best year since 2019. It's outperformed the US. It's a great, great year for Asia credit. And part of this is, you know, not not a huge gluts of supply and also pretty pretty attractive on the defaults, you know, very low defaults. So, you know, when we talk to portfolio managers, they really like Asia credit at that at that investment grade level. But also high yields had a great had a great year relative to the US. I think it's you know best year in seven from memory so so yeah Asia credit still very attractive and again it's you know it's partly reflecting the relative attractiveness to its global peers. But I think another another strong year for credit potentially in 2026. The it's quite an equity markets and now the news flow keeps keeps giving and I think that you know the Koreans we talked about this and I'm not sure if you heard the what happened there. Of course, the Bank of Korea just now talking about how the NPS was activated, new strategic effect hedging. But just to say, of course, very, very strong language coming through out of Korean authorities on the currency markets. What's obviously against the backdrop of a very weak dollar this year, does the weak dollar continue next year? And how what does that how does it activate regulators that might be maybe too worried over a too weak dollar, for example, or the opposite in the case I guess of of of of the Koreans. Exactly. And you can point to Japan as well. We had comments this week from the finance minister, I believe, reminding the market about the ability for official intervention. Listen, I think because of the Federal Reserve cuts that are forecast in the year ahead, we're going to see a pretty, pretty sort of persistent weakness in the outlook for the dollar. And again, relative to some of those Asian, Asian central banks, Australia and New Zealand, Japan, that are now shifting or already in a tightening cycle that will support their currencies. I think the yen, the dollar weakness trade should should endure until we start to see a shift in in US inflation or jobs. Richard. Fantastic. Thank you, sir. Richard henderson there in oz for us across assets. Reporter. Just very briefly, you know, for many people sorry, may be the hardest word. Not for us. We're sorry we made a mistake. The graphic that we showed you earlier on the show. Silver was up 400%. That did look kind of sketchy, though, to begin with. There's the correct graphic for you. Year to date, that's what we're doing in Silver gold spot and also copper. But you know what? Just to say, it's been a good year still. Right? Okay. Plenty more ahead. This is the China show. Welcome back. You watching the China show? Let's talk about strategic investments, talk about ports. Right. So China's invested, what, billions, billions and billions of dollars really in building ports right around the globe here, giving Beijing a strategic advantage given the trade and tensions conversation. It's breaking security, current concerns as well around the world. And our team at Bloomberg Originals, in fact, has taken a closer look at this trend. Every year, China imports about 66,000 metric tons of these. That's the weight of about six and a half Persian landmarks, or if you like, 440 blue whales. And most of these avocadoes come all the way from Peru. This journey used to take over a month. Now it's a straight shot cut in it by ten days. Why? One word, Megaport. And it's paid for by China. Chinese President Xi Jinping begins a week long South America tour, opening a China funded megaport in Peru. This is a huge investment not only for Peru but in Latin America. And it is expected to triple agricultural exports of Peru over the last 20 years. China has built up a network of about 100 ports on every continent except Antarctica, clustered around key maritime choke points, which are crucial to global trade. This gives China a strategic advantage as global trade tensions rise. But it's also sparking concerns, even though these ports, by and large, commercial ports, some of them do actually have the capacity to host naval vessels. So why did China build a global ports empire? And should Washington be worried about it? Without ports, the global economy pretty much grinds to a halt. Roughly about 80% of global trade is conducted via ships, and ports are crucial to that. Six of the ten busiest ports in the world are located in China. And 95% of the nation's trade is done by sea. China has made itself rich by being able to find markets overseas for its manufactured goods and being able to ship raw materials to China to be processed. So making sure that it has access to a network of global ports is a key part of that. And it's not only ports. China is also the world's biggest maker of container ships, making these generational investments to dominate global trade infrastructure. It's a central pillar of the Belt and Road Initiative. Over the years, it has become President Xi Jinping's signature global initiative, with the goal to strengthen or improve global connectivity through building up infrastructure projects. This has meant modernizing the ancient Silk Road with highways and rail, while securing maritime pathways in and out of China. Since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese entities investment in overseas ports have accelerated both in terms of scale and numbers. This map shows Chinese entities have invested in 129 port projects, totalling over $60 billion from Tanzania and Australia to Nigeria and Cambodia. This dwarfs investments made by any other country. There is no US government initiative that tries to finance or build port projects overseas. China has an entire ecosystem of companies from cement firms, iron steel firms that specialize in building out ports. Those are not industries where the U.S. has been focused in recent years. But the level of Chinese ownership over its ports varies. China's global network is made up of a series of different forms of ownership by Chinese state run companies and also Chinese private companies. In most cases, they team up with multinational or local companies to build and run the ports, even though the land is still owned by local governments. 17 of the ports China has invested in have majority Chinese ownership, which could offer Beijing more leverage at those sites, such as prioritizing container ships from a certain country or denying the docking of ships from other countries. But China has little reason to disrupt global trade. Which takes us back to the first megaport we mentioned at Junkee in Peru. 60% is owned by China's state run shipping company COSCO, and 40% by an entity controlled by an Argentine investor. Chiang Guy is located around 40 miles north of Lima, and in its final phase, the main area of the ports is expected to be around 700 acres, which is about 80% the size of Central Park. So the port itself is huge. This port is part of China's large infrastructure push in Latin America. Currently, three out of four of the biggest economies of South America, a trade war with China than the U.S.. In fact, a third of all the containers exported by Peru are sent to China, carrying not only these favorites, but other agricultural products and minerals as well. So this makes Peru a crucial gateway into China for Brazil, Chile and other countries. The initial investment was of $1.3 billion. But if there's more demand, Costco has said that it could invest $3.5 billion total for an expansion of the port. Chiang Kai is a deep water port, which means that shipments can take place directly from Shanghai to major Chinese ports. So that would enable journeys to be cut down, costs to be reduced, trade to be increased between South America and China. US officials have criticized this for telling Peruvian authorities that they should not have allowed a Chinese firm to create such a big investment in the region. But Peruvian officials have countered, saying that the US hasn't been willing to make such a big investment in Peru. As we know by now, this is not just a story about overseas investment. It's also about national security. A number of Trump officials have even suggested that the port could be dual use, meaning that at some stage it could be used not just for economic activity, but for military activity, too. That's something that Peruvian officials strongly deny and that China denies, too. But these concerns are not unfounded. Well, U.S. intelligence says China's first overseas military base in the tiny African country of Djibouti is likely to be followed by several more in Djibouti. What began as a commercial port eventually turned into China's first full fledged overseas military base. Remember this map of the 17 ports with Chinese majority ownership, 14 have potential for both commercial and military use, meaning it can a service of commercial ships, LNG tankers, oil tankers. And it might also have the physical capacity to host fueling ships, logistics, ships for military purposes or a military battleship. China only has one overseas naval base so far as compared to the several that the US has dotted around the world. In fact, the U.S. also has a naval base in Djibouti, along with at least 127 other overseas military bases. Chinese officials strongly denied that the ports are for military use. But still, many countries around the world are concerned that these Chinese port operators could in turn become listening posts to what the economies that are surrounding these ports are doing. But the more immediate concern is that China could leverage these ports in a trade war. China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back. For the U.S. the Panama Canal is really a crucial economic lifeline. Something like 5% of global trade travels through the canal and 40% of U.S. contain the traffic flows through it. Without that ability to easily pass between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans through that corridor, U.S. trade will be very much impacted. Two of the ports on either side of the canal are owned by Hong Kong based conglomerate S.K. Hutchison. To all intents and purposes, Beijing doesn't have direct control over Hutchinson. But the very fact that the key executives at these companies may have direct relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, that really makes a lot of Western governments uncomfortable. A foreign power today possesses through their companies, which we know are not independent. The ability to turn the canal into a choke point, and that is a direct threat to the national interests and security of the United States. China has said that it has always respected Panama's sovereignty over the canal and that it firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices. Yet it has also pushed back against a deal that would give control of Hutchinson's Panama ports to American asset manager BlackRock, calling the deal a betrayal of national interests. The European Union has introduced investment screening regulations which make it much more difficult for China to buy out critical infrastructure, including ports across the continent. A tit for tat over docking fees has also been rippling through the shipping industry. Washington has also suggested that all this Chinese money comes with heavy strings attached. But if you talk to officials in Nigeria, Peru, beyond, there's a feeling that, look, we need this infrastructure. It's important for our economic modernization plans. And China is the only game in town offering it. Ultimately, we're going to see a reshaping of global trade flows because maritime trade has become more and more political. Enjoy that. Yeah, fantastic stuff. And work, of course, out of our team at Bloomberg Originals as subscribers, by the way, can watch that specific one and others, of course, on the terminal it's also on the website on Bloomberg dot com. China has certainly emerged as one of the key markets this year. That's imports do of course catch and read up on sure these call them today a fantastic one. Repeat after me. Never ever underestimate China of course in terms of what happened this year. Trade war, air developments, everything in between. The latest article in Focus is on why one should not undertake that exercise. You can read about that on terminals. Well also on the Bloomberg dot com. Right. Welcome back, Chips and Focus. Well, a couple of things is obviously. One is the US has, at least for now, pushed back the prospect of duties and that following, of course, the review. The second one comes down to what the security news reported late last night. And also, as you might see, in fact, raising some prices, some products by 10%. More on those stories coming through in the next hour of the China show. Welcome back. You're watching a China show half an hour into the Twas the Night Before Christmas, as they say. And certainly volumes are screaming that fact out when you look at turnover turning down volumes at this point in time of the day, we're about 48% lighter than than the month's average. Price swings are obviously going to be exacerbated. But that's just to say, of course, markets have effectively checked out for for the year. And it's been a really, really, really good year to be long. Major assets like stocks, precious metals. We get into all of that, of course, in the next hour of the China show. And of course, Bill is standing by in Sydney for us to help drive the ship in the next hour. Bell drive the ship for the last show before Christmas. And definitely here in Australia people have well and surely clocked off by now. But we are going to be bringing you all of the market moves over the coming hours and just starting us off in the session today. I mean it's it's pretty strong and and we have really eventually got that Santa Claus rally, it seems, just given what we had on Wall Street. It's translated eventually across to the Asian benchmarks in this session, with the exception actually of the ASX 200 standing out to the downside this morning. But it is that continued theme you see around tech, in particular metals and Vietnamese stocks. We're also tracking those ASX. You get the Vietnamese stocks first because as you were saying, Dave, I saw your email you sent earlier, this is by far the best performing benchmark globally. Over the past few weeks you're seeing gains of around 7%. But even in the session today, very strong moves and this is really perhaps a little bit more political clarity coming to the fore here because we may be soon set to get a new picture, a clear picture of the new top leaders for the country as well. Metals, as I mentioned, because very strong moves across the board in in the likes of copper, palladium, platinum, rather silver, gold. I mean you're seeing platinum record highs, silver above $70 an ounce at 4500 on gold spot as well, copper about 1200 thousand a tonne for the first time ever. Very strong moves really with these expectations around Fed easing into next year. There are some tariff risks as well that are coming to the fore, particularly for those copper prices but also taking a look in the currency space because again, as you said, Dave, you get that seen in trading, it leaves you open maybe to some more stronger moves. And the Korean one is maybe reflecting a bit of that today, but it is strengthening. And that's after authorities said excessive weakness in the currency is not desirable. So some strong determination to act. I mean, we didn't we just got that early this week as well with from the finance minister in Japan. But certainly you have those government officials in North Asia prepared to step in. Absolutely. In fact, Mark Cranfield is standing by for us to help us understand the context here in terms of what's happening broadly, of course, risk assets. And we talked about the markets and the complications suddenly of us looking elsewhere. Mark, we were talking about the we were looking elsewhere for intervention. Japan is a good example. We were talking about seven on the Chinese currency. And then the Koreans came out and said, hey, look at us. How do we need to be looking at this risk? Well, the Korean timing is very clever indeed, because they obviously were waiting to some extent for a for a change in the Japanese currency. The two are usually pretty closely linked together. So since we've already had Katayama, the finance minister, helping the yen to get a little bit stronger, the Korean authorities are following up. And the timing is also good because if you look at the the performance of the dollar against the Korean one over the past year, you'll see that when it gets close to the 1480 kind of area, which it is approaching today, that's a pretty important pivot area. And if they had allowed it just to drift even beyond that, by the time we come back in January, we could have a very weak currency indeed. And it might be beyond their control to do anything about it. So very important that they step in when they did. And if you look at the measures that they've announced today, that the key one is the one that's aimed at individual investors, there's been there's been talk for quite a while. The Koreans have been sending a lot of money to the US to buy tech stocks in America. It seems that the individuals in Korea, they love American big tech names, people like Tesla and India, all those kind of players. And there is so much money stored up in the US dollar via the equity market, the Korean authorities, and now encourage them to bring it back to Korea and do so at advantageous levels as well. So clearly it is very much aimed at getting money back into Korea to support the Korean currency. So very good timing from their point of view. So the chances of them drawing a line under the weakness in the currency is pretty good as they go into year end, and they should be able to start the new year on a much better footing than they would have done if they just allowed it to drift around. Let's talk about, I guess, some other implications of that weaker dollar story as well, because you've got gold that's about 4500 an ounce for the first time. What does that tell you and what's the direction for metals going into next year? Because a lot of these moves, I mean, again, at record levels. Yeah. I mean, that's a that's a double edged thing there. So General, US dollar weakness usually is good for precious metals, especially gold, but you're seeing it branch out way beyond this going into, as you say, into silver, platinum and other places as well. So on the one side is a dollar story, but on the other side, clearly geopolitics is playing a pretty big role as well. The fact that the United States and Venezuela, the situation there is pretty tense, could even deteriorate further. People are concerned about that. I think you still got a lot of unresolved issues in other parts of the world. There seems to be no sign that Russia and Ukraine are going to have a truce there either. So there's plenty of reasons when you look across the world, if people want to be nervous, if they want to be defensive, then obviously going into gold and other places is pretty good. And then you get the double whammy effect because the dollar is falling as well. And in the background, the treasury curve is pretty stable. And one of the few things that can derail the gold rally would be if suddenly we get a big jump in Treasury yields. That doesn't seem to be happening right now. People still think the Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates again next year. So all the conditions are very much in favor of gold and silver, staying on a pretty good track for the time being. Mark, I'm just taking a look at crypto prices and Bitcoin in particular. It's actually pretty incredible given all the optimism we had around crypto going into 2025 and the expectations of where it would end the year, it's actually managed to go lower by around 8%. What does that mean? I think if you if you've been following what we're saying on Markets Live for the past few months, crypto is a side story. I think people there's enough happening in major currencies, inequities in global fixed income markets. There's enough asset classes which are looking very, very interesting. Crypto is a sideshow. People are just moving their money away from it. It's increasingly becoming less relevant to what happens in the other markets. It's no longer really across asset story. It's out there on its own. There are people that like crypto. They want to be involved. The read across for other major assets is becoming less and less all the time. So with that background you can have crypto continuing to slide lower. And frankly, bond traders have exchanges. They don't really care. Really great love that mark that was out in life strategies that mark rounds out Cranfield rather in Singapore and I think just saying that there's a lot more interesting asset classes to attract leads us perfectly into our guest we've got Masahiko Lui joining us senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors Semester. I mean you just heard Mark telling us straight, there's there's just too many more captivating stories in in markets to grab traders and investors. What's most interesting for you in the fixed income space. I think fixed income space, right, is a Korean income story. We have seen a lot of, you know, sell off in fixed income, especially at the market. And e market, too, is a pretty interesting place to be for next year. And then there's a lot of talks about diversifying away, not divestment, again, from U.S. Treasuries right into different parts of the world. We have, you know, m as a substitute. We have seen investors, you know, willing to go. You have been investors trying to move in to a bit of foreign flows into JGBs actually lately. So I think you are going to next year fixed income is still a carry and income story and then with yield at this elevated level, I think it's a good entry point for investors with a long term investment perspective. So we're setting out maybe for a bit softer dollar story as well. What does that tell you about the preference for fit in versus down? I think for M market, you know, if you look at the total return year to date item, local currency has returned around 18% this year, one eight 18%. And if you look at something like global act, right, what we're aggregating throughout probably 8%, which is more carry and roll. And the reason why, you know, m local debt has outperformed is because of the all the weakness. We do think that, you know, with a slightly dovish fit into next year, we etc. we actually had a pretty consensus call of for cuts in 24 and 25. We had three cuts. This is from our chief economist Simona based in Boston. She had a pretty good call this year right. Despite all the ups and downs in the market where people pull back that rate cuts forecast, we stuck we stuck to our guns and then into next year we do forecast, you know, 2 to 3 more cuts off from the fat, you know, and that will probably impart a slightly weaker, you know, US dollar, maybe 5 to 7% weaker from here. And I think in the world, you know where you have Goldilocks growth and then a slightly weaker dollar and that will actually benefit him local currency debt as a whole, especially when you know a lot of this global investors, remember, they are very, very they are still underweight, you know, under emerging market debt. So it is an asset class that is underground. It pays high real yield. And then, you know, that's more room to appreciate versus the US dollar. Fantastic myself. Of course, we'll have more from Masahiko Lu in a moment there. We've largely had a look back at this year and sees some mighty supports some of the areas of the market that he likes going into next year. We're underweight globally, of course, as you can see across the fixed income space, high yield has done better than most. Does that continue to be the case in 2026? More on the outlook coming up next. This is the China shop. All right. Welcome back. You're watching the China Show, our final full broadcast, by the way, of the year. So it's Christmas. And let me let me find a way to crowbar my favorite Christmas movie of all time. And the conversations around to Fed. Might more FOMC members turn out to be doves? Actually. Masahiko Lu is still with us, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors Mazda. Thanks for sticking around. I think you just mentioned in the previous segment two or three rate cuts for next year. Almost everywhere has done well across the fixed income space, high yield and everything in between. When you look at consensus right now and you look at what markets most people are expecting, what could go wrong? I think next year, you know, the things that might go wrong is, you know, we do have like a bubble burst, albeit this is not our base scenario. Theme for next year is uncomfortably bullish. So we are still alone in risk assets and we do want to have some hedge do right. So if you have that, you know, a small bubble burst or we call it a momentum crash rather than burst. And and then there's also talks about your own carry treatment and one which is I don't think we will see that we might see a bit of, you know, periodically volatility but it's not the system is systemic or structural risk that that policy. So if we do have that, you know, small turmoil in the market, that's when, you know, risk assets will do worse. Right. And then that's when know hedges will come in and do well. And that's why we have seen investors, you know, locking into having traits that, you know, they are long risk like equities. And then, you know, if you long see, for instance, the short end of the US curve is a pretty good player. If, you know, risks plunge and fat wall will cut. Right. So that's a pretty good place to be for fixed income has its place, albeit not in the longer and a curve but the short end of the curve. And how does asset class or you know like fixed income that's has cheapened up a lot like GBS for instance. Right. If you do have a change in sentiment, I think that, you know, rewind that reversal would be pretty quick. And also, you know, you can sit on assets like, hey, just like gold, you know, and convertible bonds, right? We have seen actually investors, especially in the in European investors taking chips off a bit, you know, when it comes to US equities, right. Growth equities. And then if you are in converts, you do have that upside in equities and also you do have a downside protection of a bond. Like that's a tough time protection, right? So that's why we have seen, you know, a lot of industrials trying to have have hedges on. What fantastic advice, I think. Can I just pick up on one of the points you just made? It's the short end. So I think we've seen three straight years of the US curve specifically steepening. Do you see anything that upsets that, that that trend is are we going to get a fourth year steepening? I think we will get a fourth year of steepening into next year. You know, albeit, you know, a flattening is probably more of a 2027 story. Right. Even in Japan is the flattening is going to be a late 20, 26 story. But I think, you know, globally, you still have a lot of fiscal slippage and a lot of issuance in the longer end of the curve. You know, that be us Germany, including Japan's euro where I sit in. Right. And that's why we think that the curve is remains distorted albeit you know there's a lot of fixes or like tweaks being done. You know like you know you can cut a bit of the issuance on the back and issue more you know in the bill strikes or cut coupons and issue bills. A lot of this you know technical things can happen that could contain the steepness of the curve. But, you know, in general sense, I think a lot of people aren't comfortable sitting on a shot and then having to price a bit of term premium into the longer end. Yeah, I guess that's also a reflection around the yield curve outlook, just as of a lot of the spending that's tied to the big, beautiful bill that's going to kick in. And a lot of what we see in terms of CapEx investments as well as an investor in more of the corporate space. Is there any concern about some of those those bonds that are tied to air specifically? Sure. At State Street Investment management, you know, we actually we favor sovereign bonds over credit for the next year. Right. The reason why is because, you know, we have seen a lot of issuance, you know, funding aspiration of HYPERSCALERS in CapEx. And that will I think will drive, you know, spreads higher into next year, especially focusing on the type names that will basically drive, you know, spreads when it comes to like for instance, US IG rate is trading around 80 basis points, 75, 80 basis points at almost at all time tight. Right. We think, you know, the general travel direction of travel is to get spread a bit wider maybe, you know, 200, 120 when it comes to high yield, it's trading at 25 currently is also at all times tight. So, you know, there's only so much, you know, room for it to rally from here further to tighten further. So we do think that, you know, if we do have a bit of more cockroaches in the market per se and then more issuance, that will basically put on some pressure in the credit market. So we are favoring sovereign debt over credit and then we also favor M local that and other, you know, hedges like coal and converts. What about the the Japan debt market as well because I can see in your notes is saying JGBs look pretty cheap but sentiment does still remain pretty cautious as well. This is something very interesting talking to foreign investors. So me sitting in Japan so I cover impact on do travel to you know in the US and Europe from time to time talking to investors. You know, you have seen two types of investors right. Domestic and foreign foreign investors, they are getting more attracted to GGP market, albeit a lot of the money that flows into Japan from foreign is still in the fast money or you know that the ones that are active more tactical type of investors. We do sense that you know there's more and more of this the real real money right there, like the likes of the sovereign wealth funds, like your pension funds in the U.S.. Right. That has never been looking at JGB for the past three years because it's going at 0% right now. Suddenly it's yielding at par with Germany 30 years. Right. And then if you're a foreign investor, as you head you back to, you know, your foreign your own currency, home currency, you actually get the hedging premium, which is around one 200 to 200 basis points, you know, of of of attractiveness. And as a domestic investor in Japan, no one wants to catch a falling. Naturally, Japan banks are sitting on a lot of cash, ¥400 trillion of cash. Right. Those are the money that will be deployed in the job market. But speaking to investors in Japan, we have started to see this pick up of up interest. But then it is going to take a long, drawn process. You know, they have to wait until BOJ gets to closer to the terminal, which is we think round one 125 by early 2027. So, you know JGB that you get the structural buying from Japanese investors will be a 2026 later health story but you know before we get there you know a lot of entry points for investors to to to to get in when especially when the market you know GGP market sell off under a headline of increase issuance of fiscal slippage for us we think that you know Takeuchi if she has a choice I don't think she wants to be distressed right. I think she's going to be. MALONEY Like, you know how Italy has outperformed the market. I'm going I'm coming into this several quarters. Yeah, that seems to be an easy, easy choice of preference, let's put it that way. Can I just I mean, perfect, perfect segue way for. The JGB market, the KGB's. So obviously we've seen this yield yields cross because of the sort of Japan normalizing interest rates, the lack of inflation in China on our screens for our viewers. Must you say 2026 will be will be the becomes the verdict year on China's ability to exit deflation? Two part question Do you think they will exit deflation? And if they do, what's the trade? And by the way, third question why 2026? I think 25 freight has seen, you know, like look at the chart. Right. This is pretty surprising. I like to me is a Baltic expression. Baltic Chinese yield is trading underneath Japan. Right. Jiji It's actually doing one two GBS right. And I think 23 five is the year that, you know, investors have shifted away from thinking this segment of Asia is actually Japan for the past 30 years. Right now, once you know Japanese yield is next, nothing right now Japan is actually doing a lot better. There's a lot of foreign inflows in both JGBs and also Nikkei equities. Right. And if you talk to a lot of foreign investors, they are very actually pretty bullish when it comes to Japan, especially when it comes to macro growth and stuff. But shifting to China, I think, you know, is actually there's a lot of similarities, a bit of differences between Japan and China and what sitting in China, I'm looking at I'm sorry, sitting in Japan looking at China, I could see China is mimicking Japan back in the 1990, early 2000, right where Japan was in the early stage in this was going to last decades, I think 2026 is the verdict year because, you know, we have seen China's inflation improving a bit. Right. But still, you know, is still in a deflationary stage. And there's a lot of targeted spending, targeted growth initiatives done by the government. And 2026, you know, if anything we think is going to be a pivot in a year for them, if they could actually actually deflation and also induce a bit of growth in the market into its economy. But, you know, having putting every piece into the puzzle, we do think that, you know, trying to asset is still a pretty is is going to take a pretty long time for China right to to actually actually exit that whole deflationary and also growth on the mining mindset just because of how look in Japan right you have the demographics aging society and you have elevated debt And then the third one is, you know, secular decline in potential growth. China is doing better than Japan, right? Because they do have, you know, 45% potential growth. But then, you know, is there will be a lot of pressure, external pressure, too, on China. And we think that, you know, CGP is actually attractive trade to be whenever there is a sell off taking you know from the experience of Japan and Jeju market. Thank you, sir. Have a good rest of your week and holidays ahead myself. Masahiko Lu, the senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Tokyo, writes, We'll leave you with a look at markets and then we'll see you on the other side of this break. Welcome back. And some of the corporate stories that we're tracking this morning. We're watching Senate shares. That's after it announced a major oilfield discovery in the Bohai Sea. Sinovac says that Qinhuangdao 29, Dash six, holds 100 million tons of oil with the discovery well producing 2500 barrels of crude a day. China's Comac is set to miss its annual delivery target for a sea 919 single aisle jet by almost 50%. Data from Cirium and plane spotters dot net suggest Comac shipped just 13 of its flagship plane this year, well short of the target of 25 Planemakers expected to have received the SI 919 this year, including Air China and China Eastern. All right. Let's have a look at these markets. Chips and focus SMI here the news yesterday out of the that's near these times and that dovetails really into the well the well first the jump in the shares clearly and some prices and some products by 10% make the entry model Qualcomm. Sam is also on the up here, 1.2%. Taiwanese insurers also in focus today on the back of some changes in, I guess effects and that should be leading to some gains not all but we are coming off highs, if not completely reversing in some cases on some changes in accounting rules. Right. We'll take a short break and have a look at the Japanese. Close the market close in a moment. This is Bloomberg. It's 11:29 a.m. in Tokyo this morning. Japanese markets just about to go into their lunch break. We're not really seeing too much trading activity and we're seeing holiday thin trading across the board. No surprises. Why? Of course, it is Christmas Eve, but still, we are just seeing stocks inching marginally higher and that's after we had some pretty strong GDP figures out of the US overnight. That set us up nicely and played in again to that Wall Street session. Asian markets as well. Let's take a look at what's happening across the board today. As we said, it's it's very light in terms of of news stories, but still it's just some incremental moves here to the upside, still seeing that continued outperformance of tech there. And of course, the commodities rally is the other big story that we're tracking here, Dave. Yeah, it really is. In fact, we're going to get into that in a moment. I would really you know, as recently as a few weeks back, I thought we were kind of done with the rally. And then the last week happened and, you know, here we are, 45 and gold, 4500 silver, 72, platinum, copper, 12,000 of equity markets. Just very quickly, of course, in case you want to take if you're keeping tabs, best year since these years on your screens. Clearly, the Cosbys had a standout year. I think it's the best performing major benchmark globally and yet they're clearly the best on price this this this this century. In fact, the and the rethinking of its role specifically not so much as a tech play. That's been a that's been a consistent theme for for many years with the page but as a really vital cog to the air supply chain. God there we go. It's been you know, the fact that you have an underperformer, that the fact that gold has seen 50 record highs and it's still one of the underperformance relative to others like Silver just tells you how good, how good things have really been. BELL Yeah. And let's get more on that gold story. And commodities generally bring in our Bloomberg Metals and Mining reporter Martin Ritchie in Shanghai. So, Martin, was this something you had thought would be the case, would see 40 $500 an ounce by the end, by the end of the year? And and how does that set us up into next year when you still got more bullish calls saying 4840 900 is even possible. Yeah, it's been a pretty spectacular year for for gold. And since you asked for that. One of my colleagues was mentioning this morning that when he covered gold, you know, you could never imagine prices this level even two years ago. But here we are. And I think this December rally that you've seen in gold and in the precious metals is really a continuation of the same themes we've seen throughout this year. It's about. It's about the debasement. Trade is the growing sort of mistrust in traditional assets, the sovereign bonds and currencies. It's about the weaker dollar. It's a bit central banks buying gold because of those things, and it's about a little bit more private investor money coming into gold. But you have all that and then you have kind of low liquidity in the in the end of year season, which means that these kind of momentum trades can can take hold and spreads to other metals. We've obviously seen silver, platinum, palladium, all these precious metals that are very small markets and can make very big moves. We've seen those start to make pretty spectacular moves, in fact, in the last few days. Yeah. And you know, when they use a spectacular could sometimes be an understatement. It tells you how good things have been. Martin Leap Let's talk about copper. Obviously, the we all know about the supply issues there, the big the three big copper biggest copper mines in the world. Where is there? Well, when I look at the economic forecast for next year and this is the economic overlay, people seem to have a mixed view on whether the global economy will do better next year compared to this year. And I wonder whether there is an economic consideration when you look at Dr. Copper doing what it's doing to the upside. I would I would. I see this opportunity to talk a little bit about the downside for for for copper. You know, we're seeing this we're seeing this rally to 12,000 well past 12,000 already. And we're seeing this happening even as demand for copper is is quite weak, especially here in in China. We've seen over the past two months a really quite marked slump in demand and supply driven rallies, especially when they're driven by a kind of time limited thing like the prospect of us import tariffs are maybe not that reliable and is already a lot of people saying that 12,000 is just too high for copper. It's it's higher than where it should be relative to demand. If we look globally at supply, the market is not that tight. It's it's only because there's a lot of stuff going to the US two front run tariffs that you're getting this sort of slightly distorted sense of where prices are. So those are all reasons to be kind of a little bit more cautious. A guess about about next year with copper at these already very high levels. MARTIN Thank you. Mark Rich in in Shanghai for us, our metals and mining reporter there. Right. Just ahead here, we're having some when we talk about a closer look, really a close and deeper and comprehensive look at Seattle specifically. So the company has taken on new heights this year. It's setting its sights then on further expansion overseas. But there are some speed bumps and bottlenecks ahead, including politicians and Donald Trump in the way. Details on that story just ahead. This is Bloomberg. You're watching the China show and taking a look at some stocks that are moving very strongly to the upside today. These are smart driving stocks listed in on the mainland. But but the story here and the reporting we're actually getting from Xinhua is that the that Beijing city has issued the first batch of license plates for all three autonomous vehicle operating on expressways. Now, to put it in perspective, L three technology, it's when the technology of the vehicle becomes significantly more autonomous. So at this point, maybe you can have a car that can really perform all driving tasks at some point, maybe where humans can start to recline a little bit in their seats and focus on other tasks. That's what the technology is capable of. A step below what you see Robotaxis operating at today, which is L4 but definitely above L2. The way we see in terms of basic adaptive cruise control lane centering other sorts of technologies as well. Dave, you know, when you mentioned L2, and I think a lot of people will well appreciate this jump in my in my head it's l2l3l4. It just makes me think about my discs and my lower back. Right. So L4 L5 a lot of people have heard her animations and I'll just borrow of course, people people like me. We do need, of course, reclining seats when you do have bad backs, right, Because they alleviate some of the pressure on your L4, L5 sometimes even that's one OC anyway. That's okay. Let me. How did I get myself into this corner? Let me pull myself out of this hole and then pivot back, get back on the road. Talk about Seattle, the world's biggest EV maker, with a fantastic big take today on this. Get this, the company has powered one in three cars sold this year. That's according to data from South Korean based energy research. But as growth slows domestically, the company is now looking abroad for expansion. Let's bring in our transport reporter here, Linda Loo, to talk us to today's big take. Let's talk about, pun intended, the road ahead and the road overseas here for the company before we talk about the challenges. Yeah. So Seattle is making a really big push into Europe as already built two factories, one in Germany, one in Hungary where it's producing batteries to supply to us clients like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes on the continent is building a third factory in partnership with Stellantis and Spain. So it's really ramping up presence in Europe. What's in the way and the way is a uneven demand. You're seeing that in China. You're also seeing a little bit of that In Europe. We just saw the EU essentially kind of scale back the commitments to phasing out sales of petrol and diesel cars by in the near future. So that step back, combined with some of European countries like Germany and France scaling back incentives to support EV purchases, could in the long run kind of slow down this demand for EVs. But I think Seattle is banking that the transition towards EVs will might be uneven, but it's not going away. So is really putting its production capacity on the line there. What can it do in terms of containing costs as it looks to expand, then, if it really doesn't have any other choice but continue to look to your really. Yes, that's right. Europe has a really important market for car sales, as well as EVs outside of China. You're probably seeing the biggest source of demand from the European continent. And another big factor is the higher prices that even makers can command in Europe. So that's really going to help boost the margins of these manufacturers, especially considering at home there's a price war that's being waged for the Chinese companies. So Seattle is also hoping to capitalize on some of those higher margins in Europe. On the flip side, as factories that's operating in Germany, maybe possibly Hungary is actually at a lower efficiency and probably at a higher cost compared to factories at home in China. So it's kind of a balancing act that needs to address as it develops. And the European markets, not so much a focus, I guess, for this piece, but just generally, can you help us understand as well for next year for Seattle, the the importance of of energy storage systems as well to the business, given you've got maybe some weaker or more mature demand already for the EV battery side. Yes, Energy storage systems is actually a market that a lot of people are banking on for fast growth, especially now as the demand for API and data centers are surging. So having these storage systems, I think these data centers will really help manage the energy demands that these operations will have. So Seattle has already made a lot of groundwork and foundations for producing energy solar storage systems, not only in China but in the US is actually very interesting. They are pivoting together with Ford to go into this energy storage energy storage systems market with Ford hoping to leverage the licensing deal it has, or Seattle to start providing those type of products. That's actually an area that you have if you make makers like Tesla already very strong and in the space. So it'll be really interesting to see how Seattle can kind of gain a little bit of access into the US market through partnerships like this. Linda, great reporting. That was Bloomberg's Linda Liu there in Hong Kong talking about today's big take, which is China's battery giant needing new markets after dominating at home. And on that point and continuing Seattle we actually spoke to earlier this year and the company told us that it's making overseas expansions its top priority in light of what Linda was saying. But amid an intense for domestic competition, its chief manufacturing officer spoke with Stephen Engle, our chief North Asia correspondent at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin early this year. Irrational competition. I will call it everyone but industrywide. And the government knew this is a problem in this House. This will destroy the industry. So there is a lot of a sentiment to come up with a regulation and a policy to prohibit this kind of price war. And as a result, that also forced everybody to dig in. Can you further improve your internal efficiency and so maintain reasonable business margin to survive, to continue to innovate? So for that part doubt, I expect there will. How are you doing that? How are you? We are proving good efficiency. We are trying to do everything improve the production utilization. How is I employed? They asked me used to actually see it has been using embracing the air revolution maybe seven, eight years ago. At that time it really started from simple repetitive task and manual work. They tried to use air to capture, to do more efficient work, and now we not only use AI to screen the material because the different material, different chemistry and also different design, and also during the stage of manufacturing and also after the sales. So air has been utilized to improve and make sure the processes are stable is in the control. Over the next 5 to 10 years, what would your ideal. Next generation super battery factory look like? Well, I would say in the next five years, ideally, let's take on all the trade barriers. All the consideration ideally should be green, number one, because we want to save our planet. The factory we actually already do extensive improvement. We reduce our energy consumption, reduce any of the emission and circulate any of the waste of material we recirculate into our production. That is number one. Number two, it should be a smart so that any human labour intensive, dangerous task should be taken care by machines, by robots, by computers. So that's what we are saying also should be reconfigurable, because when you put that down, this is a capital intensive facility where you put the production line you don't want to see, oh, after year the product, the end product, our consumer, our customers, the vehicle don't sell well. So we would like to switch that to a different vehicle. But can you quickly flexibly adjust, adapt to the new product? So that's our effort. We tried to make it as a user friendly as possible. How do you avoid the pitfalls of overcapacity that is affected the solar industry right now? And a lot of people in the industry are fearing that maybe there's going to be a battery overcapacity in the coming years. How do you feel about. Well, we don't look at that. We believe it when the global community going to a green sustainable award and there's a surge, the demand is drastically increasing. The key is a high quality battery. Of course, you can't if you don't put that high standard, you can put a cheap battery. That capacity maybe is are plentiful. But the consumer and our basically a workhorse OEM in the car industry energy company, they demand a high quality save and a long life battery for that it's there's a shortage. Otherwise we would not go to many parts of the world to make those high quality batteries. Would you say going overseas now because of the high demand demand? Well, there's obviously I wouldn't say the market is saturated in China yet, but there's a price war, obviously, which is brutal. Would you say, though, that your number one priority is kind of figuring out the international expansion, that sort of the best, I guess, algorithm for making it work? Is that your number one priority? Yes. And that was in June there. The chief manufacturing officer at the company with exclusively with a colleague, Stephen Engle. That conversation was back a few months back. The safety has really been and staying largely on theme here, it really has been a major concern for the industry this year following a fatal crash of a show me car that then led to a nationwide uproar. Steve also had a look at the story. He took a test track, took to a test track in Shanghai where Seattle is looking to make charging faster and also safer. Seattle likes to think of itself as doing sort of the dirty work of building electric vehicles, not only where the rubber meets the road, but where the charge is put into the chassis. Seattle's so-called skateboards are a modular cell to chassis product that integrate the battery cells under the floorboards with the chassis engine, drive, train and other modules. Seattle's many car brand customers then build out their own flashy bodies on top, and this stripped down and top off skateboard skeleton is not just for show. It rips on the test track. Our test drive took place just as Seattle touted it can now offer 520 kilometres or 323 miles of range from an industry best just 5 minutes of charging time. Total game changer. Because with that technology and then the infrastructure that follows behind it, range anxiety should be a thing of the past. Seattle has more than one third of the world's EV battery manufacturing capacity. They can scale it. Analysts say this will be the year in China when EVs finally outsell internal combustion engine passenger cars for the first time. But tragedy also has recently accompanied that rapid growth. In late March, a shammy SUV, seven traveling at high speed on an expressway with self-driving reportedly switched on, plowed into a concrete wall and caught fire, killing three people. The Shell Me accident really put the focus on EV safety, not only with autonomous driving, but with battery safety. This is the Seattle first generation of the skateboard chassis. Underneath are the batteries. The next generation called the bedrock, is promising at least 120 kilometers an hour. Frontal impact will not cause a fire or explosions. Also known as thermal runaway. Greater oversight safety will become a priority for a lot of these homes. They're all talking about it here. I think the problem with the way the self-driving technology features have been solved is it's caused people to think that they could be less attentive to the way the car is actually performing. You still need to monitor the car for putting the onus on battery makers to to make sure such a high impact thermal event won't lead to a fire. For one, is championing advancements in less combustible sodium ion batteries, which Catl says are ready for commercialization, though. Well, this reporter is ready for perhaps just one more spin around the track. Stephen Engle Bloomberg News Check. And we're going to continue the discussion, rather, on Chinese sector in the next hour. We'll have a battery analyst, you and me, from Great Will Securities and also the automobile City founder and CEO Bill Russo, who you just saw in that tape. But Bill Russo joining us as well. You can catch that interview at The Times on your screen. This is Bloomberg. Right. Welcome back. Just before we wrap up the show today, just a glance at markets in Vietnam, some weakness today. We were up as much as 1%, if not more. In the opening minutes, have since clearly pared back and still one of the best performers. In fact, I'd say it's the best performing index over the past five days on political clarity is what we're pointing to at this point in time. Right up on the up still. We're looking at gold. Of course, that's really been a big story. Gold stocks specifically when you look at Indonesia. There we go on your screen some of the big mining related names as gold continues to hit new highs. Just before we wrap up, a quick glance at the Hang Seng index and also some benchmarks to its reminder that we are a day to Christmas and we have some early closures of these markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and also in New Zealand, which is already shots, a truncated sessions there. And since this is our final full broadcast of the year, let me just take the opportunity to wish you all well a happy holiday. Thank you for joining us. Not just today, but for this year so far. We will see you all in full in the new year for the economy. Spend a bit of money for your future self. Maybe don't spend everything, but of course, spend a lot of time, if you can, with your loved ones from us here at the China show. We wish you all well. We'll see you all in the New year.

The announcement came after the US Food and Drug Administration surprisingly rejected Sanofi’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug tolebrutinib. Bloomberg’s Ashleigh Furlong reports.", "content": "00:00\n\nIs this still a surprise for Sanofi? Very much so, because we're seeing this situation obviously where vaccines globally, we were seeing sort of a hit to vaccine sales. Sanofi itself has said at the last quarter that its vaccine sales were down. In the US we have a Health Secretary, Robert F Kennedy, who is almost systematically undermining some of the tenets of vaccines really. But what we have seen is that's mainly targeting childhood vaccinations and this deal is mainly focused on adult immunizations. So I'm assuming that that said, Sanofi is hoping that adult immunizations are protected from those changes that we're seeing in the U.S.. And obviously, you know, this deal will well might take sort of, you know, several years to sort of show show true value for the company. So, you know, we might see changes in the in the rules around vaccines, but in the coming years in the U.S.. Okay. So actually, that's the vaccine story around Sanofi today. Sanofi has also said that the US FDA rejected its drug for multiple sclerosis. What does that setback mean for the French drugmaker? So this is a significant blow. We already in a way expected difficulties with the submission and the FDA had already delayed the to the decision date and we were expecting this potentially come next year. It's surprising this has come so quickly. And and it's also a significant blow potentially to two patients who with a specific type of M.S., which have few options. But for Sanofi, which is really trying to replace its leading drug, DUPIXENT, and that's coming generics are coming in in the next couple of years for that drug. And this this this mass drug was supposed to sort of help it on its way to just sort of replace those revenues. So this rejection in the U.S. is going to be significant for it. And Sanofi seems to hope that, you know, there's a way still a way forward and that it's still discussing with us, with the FDA. But obviously, it is a significant blow. This was the potential for 1.7 billion USD in annual revenue, which would, you know, we the sales will only potentially come from the rest of the world now.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:02 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T09:38:24.937038"}

The UK oil giant will divest a 65% stake, retaining the remaining interest via a joint venture. Bloomberg’s Mitchell Ferman reports.", "content": "00:00\n\nHow big a deal is this, then, for BP and for Stonepeak? Good morning. Yeah, BP reset its strategic direction earlier this year and part of that reset was announcing a $20 billion divestment program. Castrol its lubricants business was the central divestment target for for that program. And the expectations were that this asset could could bring BP as much as 0 billion. And and so, you know, as we as we see today, they sold a majority stake in it for about 6 billion. And obviously, Mitchell, good morning. We know that BP is undergoing this transition period, is getting a new CEO in Meg O'Neill. Does this sale mean that BP can streamline its portfolio as much perhaps, as Elliott wants it to do? Yeah, Good morning. It's you know, it definitely achieves a target that BP set out earlier this year. However, a lot has changed since BP set out that target right there. There is a new chairman. You know, you're talking about Novo Nordisk. There was a bit of a through line with BP. The chairman that departed both BP and Novo this year was Helgoland. And and his replacement at BP is And he is, as you say, he is made quick work with with the CEO change and And so there are still a lot of questions now about about the direction of BP. Yes. And think let's think about those into 2026 then Mitchell. I mean, this is a business that had what mishandled. Is that the way we describe it, a pivot towards renewables. Now it's going to be under a new management team. I mean, is this a sort of back to basics oil business? Is that where we're going? That's what it appears, right? The new chairman said that he wants a simpler, leaner BP. And clearly, And so Meg O'Neill, who starts in April, well, will have to lay out a vision that, you know, could go a number of directions. But the thing that is clear is that it will be an oil and gas vision. And do you think there will be more h.r. Personnel changes under meg o'neill's leadership than if it's going to be a serious pivot, hopefully successful pivot for them this time under her leadership. Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of unanswered questions. Staff internally, as we reported on bloomberg late last week. Staff is is uncertain about about what's happening right now, what's going to happen. They have gone through years of transformations, of strategic pivots, and now they have another another pivot. Murray didn't even have a year or two to kind of carry out his his plan. And now they're going to have a new CEO come in. Most people internally at BP were shocked by this kind of sudden announcement. That shock is probably what investors were were looking for to some degree. But as a result, there are a lot of questions about what's next. And and Meg will have to answer those in due time.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:17:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T09:38:25.220653"}

SHERRY SAID PPR A LITTLE HIGHER, TRADING HIGHER AFTER THE OIL GIANT AGREED TO SELL A MAJORITY STAKE IN ITS LUBRICANTS DIVISION TO THE U.S. INVESTMENT FIRM SANPETE PARTNERS TO RAISE ABOUT $6 BILLION. JOINING US FOR MORE IS A BIG OIL REPORTER MITCHELL FURMAN WHO IS WITH US THIS CHRISTMAS EVE AND HERE TO BREAK DOWN THE STORY. WE HAVE GOT SOME NEWS TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS GOOD I'M PERHAPS WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE A SLOW NEWS DAY. HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS THIS? > > GOOD MORNING. IT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF BP'S 20 BILLION KNOWLEDGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY, STRATEGIC RESET TO MOVE AWAY FROM ITS FAILED LOW CARBON BETS AND BACK TO OIL AND GAS. PART OF THAT WAS DIVESTING $20 MILLION OF ASSETS TO APPROVE THE BALANCE SHEET AND REVERSE YEARS OF UNDERPERFORMANCE IN WHICH THE GAP BETWEEN BP AND ITS COMPETITORS HAS WIDENED. ANNA: DOES THAT MEAN THIS CASTROL SALE, BP CAN STREAMLINE ITS PORTFOLIO? THIS HAS BEEN THE AREA OF FOCUS FROM A PARTICULAR ACTIVIST INVESTOR WHO IS HAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF IMPACT AT BP. > > THIS DOES MAKE SOME HEADWAY IN IN BP'S PORTFOLIO. CASTROL, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN IN BP'S PORTFOLIO THIS CENTURY SINCE IT ACQUIRED IT 25 YEARS AGO, THE ASSET WAS NOT AS FULLY INTEGRATED AS OTHER PARTS OF THE BUSINESS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS BP, WHILE IT IS A MASSIVE OIL AND GAS PRODUCER, IT IS ALSO A MAJOR COMMODITIES TRADER. AND CASTROL WAS NEVER REALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE TRADING BUSINESS LIKE BP'S REFINERIES AND UPSTREAM ASSETS AND PIPELINES WHICH IS TRADERS CAN USE TO OPTIMIZE. CASTROL NEVER REALLY PLAYED IN THAT WAY. SO IT ALLOWS BP TO KIND OF FOCUS ON PARTS OF THE BUSINESS WHERE IT CAN'T OPTIMIZE ITS TRADING ADVANTAGES. ANNA: THAT IS WHY THIS MIGHT BE THE RIGHT ASSET SALE, MITCHELL. WHAT ABOUT OTHER ASSET SALES? THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROGRAM OF SELLING ASSETS TO GET BACK TO BASICS I SUPPOSE FOR THIS OIL BUSINESS. WHAT ARE WE EXPECTED IN 2026 ON THAT FRONT? > > YOUR QUESTIONS ARE AS GOOD AS ANYBODY'S BECAUSE THE NEW CHAIRMAN JUST LAST WEEK ANNOUNCED ABRUPTLY THAT THE CEO WHO ANNOUNCED THE STRATEGIC RESET IN FEBRUARY WILL BE DEPARTING AND MEG O'NEILL WOULD BE COMING IN AS CEO TO REPLACE HIM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MEG O'NEILL WANTS TO DO. WE KNOW CHAIRMAN WANTS BP TO PREPARE BETTER, WHAT'S A SIMPLER, LEANER BP THAT ACCELERATES THIS OIL AND GAS STRATEGY. BUT HOW EXACTLY BP GETS THERE REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND MEG O'NEILL WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS. SHE TAKES OVER APRIL 1. ANNA: MITCHELL, THANK YOU FOR THE BRIEFING. A LOT TO COVER BP IN 2026 NO DOUBT. JOEL FUHRMAN ON THE OIL NARRATIVE THIS MORNING. LET'S TURN TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR. SHARE SUBS TO KNOW IF HE ON THE MOOD THIS MORNING. FROM HER GRAVE TO BUY -- THE FIRM AGREED TO BUY FOR $2.2 BILLION IN A BID TO EXPEND ITS VACCINE PORTFOLIO. THE STOCK IS DOWN .3%. WE ARE JOINED BY ASHLEIGH FURLONG. IS IT SURPRISING THIS BUSINESS THAT SO NO DOING THIS DEAL FOR A VACCINE DEVELOPER RIGHT NOW? TALK US THROUGH THE LOGIC. > > IT IS INTERESTING. AT THE MOMENT WE SEE VACCINE SALES GLOBALLY DOWN. IN THE U.S., VERY SPECIFIC SCENARIO PLAY OUT. WE HAVE A HEALTH SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. THAT IS ALMOST SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINING MANY OF THE TENETS OF VACCINES BRINGING IN QUESTIONS AROUND VACCINE SAFETY. MANY ARE TARGETED AT CHILD HOOD IMMUNIZATIONS. SO POTENTIALLY THERE IS LESS OF A TENSION IN THE ADULT VACCINES BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING TYPE TO BE DOING A VACCINE STEEL GLOBALLY AND SANOFI ITSELF HAS SAID VACCINE SALES ARE NOT DOING AS WELL IS HOPED. ANNA: THAT IS INTERESTING ON THE VACCINE SIDE OF THINGS AND WHY MAKE THIS AT THIS POINT. ELSEWHERE IN THE SANTA FE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY SAID THE U.S. FDA HAS REJECTED ITS DRUG FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. WHAT DOES THAT KIND OF SETBACK MEAN FOR THIS FRENCH PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS? > > IT IS A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK. THE SHARES HAVE NOT REALLY REACTED THAT MUCH AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST BEEN PRICED IN ALREADY. WE SAW EARLIER THIS MONTH THE FDA DELAYED, SAID IT WAS GOING TO DELAY ITS DECISION ON THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DRUG AND ANALYST HAD ANTICIPATED THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A NEGATIVE REACTION. BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR A REALLY TRYING TO REPLACE ITS TOP-SELLING DRUG TO PICK SENT. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF REPLACING AND AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THAT $1.7 BILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE THAT WE HOPED FOR FOR THE DRUG IS UNDER QUESTION AND THEIR QUESTIONS AROUND WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO GET ANY OF THAT REVENUE IN THE COMING YEARS. ANNA: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. HAVE A GOOD BREAK. THE LATEST ON SANOFI. LET'S WIDEN THE LENS. STOCKS AND COMMODITIES HITTING RECORDS DUE TO POLITICAL TENSION AND DATA FROM THE UNITED STATES SHOWING THE ECONOMY EXPANDED AT ITS FASTEST PACE IN TWO YEARS. ALL OF THAT IS VERY MUCH IN THE BACKGROUND FOR ALL ASSET CLASSES RIGHT NOW. LET'S TURN TO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CREDIT MARKETS. JOSH FARBER IS WITH US FROM BNP PARIBAS. NICE TO SPEAK TO YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SPEAK TO US ON 24 DECEMBER NO LESS. WE HAVE A HOST OF THINGS AND PLAY RIGHT NOW. STOCKS ARE DOING REALLY WELL. METALS, COMMODITIES ARE DOING WELL. WHAT KIND OF OPTIMISM TO CREDIT MARKETS GO INTO 2026 WITH? WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK LOOK LIKE TO YOU? > > WE ARE BULLISH ON CREDIT AND WE THINK MOST ASSETS PRICE THAT BULLISHNESS, NOT ALL OF THEM DO, AND WE WANT TO LOOK TO BUY THE ASSETS THAT HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE RALLY. THE PLACE WE START IS HIGH-YIELD SINGLE BE. ANNA: WHY THE HIGH-YIELD? WHY NOT INVESTMENT GRADE? WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE HIGH-YIELD SPACE YOU THINK IS WORTH THE RISK AND PAYING YOU THE REWARD YOU NEED? > > GREAT QUESTION. THE FIRST POINT IS THAT THE RISK TO THE DOWNSIDE FROM LOWER GROWTH WE THINK HAS GONE AWAY. WE THINK THE PATH IS TOWARD A WARMER EUROPEAN ECONOMY LED BY GERMAN FISCAL AND HIGH-YIELD, PARTICULARLY EXPOSED TO INCREASING GROWTH. THE OTHER POINT IS HIGH-YIELD IS CHEAP. ESPECIALLY SINGLE B BECAUSE IT WAS UNFAIRLY TAINTED BY THE PRIVATE CREDIT DEFAULTS IN THE U.S. ANNA: INTERESTING. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN THE GERMAN FISCAL PUSH AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE CREDIT SPACE. IN GERMANY, THEY ARE LOADING UP OUR DEFENSE SPENDING AND ALSO DOING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. IS IT IN BOTH AREAS YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS TO PLAY OUT WELL FOR CREDIT OR MORE THE MOOD MUSIC AROUND THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING MORE AND THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT INTO THE GERMAN ECONOMY? > > IT IS THE -- FIRST OF ALL, IT IS THE POINT OF THE AGGREGATE GROWTH PICTURE IS STRONGER. IN HIGH-YIELD, WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT IS DO YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK? IT IS HARD TO HAVE DEFAULTS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING FASTER. THE SECOND POINT IS HAVING A GLUT OF BULLETINS, WHICH WERE NOT REALLY USED TO AND EUROPE, MEANS THE ASSETS WHICH COMPETE FOR BUNDS, RELATIVELY FEW ARE AROUND. AND THE SCARCITY POINT WE THINK PEOPLE WILL FLEE RATES AND GOING TO CREDIT. ANNA: WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET? WE SPENT A LOT OF THIS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STRESS IN FRANCE IN PARTICULAR AND SOME CORPORATE'S IN FRANCE CAN BORROW MORE CHEAPLY THAN THE SOVEREIGN FOR EXAMPLE NOW. WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS IN RELATION TO YOUR PREFERENCE FOR HIGH-YIELD IN EUROPE? > > WE THINK THE POINT IS THAT THERE IS ENOUGH GOVERNMENT BOND SUPPLY TO KEEP RATES STEEP AND RELATIVELY HIGH IN EUROS AND THAT IS KIND OF A SWEET SPOT FOR CREDIT WHERE IT IS ENOUGH YIELDS TO ATTRACT INVESTORS IN BUT NOT SO VOLATILE TO SCARE INVESTORS AWAY. ANNA: THE SOVEREIGN SIDE? IS THAT LEFT OTHERS TO DECIDE? > > LISTEN, I'M THE CREDIT GUIDE. I WOULD SAY THE MAIN POINT IS WE ARE QUITE COMFORTABLE ON HOW THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM IS POSITIONED WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT. AND SO THIS CONVERGENCE TREND WE SEE, IF WE HAVE MORE BUND, WE ARE LESS OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT IS QUITE HEALTHY FROM A CREDIT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOVEREIGN RISK IN THE WAY YOU DID 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO. ANNA: CREDIT MARKETS HAVE BEEN ENJOYING A LOT OF ISSUANCE FROM HYPERSCALERS RECENTLY. IS THAT SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING PLAY OUT EVEN MORE IN 2026? > > THAT IS THE KEY THING TO WATCH. IN CASH WHAT WE WANT TO BUY SINGLE B IS HER MAIN ASSET OF CHOICE, THE THING WE WANT TO SELL IS THE LONG END OF AN EUROS AND DOLLARS. WE ARE NOT USED TO THE LEVEL OF DURATION, LEVEL OF SUPPLY WE ARE GOING TO SEE FROM THESE HIGH QUALITY HYPERSCALERS. SO THAT IS BASICALLY THE COMPRESSION TRADE IS ON THE ONE HAND, HIGH RISK ASSETS ARE UNDERSUPPLIED AND LOW RISK ASSETS ARE VERY HEAVILY SUPPLIED . WE THINK SOMETHING LIKE 10% OF THE TOTAL HYPERSCALE DEBT ISSUANCE IS GOING TO COME TO EUROS. BUT 10% OF THE AMERICAN MARKET WHEN THE DOLLAR MARKET IS THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF THE EURO MARKET AND ABOUT 2.5 TIMES DURATION, IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. ANNA: WHETHER IN DOLLARS OR EUROS, NOT PAYING YOU ENOUGH CASH NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH? > > IT IS NOT THE ISSUER'S THEMSELVES, IT IS MORE THE DURATION BUCKET OF THE EXISTING BONDS WILL NEED TO REPRICE FROM EVERY COMPANY THAT ISSUES AT THE LONG AND IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH THE SUPPLY COMING. ANNA: THAT IS WHAT IT DOES TO THE REST OF THE MARKET. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT WHETHER STOCKS ARE OVERVALUED IN THE HYPERSCALER SPACE FOR EXAMPLE. ONE THING THEY CHOSE TO WATCH AS DEBT LEVELS. THEY SAY IT IS DIFFERENT TO THE LATE 1990'S BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT VERY INDEBTED COMPANIES. YOUR CAUTION RALLIES HYPERSCALERS IS NOT TO DO WITH IN WORRIED ABOUT DEBT SUSTAINABILITY, IT IS MORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH REWARD FOR TAKING ON THE DEBT. > > IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL POSITION WE THINK THAT PART OF THE REASON WHY THE DEBT IS COMING IS BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO IT, BUT THE POINT FROM THE INVESTOR PERSPECTIVE IS THE TECHNICAL AROUND THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THERE IS SO MUCH SUPPLIED THAT IT WILL BE PRICED IN THE MARKET. ANNA: THERE AREAS YOU DO WORRY ABOUT, TO FASTER GROWTH RATE OF DEBT FOR SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES ON THE AI BUILD OUT, THE DATA CENTER BUILDOUT? ARE THERE ANY ALARM BELLS GOING OFF RIGHT NOW? > > WE DON'T HAVE ALARM BELLS. OBVIOUSLY, NEED TO LOOK AT THE CREDITS CASE-BY-CASE. BUT ON THE WHOLE, WE THINK CREDIT IS STILL IN A FAIRLY SWEET SPOT WHERE THERE IS ENOUGH SUPPLY IN DOLLARS FOR THE BOND SCARCITY BUT NOT SO MUCH AS TO DROWN US. ANNA: WE TALKED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM ABOUT M & A STORIES, BP SELLING ONE ASSET, SANOFI BUYING ANOTHER ASSET. IF M & A COMES BACK IS A BIG THEME IN 2026 -- IT IS ARGUABLY HERE ALREADY AND INVESTMENT BANKERS HAVE BEEN TELLING US IT WAS COMING FOR A WHILE. PRIVATE EQUITY MAY BE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING AS WELL. IF WE SEE MUCH MORE M & A, IS THAT GOING TO MEAN A LOT MORE CREDIT ISSUANCE? IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL PLAY INTO YOUR SPACE? > > THAT PLACE AND OUR FORECAST BUT LARGELY A DOLLAR STORY. THE ANIMAL SPIRITS ARE MUCH STRONGER IN THE U.S. IN EUROPE, WE SAY IT IS MORE LIKE A PLANT. THE PACE OF M & A WE EXPECT IN EUROPE IS MATERIALLY SLOWER. AND THAT REFLECTS JUST A DIFFERENT ECONOMY AND DIFFERENT SECTOR MIX. ANNA: THE M & A STORY WILL BE STATESIDE YOU THINK? A LOT OF PRIVATE EQUITY NAMES AND EUROPE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME FOR M & A TICKET IN SO THEY CAN TRY AND GET SOME OF THEIR MONEY BACK. > > WE THINK IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL YOU A STORY, YES. ANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, JOSH FARBER, HEAD OF EUROPEAN CREDIT STRATEGY AT BNP PARIBAS. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS REIGNITED TENSIONS OVER GREENLAND THIS WEEK AS HE APPOINTED HIS FIRST EVER OR THE FIRST EVER U.S. ENVOY TO GREENLAND. WE WILL DISCUSS WITH ROBERTA HAAR OF MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: WELCOME BACK. THIS IS \"THE PULSE.\" LIVE FROM LONDON. PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SAYS UKRAINE AND THE UNITED STATES REMAIN SPLIT PRIMARILY ON TERRITORIAL ISSUES IN TALKS ON A PEACE PLAN TO END RUSSIA'S WAR. WEEKS OF U.S. BROKERED TALKS HAVE PRODUCED 20 POINT PEACE PLAN THAT COULD BECOME THE BASIS FOR ENDING EUROPE'S WORST CONFLICT SINCE WORLD WAR II. THE UKRAINIAN LEADER EMPHASIZED THE DRAFT LARGELY REFLECTS THE JOINT UKRAINIAN AMERICAN POSITION AND SOME POINTS STILL NEED TO BE FINALIZED. MEANWHILE, RUSSIAN CONTINUES TO TARGET UKRAINE'S POWER SUPPLY WITH MISSILES AND DRONES AT A TIME OF YEAR WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND FREEZING. THE CEO OF UKRAINE'S BIGGEST PRIVATE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT, TOLD BLOOMBERG THIS IS GOING TO BE THE HARDEST WINTER YET. > > UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE UNDER MASSIVE ATTACKS OF RUSSIANS AND THE MAJOR TARGET ATTACK IS POWER STATIONS. AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE BEING ATTACKED ON A PER STATION MORE THAN SIX TIMES SINCE SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR. I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE HARDEST WINTER SINCE A FULL-SCALE INVASION. ANNA: MEANWHILE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS IMPOSED VISA SANCTIONS ON FORMER EU COMMISSIONER AND FOUR OTHER PEOPLE FOR TRYING TO MAKE AMERICAN TECH COMPANIES POLICE POLITICAL SPEECH. IN A POST ON X, RESPONDED THE EUROPEAN WAR WAS VOTED IN WITH BROAD-BASED SUPPORT WRITING \"TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS, CENSORSHIP IS IT WHERE YOU THINK IT IS.\" THE STATE DEPARTMENT TARGETED ACTIVISTS AND NONPROFITS FOCUSED ON DIGITAL HATE SPEECH. LET'S DISCUSS THE BROAD DEFENSE AND DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS WITH ROBERTA HAAR, PROFESSOR OF FOREIGN POLICY AT MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY. PROFESSOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET'S START WITH THE BROAD STATE OF AFFAIRS TRANSATLANTIC LATE. WE RECENTLY HEARD FROM THE UNITED STATES CODIFYING THEIR SECURITY STRATEGY UNDER THIS NEW NATIONAL SECURITY DOCUMENT. I WONDER WHERE THAT LEAVES THE STATE OF RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC? > > THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. YES, AT THE MOMENT, RELATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY BUMPY. CERTAINLY, THE DOCUMENT THAT JUST CAME OUT REALLY WOULD PUSH, SHE MENTIONED BEFORE, THE FAR RIGHT OR THOSE THAT ARE ALIGNING MOST OF THE MAGA IDEAS WITHIN EUROPE, AND THIS WOULD SEEM TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT ALSO WITH JD VANCE THAT THE DIGITAL GOVERNANCE IS A PROBLEM, AS YOU SAID, RATON IS THINKING ABOUT THE EU FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS. SORRY, I'M GETTING RATHER NERVOUS. ANNA: THAT'S OK. LET ME ASK A QUESTION ON THAT MIGHT HELP US TO FOCUS THE CONVERSATION A LITTLE MORE. HOW DO YOU THINK EUROPE SHOULD RESPOND? THE UNITED STATES HAS PLACED SANCTIONS ON PEOPLE LIKE TERRY RATON, WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT SUGGESTS THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETING FREE SPEECH. HOW SHOULD EUROPE TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT SANCTIONING OF THOSE KINDS OF INDIVIDUALS? > > I THINK ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING THIS FLATTERING PLOY AND RESPONDING -- I THINK EUROPEANS SHOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO COME THEY SHOULD FIRMLY RESIST THIS PRESSURE TO SAFEGUARD, SHOULD TRY TO SAFEGUARD THE REGULATORY AUTONOMY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGIES WE HAD I WAS WITH A POLICY BRIEF AND WE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE CLEAR INTERNAL POSITIONS, SHOULD RESIST THE TIPS TO DILUTE OR REINTERPRET THEIR DIGITAL MARKETS, DIGITAL SERVICE ACT, AI ACT AND SHOULD TRY TO HOLD IT AS A REGULATORY LEADER. I THINK THEY SHOULD RESIST TRYING TO TRADE AWAY THEIR DIGITAL STANDARDS AND NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING TRADE, TARIFFS, SECURITY COOPERATION. I THINK THEY SHOULD TRY TO SHIELD THEIR EU DECISION-MAKING FROM THEIR COERCIVE BARGAINING TACTICS COMING OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. ANNA: ROBERTA, WHY DO YOU THINK EUROPE APPEARS SO CONSTRAINED WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? CLEARLY, WITH UNITED STATES PROVIDING THE SECURITY BACKDROP OVER DECADES, THAT HAS BECOME TOO COMFORTABLE POSITION PERHAPS FOR EUROPE, CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE THE VIEW OF THE AMERICANS. SO MAYBE THAT LIMITS EUROPE'S ABILITY TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. > > EUROPE DEFINITELY HAS HISTORY OF FRAGMENTATION. HISTORY OF THINKING OF SOVEREIGNTY MINDSETS. THEY ALSO HAVE MANY VULNERABILITIES. BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO INTENSIFY THEIR MILITARY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES SO THEY ARE DOING THAT. I'M SURE YOU HAVE DISCUSSED ALREADY THE LONDON-BASED II SS STUDIES HAS TALKED ABOUT THE THREAT FOR THE RUSSIA COMING AS EARLY AS 2027. IT COULD TAKE AS MUCH AS $1 TRILLION TO BRING UP THEIR NON-NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES ON A LEVEL THAT THE U.S. IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING. THEY ARE DOING THAT BUT I THINK THIS FRAGMENTATION IN PROCUREMENT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE JOINT PROCUREMENT, LESS WEAPONS SYSTEMS COMPARED TO THE PAST. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THEY NEED TO DO TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR DEFENSE PROCUREMENT AND POSTURE. ANNA: WITH ALL THAT SAID, ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A FLAREUP IN TENSIONS BE AROUND GREENLAND AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY. THE STORY SORT OF LINGERS. HOW SHOULD EUROPE RESPOND ON THIS KIND OF FRONT? PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING -- WELL, POINTING SOMEBODY TO BE ALMOST LIKE AN AMBASSADOR TO GREENLAND AND MAKING CLEAR THERE IS STILL AN INTENTION TO TRY AND MAKE THAT AMERICAN? > > CERTAINLY TRUMP HAS PAID TO PLAY FOREIGN POLICY I TALKED ABOUT WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SORT OF BASED ON MORE OF AN OVERSEAS PRESSURE. LOTS OF CORRUPTION SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. I GUESS GREENLAND WOULD FALL INTO THAT. THERE WAS A RECENT ARTICLE THAT IS PART OF A GOAL TO HAVE EUROPE AS A NEOCOLONIAL OUTLOOK ON HOW TO DEAL WITH EUROPE, THE WINNERS IN THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. SO LIKES THIS TOUGH GUY AND EUROPE WOULD BE SORT OF THE DEBTS REPLACED BY THE ALPHA MALES OF THE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT. ANNA: AND PART OF THAT ANALYSIS, DOES THAT INCLUDE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA -- WHICH HAS BEEN TRULY RESHAPED I SUPPOSE UNDER THIS TRUMP PRESIDENCY? > > I THINK TRUMP HAS A FONDNESS FOR RUSSIA OR IDEA THAT HE WANTS TO DEAL IN A TRANSACTIONAL WAY OR INVESTMENT WAY WITH RUSSIA SINCE HIS FIRST ADMINISTRATION. IN AN ARTICLE IN 2021, CERTAINLY THAT IS CONSISTENT OF HIS VIEW OR EVEN BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT THAT HE HAD THIS VERY POSITIVE VIEW TOWARD PUTIN AND TOWARD RUSSIA AND NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE INVESTMENT POSSIBILITIES WITH RUSSIA. CERTAINLY, HE LIKES TOUGH GUYS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW TRUMP DID WITH POLITICO, HE ALSO CALLED EUROPEAN LEADERS WEAK BUT HE WAS VERY POSITIVE ABOUT ERODGAN OF TURKEY. HE CALLED HIM A TOUGH COOKIE. IN ONE WAY EUROPE CAN RESPOND TO TRUMP IS NOT LETTING HIM BULLY THEM BUT TO DO WHAT MARK CARNEY DID OR ERDOGAN OR EVEN WHAT SUSIE WILES TALKS ABOUT IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, STAND UP TO HIM OR THE NOT SO FLATTERING BUT MORE RESILIENT AND MORE TOUGH. ANNA: ROBERTA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY, ROBERTA HAAR. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, A BUSY YEAR IN THE COURTS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HIS ADMINISTRATION LOSES A CASE AT THE SUPREME COURT THAT IS ANOTHER RULING UPHELD BY FEDERAL JUDGE. ALL OF THAT JUST YESTERDAY. WE BREAK DOWN ALL OF THIS WITH A LAW PROFESSOR SHORTLY. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME BACK TO \"THE PULSE.\" THESE ARE YOUR TOP STORIES. THE CENTER REALLY MARCHES ON. THE S & P HITS A RECORD AND GOLD BREAKS THROUGH $4500 FOR THE FIRST TIME. MARKETS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POND CLOSE EARLY TODAY. BLOWOUT GDP IN THE USA, AMERICAN GROWTH CRUSHES ESTIMATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER WITH ITS FASTEST READING IN TWO YEARS. AND A SETBACK FOR BIG TECH AND SKILLED FOREIGN WORKERS. A FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN MOVE AHEAD WITH A $100,000 FEE ON APPLICATIONS FOR NEW H-1B VISAS. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN IT COMES TO SETTING POLICY AND EXPANDING THE LIMITS OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER. IT CERTAINLY TESTING THEM WITH HIS TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENTS IN PARTICULAR, SENDING SHOCKWAVES AROUND THE WORLD. BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS CHIEF ECONOMIST LOOKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE TRADE POLICY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR INFLATION AND THE U.S. CONSUMER. > > CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE, PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A BIG BET THE U.S. HAD A MAGNETIC APPEAL. AND THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO GET A BETTER DEAL FROM U.S. TRADE PARTNERS AND COMPANIES THAT WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. ON THE EVIDENCE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS, THAT IS PLAYING OUT PRETTY NICELY. ECONOMISTS DON'T AGREE ON MUCH. ONE THING THEY DO AGREE ON IS THAT FREE TRADE IS GOOD AND THAT TARIFFS ARE BAD. TRUMP ESCALATED U.S. TARIFFS ON CHINA ALL THE WAY TO 125%. IF YOU PLUGGED THE U.S. TARIFFS INTO A MODEL OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WHAT IT SAID WAS THERE WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT DRAG ON GROWTH AND THERE WAS ALSO GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT UPWARD IMPULSE TO PRICES. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO INFLATION OVER THE SUMMER, IT HAS NOT COME DOWN BUT IT HAS NOT COME UP EITHER. WHY IS THAT? IT IS BECAUSE U.S. IMPORTERS AND FOREIGN EXPORTERS SAW THE TRUMP TARIFFS COMING AND THEY RUSHED TO FRONT LOAD, SHIPPING TO THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE TARIFFS COULD COME INTO FORCE. ONE THING THAT IS HAPPEN IS WE HAVE GONE FROM A LOT OF UNEXPECTED BAD NEWS CONCENTRATED ON A SINGLE DAY TO A SERIES OF COUNTRY BY COUNTRY DEALS, SOMETHING OF A SWISS CHEESE OF EXEMPTIONS AND CARVEOUTS. THE TRADE WAR IS A DRAG BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING WHICH IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE GOT TAX CUTS WITH TRUMP 'S ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL AND A BONFIRE OF REGULATIONS WHICH IS STOKING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS OF U.S. BUSINESSES. WE ALSO HAVE GOT THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT GOING INTO DATA CENTERS. TARIFFS ARE HAVING AN EFFECT. CHINA'S EXPORTS TO THE U.S. ARE WAY DOWN RELATIVE TO THE HISTORICAL TREND. SO WHO PAYS FOR THE COST OF TARIFFS? DESPITE HIS WELL-KNOWN LOVE OF GOLD, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT AN ALCHEMIST. HE CAN'T MAKE SOMETHING FROM NOTHING. THAT MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE READ ALL OF THE EVIDENCE SO FAR SUGGESTS THAT IN THE END, THE BULK OF IT IS GOING TO COME FROM U.S. BUSINESSES AND U.S. HOUSEHOLDS. ANNA: REPORTING ON WHITE HOUSE TRADE POLICY AND THE IMPACT IT HAS AND HAS NOT HAD ON THE U.S. ECONOMY. LET'S PIVOT FROM THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS TO THE LEGAL SIDE. A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED THAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN GO AHEAD WITH IMPOSING A $100,000 FEE ON NEW H-1B VISAS APPLICATIONS. IT IS A SETBACK FOR U.S. TECH COMPANIES PERHAPS THAT RELY ON HIRING SKILL FOREIGN WORKERS. THE JUDGE SAID THE MOVE WAS LAWFUL BUT THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WHICH SUED TO BLOCK THE PROPOSAL, CAN APPEAL. MEANWHILE, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS REFUSED TO LET PRESIDENT TRUMP DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN CHICAGO. A MAJORITY OF JUDGES RULED THE ADMINISTRATION FAILED TO IDENTIFY A SOURCE OF AUTHORITY THAT WOULD ALLOW THE MILITARY TO EXECUTE THE LAWS. AT THE MOVE IS A SETBACK FOR TRUMP'S BRIBED TO USE OF MILITARY IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LET'S PUT THIS TOGETHER AS THE YEAR COMES TO A CLOSE AND ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE JOINED NOW TO DISCUSS THE SUPREME COURT IN PARTICULAR BY ILARIA DI GIOIA WHO IS WITH US TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL SIDE, LAW PROFESSOR AT BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. WE HAVE GONE TO A COUPLE OF STORIES HOW IN SOME CASES PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WINNING OUT AND THE EXECUTIVE IS GETTING ITS WAY IN WHAT IT WANTS AND IN OTHER WAYS THE LAW, THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS PUSHING BACK AGAINST HIM. HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE 2025 AND THE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE SEEN BETWEEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE EXECUTIVE? > > 2025 HAS BEEN A VERY DISTINCT YEAR FOR A LAW PROFESSOR TO WATCH AND I THINK FOR EVERYONE. IF WE PUT IT IN A FRAME COME THE SUPREME COURT IS A CONSERVATIVE COURT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS APPOINTED THREE OF ITS MEMBERS. ACTUALLY, WHAT WE EXPECTED WAS THE SUPREME COURT TO BE INCREASINGLY FAVORING PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS HAS BEEN EVIDENT IN MANY CASES. YOU JUST MENTIONED THE TARIFFS. THE CASE WAS DISCUSSED IN NOVEMBER, THE HEARING WAS IN NOVEMBER AT THE SUPREME COURT. WE DON'T KNOW YET THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE BUT WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUSHING THE JUDGES TO RULE IN HIS FAVOR AND IS DOING THIS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, DOING PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE ON JUDGES THAT ARE HIS NOMINEES. THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AMERICAN SYSTEM, OF THE AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE JUDGES ARE NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT. SO IT IS SOMEHOW POLITICIZED IS A COURT THAT IS VERY EXPLICITLY POLITICIZED. AND IT IS A COURT THAT IS IDEOLOGICAL. SO CONSERVATIVE JUDGES HAVE CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGY. ANNA: THIS YEAR, HAVE WE SEEN THE SUPREME COURT ACT IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP MORE THAN WE MIGHT HAVE DONE UNDER PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT'S WHEN THEY WERE NOT -- THEY DO NOT REPRESENT QUITE SO MANY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPOINTMENTS? > > WELL, IF WE PUT EVERYTHING ON THE SCALE, WE CAN SEE THE TREND ALREADY STARTED DURING THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. MANY WERE TAKEN BY THE SAME JUSTICES. THE TREND IS ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO THE FIRST TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND THE SORT OF SLOWLY INCREASING -- I WOULD NOT SAY THIS IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW OR UNEXPECTED. THIS IS JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FIRST TRUMP PRESIDENCY, OF THE NOMINATION OF THE JUSTICES. AS I SAID, WE ALREADY SEE THE TREND UNDER BIDEN AND THIS EXPANSION OF EXECUTIVE POWER THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT IS VERY, VERY EVIDENT STARTED ALREADY UNDER THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. ANNA: GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MUCH -- OK, SO UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW MUCH OF A STEP UP WE ARE SEEING IN THIS USE OF UNILATERAL EXECUTIVE ACTION. > > WELL, THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE IS A THEORY CALLED THE EXECUTIVE THEORY THAT SAYS THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE ALL THE POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND IT MEANS THE POWER THAT CONGRESS DELEGATES TO THE PRESIDENT'S POWER THE PRESIDENT CAN HOLD UNILATERALLY. NOW, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY -- NOT ONLY IN THE COURT BUT IN FACT, THE CONGRESS OF SLOWLY DELEGATING AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO TARIFFS. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ARGUING THE CONGRESS HAS GIVEN HIM THE POWER TO IMPOSE TARIFFS AND THIS IS, AS I SAID, A SLOW PROCESS THAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE FOR ONE MAIN REASON -- NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COURT, IT IS BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS GIVEN UP ITS CONFIDENCE TO THE PRESIDENT. THE POLARIZATION THAT HAVING AN CONGRESS FROM THE GRIDLOCK, THIS INCREASING DIFFICULTY IN COMING TO A DECISION MEANS THE PRESIDENT HAS THE UPPER HAND. DELEGATION OF POWER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY CONGRESS AND IS NOW UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE SUPREME COURT. ANNA: IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THEN THE SUPREME COURT WILL AGREE WITH THAT VIEW, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VIEW AND SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO ON THESE IEEPA TARIFFS? IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT WILL HAPPEN OR WE SAW QUITE A LOT OF REPORTING THAT SUGGESTED THE EARLY COMMENTARY COMING FROM THE SUPREME COURT WOULD PUSH AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. > > INDEED. DURING THE HEARING, THE JUDGES -- THE JUSTICES WERE PUSHING AND WERE PUSHING AGAINST THE FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR TRUMP. HIS NOMINEES WERE PUSHING AGAINST HIM. BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DECISIONS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE ON PAPER. IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THE DECISION TO ARISE. AND THERE HAVE BEEN OF COURSE AMICUS BRIEFS PUSHING AGAINST -- THE FACT REMAINS THE COURT IS A CONSERVATIVE COURT. IF WE DON'T SEE A DECISION IN FAVOR OF TRUMP, WE WILL SEE A DECISION MAY BE OF THOSE NEUTRAL DECISIONS THE SUPREME COURT ABSTAINING FROM DECIDING RATED THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER OPTION. SO I DON'T SEE THE SUPREME COURT TO BE COMPLETELY IN FAVOR OF TRUMP BEING ABLE TO IMPOSE TARIFFS BECAUSE IT IS A VERY NARROW LEGAL ISSUE THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON. IT IS QUITE PROBLEMATIC. BUT SEE THE SUPREME COURT USING HIS VERY INTERESTING LEGAL WEAPONS TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL. ANNA: SO I HADN'T REALIZED THEY COULD ABSTAIN. AT IS INTERESTING. WHEN WE EXPECT -- SOME EXPECTED WE MIGHT GET A DECISION THIS WEEK. LOOKING LESS LIKELY I SUPPOSE. > > THE CASE IS NOT A NORMAL CASE. IT IS ONE OF THOSE EXPEDITED DECISIONS. USUALLY CASES ARE DECIDED IN JUNE BUT I WOULD EXPECT THE CASE TO BE DECIDED A BIT EARLIER PERHAPS JANUARY OR FEBRUARY BECAUSE IT WILL NEED AN EXPEDITED DECISION. ANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, ILARIA DI GIOIA, LAW PROFESSOR AT BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY WITH THAT BRIEFING ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE EXECUTIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE ARE WATCHING OIL PRICES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THIS MORNING. NEARLY HALF A DOZEN TANKERS LADEN WITH CRUDE HAVE DEPARTED FROM VENEZUELA'S COAST DESPITE INCREASED PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES. DATA SHOWS MOST OF THE TANKERS ARE HEADED TO WASHINGTON AND AT LEAST HALF OF THEM ARE CHARTERED BY CHEVRON AS A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INTENSIFIES EFFORTS TO CURB OIL REVENUE BY TARGETING SANCTIONED VESSELS. THE VENEZUELAN DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST AND NOBEL LAUREATE TOLD BLOOMBERG IN OCTOBER THE U.S. PRESSURE ON CARACAS SHOULD FORCE PRESIDENT MADURO TO BEGIN A TRANSFER OF POWER. > > I BELIEVE THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE AND THE ESCALATION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IS THE ONLY WAY TO FORCE MADURO THAT IT IS TIME TO GO. AND THOSE THAT STILL SUPPORT HIM , WHICH ARE VERY FEW AT THIS POINT, THE TOP BRASS OF THE MILITARY, FINANCIAL ENABLERS, FRONT MEN THAT ARE MAKING HUGE ABSTAIN FORTUNES -- I'VE SEEN FORTUNES, BETTER UNDERSTAND TIME IS RUNNING OUT. I BELIEVE THIS ESCALATION IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE THAT STILL SUPPORT MADURO TO UNDERSTAND THEY NEED TO TAKE ALL SUPPORT AWAY FROM HIM AND MADURO HIMSELF TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE TO TRULY FACILITATE A PEACEFUL AND ORDER OF TRANSITION, WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT. ANNA: LIBYA'S MILITARY CHIEF OF STAFF HAS BEEN KILLED ALONGSIDE SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE IN A PLANE CRASH IN TURKEY. HE HAD BEEN RETURNING TO TRIPOLI FROM ANKARA WHEN THE PLANE REPORTED AN ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF. FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN THE MANAGING EDITOR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THIS CRASH? > > THE JET CARRYING THE LIBYAN DELEGATION CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER ITS TAKEOFF AT ABOUT 8:00 P.M. IN ANKARA THE PLANE NOTIFIED THE AIR CONTROL IT WAS SUFFERING FROM ELECTRICAL PROBLEM AND ASKED FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING BACK WHERE IT HAD TAKEN OFF FROM. PREPARATIONS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THE LANDING WHEN RADIO CONTACT WITH THE PLANE WAS LOST. ITS WRECKAGE WAS LATER FOUND IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL WITH ALL ON BOARD FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT PEOPLE INCLUDING CRUDE MEMBERS -- CREWMEMBERS, WERE KILLED. THE LIBYAN MILITARY DELEGATION WAS HEADED BY MOHAMMED ALI AHMED AL-HADDAD. HE WAS A WELL-RESPECTED FIGURE BACK IN TRIPOLI AND A KEY FIGURE IN U.N. BACK TALKS IN UNIFYING THE TWO RIVAL GOVERNMENTS IN LIBYA WHERE THE TWO ADMINISTRATIONS. ANNA: WITH THAT BACKDROP IN MIND, WHY WAS THE DELEGATION VISITING TURKEY? > > HE WAS IN ANKARA FOR DEFENSE TALKS. HIS ADMINISTRATION IN TRIPOLI HAS BEEN BACKED THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND THAT BACKING WAS MOST PRONOUNCED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO WHEN A PREDECESSOR TO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION TRIPOLI WAS UNDER ASSAULT BY FORCES IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY AND HAS SAVED ADMINISTRATION FROM COLLAPSING. SINCE THEN, ANOTHER GOVERNMENT IN THE WEST THAT HE BELONGED TO HAD BEEN OPERATING MILITARY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING PRODUCT DRONES. ONE IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN THIS REGION. THEY BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY AND WIDELY IN CONFLICTS FROM LIBYA ALDWYCH OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE WHERE THERE WAS A WAR BACK IN 2020. THE DEFENSE CORPORATION WAS THE MAIN ITEM THAT THE DELEGATION HAD COME TO ANKARA TO DISCUSS BEFORE THEY TRIED TO FLY BACK TO TRIPOLI BEFORE THE JET CRASHED. ANNA: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM COME IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL SYMBOL HAS APPROVED A STOPGAP BUDGET LAW FOR NEXT YEAR. WE WILL BRING YOU THE LATEST NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" ♪ ANNA: THE CONVERSATIONS THAT MATTER AND THE INSIGHTS YOU NEED, THIS IS \"THE PULSE.\" THE FRENCH NATIONAL SYMBOL HAS APPROVED A STOPGAP BUDGET LAW FOR NEXT YEAR AFTER FAILING TO AGREE ON THE FULL FISCAL PLAN. THE SO-CALLED SPECIAL LAW EFFECTIVELY ROLLS OVER 2025 FISCAL PLANS INTO THE NEW YEAR, ALLOWING THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT TAXES AND BORROW MONEY. FOR MORE, LET'S GET TO OUR ECONOMIST AT BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS WHO JOINS US NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE FRENCH ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. WE STILL DON'T HAVE A FULL BUDGET FOR 2026, BUT ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD A FULL BUDGET? WHERE ARE THE STICKING POINTS NOW? > > THE POLITICAL SITUATION REMAINS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX. PARLIAMENT IS DEEPLY FRAGMENTED BETWEEN THE CONSERVATIVE SENATE AND THE LEFT-LEANING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. ON TOP OF THAT, POLITICAL PARTIES ARE UNWILLING TO COMPROMISE AND ARE LOOKING TO BRING HOME SOME MAJOR CONCESSIONS FROM THE GOVERNMENT LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER TAXATION ON WEALTH. UNDER BUDGET ITSELF, WE THINK A COMPROMISE IS ENRICHED AS SOME 10 BILLION EUROS OF TAX HIKES OR EXPENDITURE CUTS ARE MISSING TO ENRICH THE 5% DEFICIT CARD TO GET FOR 2026 -- TARGET FOR 2026. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE POLITICAL RISK PREMIUM IN THE MARKET IS FAILING. IF YOU LOOK AT GERMANY, IT IS BACK TO ITS AUGUST WHICH I GUESS IS QUITE A GOOD SIGN FOR THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. ANNA: YES, INDEED, THE SPREAD IN FOCUS. YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT HOW FRANCE CAN RAISE THE MONEY THAT IT NEEDS. PERHAPS SAVING BILLIONS BY BORROWING SHORT-TERM DEBT. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF GOVERNMENTS BRING FOCUS ON THE SHORT-TERM DEBT RAISING AS OPPOSED TO THE LONG END OF THE CURVE. WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THIS ANALYSIS? > > JUST TO TAKE A STEP BACK, FRANCE NEEDS TO FIND MORE THAN 100 BILLION EUROS OF SAVINGS OVER FOUR YEARS JUST TO REACH ITS COMMITMENT OF BRINGING THE BACK TO THREE PERCENT OF GDP IN 2029. TO DO THAT, MAJOR SPENDING CUTS AND PENSION REFORM AS WELL AS TAX INCREASES REMAIN CRUCIAL TO KEEP THE DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL. IN THIS CONTEXT WE CAN LOOK AT ANOTHER WAY TO SAVE MONEY AND THAT IS WHY WE LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF ISSUING SHORTER BONDS TO REDUCE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THIS WOULD BRING SOME HELP TO REDUCING INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER TIME. IT WOULD BE -- THE GAINS WOULD BE BIGGER IF THE ECB WERE TO BE A BIT MORE DOVISH. STILL, IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL. IT WOULD COME AT A HIGH COST. SOMETHING THAT LEADS US TO SAY IT WILL BE A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RISK AND SAVING MONEY. ANNA: THE ROLLOVER RISK COULD THROW UP ISSUES INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JEAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. THE ECONOMIC DATA ONCE AGAIN LEAVING INVESTORS SPLIT ON WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR MONETARY POLICY. ON ONE HAND, THE UNITED STATES, U.S. ECONOMY EXPANDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AT THE FASTEST PACE IN TWO YEARS, BOLSTERED BY RESILIENT SPENDING. ON THE OTHER HAND, A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE TOPLINE GDP DATA. THERE TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL, ARE STRATEGISTS VEN RAM. YOU HAVE DONE SOME DIGGING INTO THEIR PRINT. THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS WAS A BLOWOUT NUMBER ON GDP OUT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DEEP DIVES YET THAT REVEAL ANY SKEPTICISM. WHAT HAVE YOU UNCOVERED? > > GOOD MORNING. I THINK THE BROAD PERSPECTIVE IS YOU COULD QUIBBLE ABOUT THE ACTUAL GROWTH NUMBER BUT THE BIG PERSPECTIVE, BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE IS THE ECONOMY IS GROWING -- SEEMS TO BE FIGHTING ON ALL CYLINDERS. THAT IS A BIG TAKEAWAY. YOU'VE GOT 4.3% GROWTH EVEN ABOUT 3% FROM A 4% THEREABOUTS. I THINK U.S. ECONOMY IS DOING PRETTY WELL. THE FED EXPECTS -- THE FED HAS BOOSTED ITS OWN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH THE ECONOMY WILL GROW NEXT YEAR TO 2.3%, WELL ABOVE TREND GROWTH. HERE IS AN ECONOMY DOING PRETTY WELL. IF YOU JUXTAPOSE THAT WITH 2.8 PERCENT ON AVERAGE THIS YEAR, IT RAISES A VERY DISTURBING QUESTION. SHOULD THE FED BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES AT ALL IN THIS KIND OF SCENARIO? WHICH PART OF THE ECONOMY NEEDS RATE CUTS? IF WHERE INFLATION ISN'T AT TARGET YET, WHY ARE THEY RUSHING TO CUT RATES? THAT IS A BIG QUESTION FOR THE MARKETS TO WRESTLE WITH NEXT YEAR. ANNA: OK, AND ANOTHER QUESTION, WHETHER WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON METALS, PRECIOUS METALS IN PARTICULAR? CAN THE RALLY CONTINUE IN PRECIOUS METALS? > > IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE. IT CERTAINLY GOT MOMENTUM. THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL SEEM TO BE BUYING GOLD. SILVER IS LEADING WITH GOLD HIGHER IN PARTICULAR LIKE OF THE CYCLE. THE SUPPLY SQUEEZE CONTINUES, I THINK SILVER WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD GOLD HIGHER. MARKETS HAVE CAUGHT UNDER THIS PROPHECY THAT IT IS GOING TO GO TO $5,000 AN OUNCE. SO EVERYONE IN GOLD, EVERYONE'S CROSS HAIRS. TO AN EXTENT, THIS IS A BIT OF A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY FOR THE MARKETS. EVERYONE IN THE MARKETS EXPECTS THAT LEVEL TO BE CROSSED AND THEREFORE IT DOES LOOK LIKE WE MAY GET TO THAT LEVEL. BUT THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES A RISK-REWARD BEYOND THAT? GOLD CAN'T KEEP RISING. IT HAS RISEN 70% THIS YEAR. THAT IS THE SECOND BEST ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SINCE 1979. THE IRONY IS IF YOU BOUGHT AT THE PEAK IN 1979, IT TOOK YOU YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE YOU BROKE EVEN. I THINK INVESTORS NEED TO PAY SOME CAUTION TO HOW MUCH THEY ARE PAYING TO GET -- GOLD. ANNA: KEEP THAT FACT IN MIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO GET IN TO THIS TRADE. LOOKING AT CENTRAL BANKS IN 2026, ARE WE LOOKING AT A FULL RANGE OF HAWKS, DOVES, NEUTRAL, EVERYTHING IN THE MIX IN TERMS OF CENTRAL BANKING? > > WELL, I THINK AT LEAST A FEW THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE GOING TO BE HAWKISH. THE BANK OF AUSTRALIA AND BANK OF NEW ZEALAND ARE ALREADY SHOWING INCLINATION THEY'RE GOING TO BE A BIT HAWKISH. GET THE ECB THAT IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE NEUTRAL BECAUSE INFLATION IS A TARGET. IT IS PROBABLY THE CLEAREST READ ON WHICH CENTRAL BANK IS GOING TO STAY PUT. ALSO AVERSE TO NEGATIVE RATES SO I THINK THEY MAY STAY PUT. IN CANADA AND THE U.S. I THINK INTEREST RATES NEED TO GO HIGHER. IN CANADA, THE MARKETS ARE PRICING SOME CHANCE OF A RATE HIKE BUT IN THE U.S., AS YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE THINKING AND THE MARKETS ARE THINKING INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN BECAUSE OF WHAT TRUMP WANTS . WE WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES. IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING 2026 FOR THE RATES MARKETS FOR SURE. ANNA: COMPLEX FOR ALL OF THE USUAL REASONS AND A SPRINKLING OF POLITICS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE LATEST ON SOME OF THE CENTRAL BANK THINKING AS WE HEAD INTO 2026. A QUICK WORD ON THE MARKETS, QUITE FLAT ON EUROPEAN EQUITIES. NOT MANY OF THE EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE OPEN. WE ARE OPEN IN LONDON, PARIS, AMSTERDAM. GERMANY IS CLOSED, SWITZERLAND IS CLOSE, MANY OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN MARKETS AND NORTHERN EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE CLOSED MOST OF U.S. FUTURES POINTING TO TOUCH LOWER. IT IS CHRISTMAS EVE. HAVE A GOOD HOLIDAY, EVERYBODY.

GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT NEW HIGHS -- AND MERRY CHRISTMAS DO YOU -- WHAT NEW HIGHS WE CAN HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY MARKETS NEXT YEAR? CAMERON: GOOD MORNING AND MERRY CHRISTMAS. IT IS TIME TO DUST OFF THE OLD ADAGE WHICH IS RESPECT THE TREND BUT DON'T IGNORE THE RISKS AS ARE GOING TO 2026. RESPECTING THE TREND APPRECIATES THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL IN AN UPTREND IN THE MARKET, AND IT IS BEING LED BY PROCYCLICAL AREAS. YOU MENTIONED INDUSTRIAL COMMODITIES. YOU ALSO HAVE LEADERSHIP WITH THINGS LIKE BANKS, TRANSPORT STARTING TO TURN HIGHER, SO THERE IS A PROCYCLICAL MESSAGE COMING OUT OF THE MARKET, AND YOU ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT UPTREND IN EARNING ESTIMATES AND GDP ESTIMATES, AND THIS HAS BEEN THE KEY FUNDAMENTAL UNDERPINNING OF WHY WE KEEP GETTING TO WRESTLE WITH NEW HIGHS. AS LONG AS YOU REVISE ESTIMATES HIGHER, THERE'S USUALLY A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR TAKING. THE SECOND HALF OF THAT IS DO NOT IGNORE THE RISKS. THAT IS WHERE WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE VALUATIONS AND SIGNS OF COMPLACENCY IS WITHIN MARKETS, LOOK AT THE VIX TURNING EVER LOWER EACH AND EVERY DAY, SO IT COULD BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE STILL ABLE TO CARVE OUT NEW HIGHS BECAUSE OF THE EARNINGS ESTIMATES, BUT THERE COULD BE SOME VOLATILITY ALONG THE WAY, SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A HIGH MARK WITH VALUATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS, AS WELL. ANNMARIE: BUT YOU THINK POSITIONING IS NOT STRETCHED. WHAT WOULD GET US TO THAT POINT? CAMERON: OUR FAVORITE MEASURE IS LOOKING AT THE DEUTSCHE BANK CONSOLIDATED EQUITY POSITIONING, MEASURING INSTITUTIONAL POSITION. WHAT IS FASCINATING IS WE ARE IN THE 62ND PERCENTILE, SLIGHTLY OVERWEIGHT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT DISCRETIONARY INVESTORS, THEY ARE STILL JUST NEUTRAL. WE THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR MORE PEOPLE TO GET DRAGGED INTO THE MARKET, BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONING, WE HAVE TO MENTION HOUSEHOLDS AND THAT IS WHERE YOU CANNOT MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE UNDERWEIGHT EQUITIES. YOU COULD LOOK AT THE SURVEY THAT LOOKS AT THE POSITIONING. THAT IS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT HAS BEEN SINCE 2018 AND 2022. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MARGIN LOANS HAVE GROWN EXTRAORDINARILY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS AT ABOUT A 40% CLIP, SO THERE ARE SIGNS THAT HOUSEHOLDS ARE FULLY INVESTED, BUT SOME INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS HAVE STILL SAT ON THE SIDELINES, WHICH IS LIKELY WHY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR SO, EVERY DIP HAS GOTTEN BOUGHT SO QUICKLY. SCARLET: TALK ABOUT THE MONEY ON THE SIDELINES, THE DRY POWDER IF THEY WILL. WE TALKED ABOUT MANY MARKET FUNDS AND HOW THERE ARE 70 TRILLION FORMS OF DOLLARS WAITING TO BE DEPLOYED. MAYBE RETAIL INVESTORS ARE FULLY INVESTED, BUT THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD PUT MORE INTO THE MARKET. HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THAT MONEY TO BE PUT TO WORK? CAMERON: WE NEVER CONSIDERED THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS AS FUNGIBLE THAT COULD GO INTO EQUITIES, MEANING THAT THESE WERE SAVINGS AND CASH BALANCES THAT WERE TYPICALLY HELD IN CASH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS VERSUS THINGS THAT WERE JUST ANXIOUS AND WAITING TO GO INTO EQUITIES. SO MAYBE AT THE MARGIN, AS YOU SEE THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS START TO FALL, IT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT LINE STRAIGHT INTO THE EQUITY MARKET. CERTAINLY MONEY MARKET RATES FALLING COULD PUSH INVESTORS INTO LOOKING INTO OTHER AREAS INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING ON THE SIDELINES AND CLIPPING COUPONS -- CLIPPING COUPONS BUT NOT NECESSARILY $7 TRILLION THAT WILL GO INTO EQUITIES. SCARLET: THE CENTER RALLY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, HOW MUCH IS DRIVEN BY TECHNICAL FACTORS LIKE POSITIONING VERSUS TRUE FUNDAMENTALS, EARNINGS GROWTH, AND THE EARNINGS OUTLOOK FOR 2026? CAMERON: THIS TIME OF YEAR WE TRY NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO THE PRICE ACTION GIVEN VOLUME IS SO LIGHT. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE TENDS TO BE SOME KIND OF WINDOWDRESSING AND POSITIONING CHASES TO YEAR END, BUT WHAT IS FASCINATING IS WE SAW THE ROTATION AND LEADERSHIP START A LITTLE EARLY THIS YEAR. TYPICALLY WE SEE LEADERSHIP ROTATIONS WE HAVE YOUR CLASSIC DOWEL, OR THE FIRST TRADE THAT KICKS OFF IN JANUARY AS PEOPLE START TO REBALANCE PORTFOLIOS, BUT IT SEEMED TO START IN NOVEMBER THIS YEAR, WHERE WE SOLVE VALUE, FOR EXAMPLE, OUTPERFORM GROWTH BY 5% SINCE NOVEMBER 1, SO MAYBE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF THAT, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE TRY NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO IT AND LIVE YOUR KIND OF PRICE ACTION, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REFLECT ANYTHING MORE THAN LIKELY POSITIONING CHASING. ANNMARIE: WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMODITY SPACE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM, GOLD, SILVER, PLATINUM, COPPER, DO YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THINK YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN PART OF THIS INTO 2026 OR DO YOU THINK INDIVIDUAL SHOULD MAKE SURE COMMODITIES ARE PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIO? CAMERON: WE SEE COMMODITIES AS A WAY TO HAVE AN INFLATION HEDGE WITHIN PORTFOLIOS, AND THEY WORK REALLY WELL WHEN THEY WORK WELL AND THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL THE GOOD PORTION OF THE TIME, SO WE HAVE BEEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THAT HAS BEEN A VERY POWERFUL UPTREND FOR A LOT OF THESE COMMODITIES. I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH CAN I CONTINUE? DR. GRAFF OF RENAISSANCE MACRO PUT OUT A GREAT PIECE EFFECTIVELY SAYING, WHEN YOU DOUBLED YOUR RETURN IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, THE PROBABILITY OF YOU DOING IT AGAIN IS EXTRAORDINARILY LOW, SO IT GETS BACK TO THIS OVERALL NOTION OF WE ARE NOT IGNORING RISKS. GOLD HAS HAD A POWERFUL UPTREND, THE CHUCK MORSE OF COMMODITIES. NOTHING SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT DOWN, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT LONGER TERM CHARTS, IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY OVERBOUGHT, SO IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING TO SEE SOME KIND OF CONSOLIDATION, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE STILL REMAINS POWERFUL DRIVERS. FOR EXAMPLE, CENTRAL BANK BUYING OF GOLD, BUT ALSO IT HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT 5, MEANING THAT IT HAS BECOME EFFECTIVELY AND MOMENTUM STOCK WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF TRADING IN RETAIL INVESTORS, AS WELL AS INVESTORS OVERSEAS, SO IT COULD GET A LITTLE OVER", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:14:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T15:27:45.616044"}

The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a reading of 53.5.\n“Despite some signs of improvement to close out the year, sentiment remains nearly 30% below December 2024, as pocketbook issues continue to dominate consumer views of the economy,” Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement.\nThe current conditions gauge slid to a record-low of 50.4, while a gauge of expectations climbed to a four-month high. Consumers’ perception of current buying conditions for big-ticket items deteriorated to the lowest on record. Will Auchincloss, Americas Retail Sector Leader at EY-Parthenon, breaks down the state of the consumer. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nConsumers are showing in our monthly surveys that they're getting less and less confident in the economy as the year wears on. And there's several factors that are driving that. One is the job outlook. The biggest reason now, however, is inflation and the continued pressure on essential categories like food, housing, even debt now is sort of emerging as a topic for consumers. And so they are trying to muscle through this environment as best as they can. And that is weighing on the retail sector. And it's it's weighing a little bit on the holiday season as well. But we're seeing some pretty good numbers out of some of the retailers. I mean, I'm seeing, you know, probably three or 4% retail sales growth here in the holiday season with the e-commerce even higher than that. It seems like consumers are still spending, though. They are, Paul, and they are trying to spend on the holiday and kind of keep that basket together as best they can. But there's some underlying factors that make the headline data a little bit more, more nuanced. So the majority of what we're seeing is that that those year over year gains are driven primarily by price actions and not volume. And in fact, in our headline outlook for the for the holiday season, we sort of forecasted about a 2 to 3% year over year growth rate. I think it's coming in a little bit higher, which is good news. But the majority of that is driven by price. Almost two thirds of that is driven by price and not volume. So, you know, as a retail sector, you like to see more volume going out the door historically. And so again, it's a little bit softer. I think part of that is certain chains have really resonated with consumers this this holiday season. They've gotten the value equation better aligned to expectations. And there is some channel switching happening that appears in our survey as well. We're seeing that increase as as consumers want to sort of shop what they've always shop for, but get a better price for it in whatever channel is best suited for them. Yeah, we were talking about somebody earlier talking about shopping earlier in the show and how consumers have become much more intentional about what it is they're spending their money on. But let's talk about restaurants and bars and how we're spending on that. I mean, how did you talk about that in the survey and what did you guys find out? We do. And that that sector in particular is getting much better, is facing much more significant headwinds because it's the first category consumers repeatedly tell us they're going to pull back on. And then and indeed, we're we're seeing that in some of the top line numbers, albeit there are a couple really exciting sort of turnaround stories in the sector that I think shows that point about aligning with consumers. But in general, consumers, the number one category they want to pull back on is eating out, particularly at higher end establishments. And so when they're paying more for groceries and the basics, it kind of makes sense that they would switch to to more in-home eating. And so that really is putting a pressure on restaurants and the QSR space. We've seen a lot of revamped emphasis on value and value menus to try and stem that tide. But it has been a tough year for for the restaurant sector in general, and we don't expect that to change much going into 2026. Will What's typically an anecdote to consumer spending concerns? I'm not sure it's the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points, and it seems like the economy is essentially fully employed. What needs to change here? Yeah, I think it's a couple of things. One is that they have to have more confidence. And, you know, with all the change in the policies coming out of out of the federal government with concerns about inflation really showing up in their, you know, the receipts and some concerns about the economic outlook and a little bit of a I it's it's a it's sort of a psychological aspect of this that's really weighed on the sector. However, there are some real economic drivers because a lot of the GDP growth we're seeing is driven by what we call the three A's. So that's affluent consumers. That's asset price realization in the stock market and. It's so I'm forgetting the third day it's AI driven investment which is dealing the the the sort of the stock price appreciation. So that's propping up a lot of this. And affluent consumers in particular are really need to kind of continue that that that spending pattern as we go into 2026 if we're going to continue at the levels we're content seen today and with in terms of how we're paying for these things and, you know, consumers taking on debt, especially during the holiday season, I know that they're using a lot more buy now, pay later platforms, and that could be troubling down the road. Yeah, that that is a concern for us to monitor. And and savings in general has declined since Liberation Day. Again, as consumers try and buy what they've always purchased, but in the face of higher prices. So we've gone from a savings economy to a debtor economy, and that shows up in the macro data. That is a potential risk in the outlook for for 2026, because the question is how long can they keep doing that? And those debt levels have sort of increased generally across all income segments as well. So it's not just centered in one income segment. That's not we're not reaching sort of crisis levels by any stretch, but it is another potential headwind as we cross into next year.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:50:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T16:32:44.108471"}
{"title": "TheRealReal Sees Resilient Consumers", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-12-24/therealreal-sees-resilient-consumers-video", "summary": "Rati Levesque, The RealReal President & CEO, Bloomberg Open Interest with Vonnie Quinn and Emily Graffeo to speak to the strength of the US consumer. Levesque says the secondary luxury market is strong as more customers look for value. (Source: Bloomberg)", "content": "00:00\n\nWe're seeing the buyer be quite resilient at the REALREAL. We're seeing consumer trends being quite strong around fine jewelry, watches, handbags. We're definitely probably a tariff beneficiary, but at the same time, there's other things kind of impacting our business. Resale is becoming more mainstream. That's number one. And definitely seeing that led by the Gen Z and millennial consumer. We're seeing fine jewelry and watches be very popular, like I mentioned, gold pricing, silver pricing going up. And then we're also seeing gifting becoming less of a stigma of resale. So almost 60% of consumers now say they prefer the secondary market outright. So seeing lingerie and seeing resale specifically becoming much more mainstream right now. Now you've been aggressively cost cutting, restructuring your commissioned model and so on. Is there any danger that you will maybe not get in the supply that you need in order to keep supplying this market? Yeah. So, you know, it's interesting. I think that one one of the things is that there's $200 billion trapped in people's closets. That's just in the U.S. alone. And so we're it's such an untapped industry. At the end of the day, $80 billion gets added to that every year. So, so much got so much luxury goods just in the U.S. alone. And so many of these people have never consigned anything before. So we're seeing people become kind of introduced to luxury for the first time. So double digit new seller growth, for example. So people are really starting to change the way they shop and they're checking the prices in the secondary market before they're even purchasing in the primary market. I wanted to talk about prices, Brodie, because our very own Amanda Bloomberg wrote just a few days ago, 2019, the price of a Chanel flat bag, $5,800. Fast forward to right now, it's over $11,000. I'm wondering just how much the growth of the real real is coming out of the fact that people feel like they just can't they can't stomach the prices in the luxury market. Yes, there's a couple of things happening. Any time the price increases in the primary market. Our pricing goes up, too. So for whatever reasons, whether it's tariffs, whether the pricing of a Chanel that goes up, for whatever reason, our prices go up as well. But like I said, what we're also seeing is more volume coming through. So more people being introduced to luxury and testing it out and then they get that first paycheck, right? They get that first paycheck for the bag and then they go back into the primary market. What we're actually seeing is that circular economy. And so they'll go back into the primary market with their check and buy the newest trend or buy something that they've been eyeing, and then they'll consign two or three things instead. So we'll see that kind of trade up happening as well. And what are the consumers typically gravitating for on the real, real? Are they looking for a bargain on a classic luxury item or are they turning to secondhand markets when they want to buy something trendier? Yeah, So we're seeing that intersection between value and luxury. That's what we offer right at the end of the day. And then you've got very unique items and most of our items you can't buy anywhere else. So they're looking for those one of a kind pieces. You know, they're kind of maybe done with the trends or everything starting to look the same. It's a badge of honor to wear something very unique from the real world. So think of them like drops. Thousands of items get dropped everyday that are very unique to the consumer consumers. That's number one. Buying jewelry, like I mentioned, watches, handbags, vintage is a big one, as is condition. Again, seeing more of that value play come through. People are looking for that value. They'll take something that maybe is in better condition instead of pristine condition, just that it costs a little less at the end of the day. You know, there are competitors out there now, fashion file, rebuy and so on. How do you compete with them? Yeah. So, you know, when I think about the real, real, it's really around we offer very in-depth in product. So we don't offer just one category, right? It's handbags, it's jewelry, watches, fashion, textiles, silverware, all of that we're offering at the real, real. So there's a lot of and then we give you cash up front. And that's really important, right? Versus trade up or trading and then you earn the most with us. And that's really important to say. And the reason why is because of the trust that we built with the consumer. Because we know because you can sign with us, because we've got almost 50 million members now that we built trust with because of our pricing algorithm. Yes, you can earn the most with us at the end of the day. I'm curious as well, how much are your physical stores contributing? Are they contributing to the bottom line? And, you know, is it just a marketing play at the end of the day? And when does that bottom line, by the way, turn positive? Yeah. So the stores pay back very quickly, actually. And what we see is a halo impact. So it's meeting the consignor where they are, whether they want to drop off in the store on their way to work, whether they want a van pick up at 3 p.m. this afternoon on demand, they'll can book that from their app. And we're seeing the consignor the seller can more items when they interact with the store and more high value items because they're meeting with a gemologist and watchmaker. So yes, it's a place that people get introduced to our being, our brand, where a quarter of our new consignors come from, the stores, from our retail locations. But we more see a halo impact. So from the Consignor consigning more for us with us and then spending more at the end of the day to.", "language": "en", "category": "finance", "source": "https://feeds.bloomberg.com/markets/news.rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:38:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T16:57:25.170853"}
