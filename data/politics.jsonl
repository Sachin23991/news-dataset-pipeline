At least three people were killed, according to Ukrainian officials, including a four-year-old child, while energy infrastructure was also targeted, leaving several regions without power. Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed. Zelensky said \"people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe\" in the run-up to Christmas, and said the strikes sent \"an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities\" despite ongoing peace talks.\n\nHe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia\". Zelensky had previously warned it was in the Kremlin's \"nature\" to \"carry out massive attacks\" during the festive period. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nLocal authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death. Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added. Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service. An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said. Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit. Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia. Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant. The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.\n\nReuters Emergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capital\n\nWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\". The main focus of Russian attacks in recent days has been the southern port city of Odesa, which comes after Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. The Russian president made the threat in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on tankers belonging to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", vessels used to move goods including oil which are under Western sanctions.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:11:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:57.119660"}

Germany’s humanitarian budget of €1.05bn (£920m) for 2026 will be less than half of last year’s, with spending refocused on areas deemed a priority to Europe.\n\n“I think we are losing a consensus of solidarity and responsibility which has been established for a while now,” said Ralf Südhoff, director of the Berlin-based Centre for Humanitarian Action.\n\n“Germany this year has started to phase out Latin America, decreased engagement in Asia and say they want to focus now on crises which have an impact on Europe,” he said, noting that while Ukraine was in need of funding because of Russia’s invasion, its location in Europe meant it was saved from the cuts developing countries have experienced.\n\nThe UK also announced earlier this year that it would be cutting aid to fund defence spending. Norway has increased its civilian support to Ukraine by 2.5bn kroner (£185m), to a quarter of its aid budget, but has been accused of making Africa pay for that rise with a 355m kroner cut (£26m).\n\nFrance’s budget for 2026 will also see a €700m cut to aid spending, with a 60% reduction in food aid, while increasing defence spending by €6.7bn.\n\n“It’s a broader geopolitical trend and there’s a misleading belief by European actors that they have to play this game now in the same way as Moscow, Beijing, Washington,” said Südhoff, suggesting aid will be more “transactional” and directed to where donors see direct benefits for themselves. “The reaction now is not to fill the gap or attempt to do so but to follow the [American] cuts.”\n\nAnalysis of Germany’s 2026 aid budget by Venro, a coalition of German NGOs, shows that the country is slashing funding to traditional development and poverty-reduction programmes, with a 20% cut for the World Food Programme and 33% for the Gavi vaccine alliance.\n\nOne of the few elements of the budget not cut is Germany’s partnerships with the private sector in developing countries.\n\nAnita Kattakuzhy, director of policy at Near, a coalition of civil society groups in the global south, said a wider pattern is emerging among donors.\n\n“Budgets are being reshaped under political pressure, and the communities who bear the consequences have no way to shape those decisions,” said Kattakuzhy.\n\n“Cutting funding in this way may meet short-term priorities in donor capitals, but it destabilises the local systems that are keeping crises from getting worse.”\n\nAmong the countries most affected by aid cuts is Mozambique, which has suffered from cyclones and droughts as well as a resurgent conflict in the country’s Cabo Delgado province that has displaced more than 300,000 people since July.\n\nThe country has received only $31m of $222m funding required this year, leading to food distribution happening only every two months and covering 39% of caloric needs, according to the UN.\n\nThe cutting of development funding by Sweden will directly hit programmes used to rehabilitate and provide healthcare and education to people displaced by the insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, which began in 2017.\n\nAll four of the African countries removed from Sweden’s development funding have seen cuts for HIV/Aids services, as experts warn there will be a reversal of years of progress in fighting the disease.\n\nMozambique, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are among six countries, along with Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia – that could bear the brunt of cuts to health programmes tackling HIV/Aids, according to analysis by the Boston Consultant Group.\n\nIlaria Manunza, country director for Save the Children Mozambique, said aid cuts have already made 2025 very difficult: “Every cut compounds the risk of long-term developmental setbacks, particularly in education and child protection,” said Manunza. “If current trends continue, 2026 will be extremely challenging … there is a real risk that progress made over the past decade could be reversed.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:00:05 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:58.250661"}

The murder of Marius Van der Merwe, 41, reignited a debate about the targeting of whistleblowers who provide information related to crime and corruption.\n\nSouth Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, with an average of 63 people a day killed between April and September this year, according to police data.\n\nIn one of the worst mass shootings in recent years, 18 relatives were shot dead at a rural homestead in the Eastern Cape province in September 2024.

The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending. But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\n\n\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\". \"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added. The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%. It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply, bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:56:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:32:09.831119"}
