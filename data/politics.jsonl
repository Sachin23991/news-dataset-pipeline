At least three people were killed, according to Ukrainian officials, including a four-year-old child, while energy infrastructure was also targeted, leaving several regions without power. Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed. Zelensky said \"people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe\" in the run-up to Christmas, and said the strikes sent \"an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities\" despite ongoing peace talks.\n\nHe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia\". Zelensky had previously warned it was in the Kremlin's \"nature\" to \"carry out massive attacks\" during the festive period. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nLocal authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death. Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added. Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service. An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said. Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit. Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia. Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant. The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.\n\nReuters Emergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capital\n\nWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\". The main focus of Russian attacks in recent days has been the southern port city of Odesa, which comes after Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. The Russian president made the threat in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on tankers belonging to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", vessels used to move goods including oil which are under Western sanctions.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:11:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:57.119660"}

Germany’s humanitarian budget of €1.05bn (£920m) for 2026 will be less than half of last year’s, with spending refocused on areas deemed a priority to Europe.\n\n“I think we are losing a consensus of solidarity and responsibility which has been established for a while now,” said Ralf Südhoff, director of the Berlin-based Centre for Humanitarian Action.\n\n“Germany this year has started to phase out Latin America, decreased engagement in Asia and say they want to focus now on crises which have an impact on Europe,” he said, noting that while Ukraine was in need of funding because of Russia’s invasion, its location in Europe meant it was saved from the cuts developing countries have experienced.\n\nThe UK also announced earlier this year that it would be cutting aid to fund defence spending. Norway has increased its civilian support to Ukraine by 2.5bn kroner (£185m), to a quarter of its aid budget, but has been accused of making Africa pay for that rise with a 355m kroner cut (£26m).\n\nFrance’s budget for 2026 will also see a €700m cut to aid spending, with a 60% reduction in food aid, while increasing defence spending by €6.7bn.\n\n“It’s a broader geopolitical trend and there’s a misleading belief by European actors that they have to play this game now in the same way as Moscow, Beijing, Washington,” said Südhoff, suggesting aid will be more “transactional” and directed to where donors see direct benefits for themselves. “The reaction now is not to fill the gap or attempt to do so but to follow the [American] cuts.”\n\nAnalysis of Germany’s 2026 aid budget by Venro, a coalition of German NGOs, shows that the country is slashing funding to traditional development and poverty-reduction programmes, with a 20% cut for the World Food Programme and 33% for the Gavi vaccine alliance.\n\nOne of the few elements of the budget not cut is Germany’s partnerships with the private sector in developing countries.\n\nAnita Kattakuzhy, director of policy at Near, a coalition of civil society groups in the global south, said a wider pattern is emerging among donors.\n\n“Budgets are being reshaped under political pressure, and the communities who bear the consequences have no way to shape those decisions,” said Kattakuzhy.\n\n“Cutting funding in this way may meet short-term priorities in donor capitals, but it destabilises the local systems that are keeping crises from getting worse.”\n\nAmong the countries most affected by aid cuts is Mozambique, which has suffered from cyclones and droughts as well as a resurgent conflict in the country’s Cabo Delgado province that has displaced more than 300,000 people since July.\n\nThe country has received only $31m of $222m funding required this year, leading to food distribution happening only every two months and covering 39% of caloric needs, according to the UN.\n\nThe cutting of development funding by Sweden will directly hit programmes used to rehabilitate and provide healthcare and education to people displaced by the insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, which began in 2017.\n\nAll four of the African countries removed from Sweden’s development funding have seen cuts for HIV/Aids services, as experts warn there will be a reversal of years of progress in fighting the disease.\n\nMozambique, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are among six countries, along with Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia – that could bear the brunt of cuts to health programmes tackling HIV/Aids, according to analysis by the Boston Consultant Group.\n\nIlaria Manunza, country director for Save the Children Mozambique, said aid cuts have already made 2025 very difficult: “Every cut compounds the risk of long-term developmental setbacks, particularly in education and child protection,” said Manunza. “If current trends continue, 2026 will be extremely challenging … there is a real risk that progress made over the past decade could be reversed.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:00:05 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:58.250661"}

The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending. But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\n\n\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\". \"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added. The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%. It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply, bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:56:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:32:09.831119"}

On the Epstein investigation, the DOJ's note reads \"the investigation to date has revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation\". The document also underlined that Andrew was not a \"target\" of the investigation and no evidence had been gathered that he had committed any crime under US law.

The 11,000-plus documents continue a stream of released information that began on Friday, the deadline mandated in a new law that required the department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the deceased paedophile and financier. Many of the documents released on Tuesday are redacted with names and information blacked out, including names of people who the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case. The justice department is facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law specifically states can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations. President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated Trump flew on Epstein's jet. The justice department said some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump. Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.\n\nEmail exchange between 'A' and Ghislaine Maxwell about 'girls'\n\nOf the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" stands out. The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\". \"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\" The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\". An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\". Email by 'A' from 'Balmoral' asked Ghislaine Maxwell for 'inappropriate friends', Epstein files show\n\nWho and what are in the Epstein files?\n\nWhat the underwhelming Epstein files release means for Trump and Maga Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru. In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\". The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response.\n\nFBI email lists out 10 alleged co-conspirators to Epstein\n\nUS Department of Justice\n\nAmong the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein. The emails said six of the 10 co-conspirators had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut. Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\". Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file. Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner. An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\". The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier. Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\". \"Mr. Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said. Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DOJ. \"There's 10 co-conspirators potentially that we knew nothing about that the DOJ had been investigating,\" Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency. The law passed by Congress and signed by President Trump states names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted and specifically asks the justice department for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions concerning \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".\n\nJustice Department says Epstein letter to Larry Nassar is a fake\n\nGetty Images Larry Nassar\n\nA letter included in the released batch of documents got a lot of attention online. But, according to the justice department, it is fake. The handwritten letter and envelope at first appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes. \"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the faux letter states. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\" The writer signs it, \"Life is unfair, Yours, J. Epstein.\" The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent back to a Manhattan jail where Epstein was detained before his death. The FBI was alerted to the returned letter and requested an analysis of it. That request was also included in the releases batch of documents. The justice department on Tuesday called the letter a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it. \"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X. \"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" they added. Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died. Even before the justice department's announcement of it being fake, the documents raised immediate questions. The return sender was listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was \"Metropolitan Correctional Center\". The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI. A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison. Nassar is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nTrump's travels aboard Epstein's private jet\n\nGetty Images\n\nTrump's name appears more in these files than in other batches of documents released by the justice department. Notably, in a January 2020 email, a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\". The recipient of the email was redacted. Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\". Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999. The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted. Trump travelled on Epstein's plane more than previously thought, prosecutor says\n\nImage in Epstein files that features Trump reinstated after backlash\n\nClinton and Trump - Two US presidents and their long associations with Jeffrey Epstein \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\" The timing of the trips coincide with years in which federal prosecutors were examining Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. She was ultimately found guilty of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse minors. But throughout the files released on Tuesday, many of the other mentions of Trump's name are simply in press clippings mentioning him, his campaigns, and other news moments. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in regards to Epstein. In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the Department of Justice said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\". \"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,\" the justice department said.\n\nFake video of Epstein included", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:08:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T02:10:57.679496"}

The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community. The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.\"\n\n\"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,\" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday. Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament. Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country. It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month. Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute. Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition.\n\nBeatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states. In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\". The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:11:10 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T22:26:08.958858"}

She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety.\n\nIn a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes.\n\nThe Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCombs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters.\n\nDuring a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.\n\nThe jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. That bid was not successful.\n\nAhead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years.\n\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\".\n\nCombs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison.\n\nIt argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\".\n\nBefore Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\"\n\n\"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\"\n\nCombs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation.

More than 1 million people have been displaced, many of them two, three or even four times.\n\nNeither the Mozambican army nor a Rwandan intervention have managed to quell the insurgency, which has ravaged northern Mozambique since October 2017, when militants from Islamic State-Mozambique, an affiliate of the main IS group in the Middle East, carried out their first attacks, in Mocímboa da Praia in Cabo Delgado province in the north-east.\n\nThe group drew global attention in March 2021 with an attack on the town of Palma. More than 600 people were killed in the assault and the military’s subsequent recapturing of the town, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a non-profit conflict monitor, including foreign workers on a multibillion-dollar Total liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.\n\nRwanda, whose military is better equipped and trained than Mozambique’s, deployed 1,000 troops to Cabo Delgado in July 2021, initially pushing back the militants.

After eight years … there are no effective initiatives of dialogue.”\n\nHe said much of the military effort was focused on securing the estimated $20bn LNG project, which Total said in October it would resume once it received government approval.\n\nNhamirre said: “First you need to ask what [objective] the Rwandan and Mozambican forces had. If it is to guarantee human security, then we can say that they have failed … But if the objective is to secure the LNG project, then they have achieved some success … The LNG project is definitely more secure than in 2021.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Displaced survivors of an attack by IS-linked militants arriving at Pemba port, Mozambique, in April 2021.

In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that there had been sharp increase in such kidnappings.\n\nSheila Nhancale, a researcher for HRW, said: “The displacement that is happening now is also increasing the risk of sexual violence, exploitation and abuse, particularly for women and children. Of the 100,000 displaced [in November], 70,000 are children.”\n\nPeople forced to flee are also facing shrinking support. Donors have given $195m to the humanitarian response this year – only 55% of the estimated need – compared with $246m last year, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nSebastián Traficante, the head of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières in Mozambique, said displaced people “have to stay in places with very poor conditions, with very poor access to basic services … that are already affected by eight years of conflict.\n\n“They just want this to end.

An earlier statement posted by the command on X said the strike had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but that statement was later removed. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said he was “grateful for Nigerian government support + cooperation”.\n\nNigeria’s foreign ministry said the strikes were carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the US, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups. “This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,” the ministry said in a post on X.\n\nTrump has previously said he would launch a “guns-a-blazing” US military intervention in Nigeria, claiming that the country’s government has been inadequate in its efforts to prevent attacks on Christians by Islamist groups.\n\nNigeria is officially a secular country but its population is almost evenly divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, especially among the religious right in America, and it has often been framed as religious persecution.\n\nHowever, Nigeria’s government rejects framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution, saying in the past that armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and US claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But the government has previously agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups.\n\nMany analysts say the situation is complex and has long roots in the region’s history. In some parts of the country, clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water.\n\nPriests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom, but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.\n\nTrump, who positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in 2024, campaigned on the promise of extraditing the US from decades of “endless wars”. However his first year back in the White House has been notable for the number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on Yemen, Iran, Syria and others, as well as a huge military buildup in the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:41:22 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T02:20:46.646311"}

Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also so far ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, tells the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods – but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:09:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T05:01:10.478342"}
