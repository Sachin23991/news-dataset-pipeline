At least three people were killed, according to Ukrainian officials, including a four-year-old child, while energy infrastructure was also targeted, leaving several regions without power. Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed. Zelensky said \"people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe\" in the run-up to Christmas, and said the strikes sent \"an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities\" despite ongoing peace talks.\n\nHe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia\". Zelensky had previously warned it was in the Kremlin's \"nature\" to \"carry out massive attacks\" during the festive period. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nLocal authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death. Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added. Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service. An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said. Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit. Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia. Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant. The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.\n\nReuters Emergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capital\n\nWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\". The main focus of Russian attacks in recent days has been the southern port city of Odesa, which comes after Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. The Russian president made the threat in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on tankers belonging to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", vessels used to move goods including oil which are under Western sanctions.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:11:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:57.119660"}

Germany’s humanitarian budget of €1.05bn (£920m) for 2026 will be less than half of last year’s, with spending refocused on areas deemed a priority to Europe.\n\n“I think we are losing a consensus of solidarity and responsibility which has been established for a while now,” said Ralf Südhoff, director of the Berlin-based Centre for Humanitarian Action.\n\n“Germany this year has started to phase out Latin America, decreased engagement in Asia and say they want to focus now on crises which have an impact on Europe,” he said, noting that while Ukraine was in need of funding because of Russia’s invasion, its location in Europe meant it was saved from the cuts developing countries have experienced.\n\nThe UK also announced earlier this year that it would be cutting aid to fund defence spending. Norway has increased its civilian support to Ukraine by 2.5bn kroner (£185m), to a quarter of its aid budget, but has been accused of making Africa pay for that rise with a 355m kroner cut (£26m).\n\nFrance’s budget for 2026 will also see a €700m cut to aid spending, with a 60% reduction in food aid, while increasing defence spending by €6.7bn.\n\n“It’s a broader geopolitical trend and there’s a misleading belief by European actors that they have to play this game now in the same way as Moscow, Beijing, Washington,” said Südhoff, suggesting aid will be more “transactional” and directed to where donors see direct benefits for themselves. “The reaction now is not to fill the gap or attempt to do so but to follow the [American] cuts.”\n\nAnalysis of Germany’s 2026 aid budget by Venro, a coalition of German NGOs, shows that the country is slashing funding to traditional development and poverty-reduction programmes, with a 20% cut for the World Food Programme and 33% for the Gavi vaccine alliance.\n\nOne of the few elements of the budget not cut is Germany’s partnerships with the private sector in developing countries.\n\nAnita Kattakuzhy, director of policy at Near, a coalition of civil society groups in the global south, said a wider pattern is emerging among donors.\n\n“Budgets are being reshaped under political pressure, and the communities who bear the consequences have no way to shape those decisions,” said Kattakuzhy.\n\n“Cutting funding in this way may meet short-term priorities in donor capitals, but it destabilises the local systems that are keeping crises from getting worse.”\n\nAmong the countries most affected by aid cuts is Mozambique, which has suffered from cyclones and droughts as well as a resurgent conflict in the country’s Cabo Delgado province that has displaced more than 300,000 people since July.\n\nThe country has received only $31m of $222m funding required this year, leading to food distribution happening only every two months and covering 39% of caloric needs, according to the UN.\n\nThe cutting of development funding by Sweden will directly hit programmes used to rehabilitate and provide healthcare and education to people displaced by the insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, which began in 2017.\n\nAll four of the African countries removed from Sweden’s development funding have seen cuts for HIV/Aids services, as experts warn there will be a reversal of years of progress in fighting the disease.\n\nMozambique, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are among six countries, along with Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia – that could bear the brunt of cuts to health programmes tackling HIV/Aids, according to analysis by the Boston Consultant Group.\n\nIlaria Manunza, country director for Save the Children Mozambique, said aid cuts have already made 2025 very difficult: “Every cut compounds the risk of long-term developmental setbacks, particularly in education and child protection,” said Manunza. “If current trends continue, 2026 will be extremely challenging … there is a real risk that progress made over the past decade could be reversed.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:00:05 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:58.250661"}

The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending. But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\n\n\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\". \"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added. The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%. It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply, bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:56:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:32:09.831119"}

On the Epstein investigation, the DOJ's note reads \"the investigation to date has revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation\". The document also underlined that Andrew was not a \"target\" of the investigation and no evidence had been gathered that he had committed any crime under US law.

The 11,000-plus documents continue a stream of released information that began on Friday, the deadline mandated in a new law that required the department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the deceased paedophile and financier. Many of the documents released on Tuesday are redacted with names and information blacked out, including names of people who the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case. The justice department is facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law specifically states can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations. President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated Trump flew on Epstein's jet. The justice department said some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump. Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.\n\nEmail exchange between 'A' and Ghislaine Maxwell about 'girls'\n\nOf the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" stands out. The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\". \"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\" The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\". An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\". Email by 'A' from 'Balmoral' asked Ghislaine Maxwell for 'inappropriate friends', Epstein files show\n\nWho and what are in the Epstein files?\n\nWhat the underwhelming Epstein files release means for Trump and Maga Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru. In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\". The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response.\n\nFBI email lists out 10 alleged co-conspirators to Epstein\n\nUS Department of Justice\n\nAmong the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein. The emails said six of the 10 co-conspirators had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut. Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\". Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file. Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner. An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\". The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier. Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\". \"Mr. Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said. Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DOJ. \"There's 10 co-conspirators potentially that we knew nothing about that the DOJ had been investigating,\" Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency. The law passed by Congress and signed by President Trump states names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted and specifically asks the justice department for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions concerning \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".\n\nJustice Department says Epstein letter to Larry Nassar is a fake\n\nGetty Images Larry Nassar\n\nA letter included in the released batch of documents got a lot of attention online. But, according to the justice department, it is fake. The handwritten letter and envelope at first appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes. \"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the faux letter states. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\" The writer signs it, \"Life is unfair, Yours, J. Epstein.\" The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent back to a Manhattan jail where Epstein was detained before his death. The FBI was alerted to the returned letter and requested an analysis of it. That request was also included in the releases batch of documents. The justice department on Tuesday called the letter a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it. \"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X. \"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" they added. Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died. Even before the justice department's announcement of it being fake, the documents raised immediate questions. The return sender was listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was \"Metropolitan Correctional Center\". The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI. A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison. Nassar is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nTrump's travels aboard Epstein's private jet\n\nGetty Images\n\nTrump's name appears more in these files than in other batches of documents released by the justice department. Notably, in a January 2020 email, a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\". The recipient of the email was redacted. Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\". Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999. The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted. Trump travelled on Epstein's plane more than previously thought, prosecutor says\n\nImage in Epstein files that features Trump reinstated after backlash\n\nClinton and Trump - Two US presidents and their long associations with Jeffrey Epstein \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\" The timing of the trips coincide with years in which federal prosecutors were examining Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. She was ultimately found guilty of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse minors. But throughout the files released on Tuesday, many of the other mentions of Trump's name are simply in press clippings mentioning him, his campaigns, and other news moments. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in regards to Epstein. In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the Department of Justice said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\". \"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,\" the justice department said.\n\nFake video of Epstein included", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:08:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T02:10:57.679496"}

The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community. The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.\"\n\n\"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,\" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday. Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament. Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country. It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month. Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute. Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition.\n\nBeatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states. In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\". The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:11:10 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T22:26:08.958858"}

She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety.\n\nIn a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes.\n\nThe Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCombs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters.\n\nDuring a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.\n\nThe jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. That bid was not successful.\n\nAhead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years.\n\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\".\n\nCombs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison.\n\nIt argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\".\n\nBefore Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\"\n\n\"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\"\n\nCombs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation.

More than 1 million people have been displaced, many of them two, three or even four times.\n\nNeither the Mozambican army nor a Rwandan intervention have managed to quell the insurgency, which has ravaged northern Mozambique since October 2017, when militants from Islamic State-Mozambique, an affiliate of the main IS group in the Middle East, carried out their first attacks, in Mocímboa da Praia in Cabo Delgado province in the north-east.\n\nThe group drew global attention in March 2021 with an attack on the town of Palma. More than 600 people were killed in the assault and the military’s subsequent recapturing of the town, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a non-profit conflict monitor, including foreign workers on a multibillion-dollar Total liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.\n\nRwanda, whose military is better equipped and trained than Mozambique’s, deployed 1,000 troops to Cabo Delgado in July 2021, initially pushing back the militants.

After eight years … there are no effective initiatives of dialogue.”\n\nHe said much of the military effort was focused on securing the estimated $20bn LNG project, which Total said in October it would resume once it received government approval.\n\nNhamirre said: “First you need to ask what [objective] the Rwandan and Mozambican forces had. If it is to guarantee human security, then we can say that they have failed … But if the objective is to secure the LNG project, then they have achieved some success … The LNG project is definitely more secure than in 2021.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Displaced survivors of an attack by IS-linked militants arriving at Pemba port, Mozambique, in April 2021.

In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that there had been sharp increase in such kidnappings.\n\nSheila Nhancale, a researcher for HRW, said: “The displacement that is happening now is also increasing the risk of sexual violence, exploitation and abuse, particularly for women and children. Of the 100,000 displaced [in November], 70,000 are children.”\n\nPeople forced to flee are also facing shrinking support. Donors have given $195m to the humanitarian response this year – only 55% of the estimated need – compared with $246m last year, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nSebastián Traficante, the head of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières in Mozambique, said displaced people “have to stay in places with very poor conditions, with very poor access to basic services … that are already affected by eight years of conflict.\n\n“They just want this to end.

Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, especially among the religious right in America, and it has often been framed as religious persecution.\n\nHowever, Nigeria’s government rejects framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution, saying in the past that armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and US claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But the government has previously agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups.\n\nMany analysts say the situation is complex and has long roots in the region’s history. In some parts of the country, clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water.\n\nPriests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom, but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.\n\nTrump, who positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in 2024, campaigned on the promise of extraditing the US from decades of “endless wars”.

Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also so far ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, tells the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods – but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:09:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T05:01:10.478342"}

Zelensky said he expected the meeting to take place on Sunday and to focus on a US-brokered 20-point peace plan, as well as separate proposals for US security guarantees. Meanwhile, the Kremlin says President Vladimir Putin's senior aide has held further talks with US officials over the phone, and that Russia has committed to continuing with the negotiations. Russia has spoken of \"slow but steady progress\" in talks but has not commented on Zelensky's offer to withdraw troops from the eastern Donbas, if Russia pulls back too.\n\nUkraine has sought to secure guarantees from the US as part of a deal, and Zelensky has suggested that a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" is a potential option for areas of Donbas that Russia has failed to take by force. On Friday, Zelensky said he had received an update on the latest technical talks from his most senior negotiator, Rustem Umerov. He wrote on social media: \"We are not losing a single day. We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year.\" A White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump in February, the first after the US president returned to office, descended into a hostile shouting match, though their most recent meeting at the White House in October was far more amicable.\n\nReuters Ukrainian soldiers were pictured eating a Christmas meal together as fighting continued along the front line\n\nConfirmation of planned top-level talks came after the Ukrainian leader said he had spoken to Trump's chief negotiators, special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, for an hour over the phone on Christmas Day. He said the latest round of negotiations had generated \"new ideas\" on how to end the war, and described it as a \"really good conversation\". The White House has proposed establishing what would in effect be a demilitarised zone in eastern Ukraine where both sides agree not to deploy troops - a compromise that would avoid settling the intractable question of legal ownership over the contested territory. Zelensky signalled on Wednesday that if Ukraine were to pull back by up to 40km (25 miles) from the front line in the east to create an economic zone, then Russia would have to do the same from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's industrial heartland in the Donbas. Ukraine has secured a number of changes to an earlier 28-point draft plan, which was formulated by Steve Witkoff but widely seen as being favourable to Russia. Zelensky told reporters on Friday that the weekend talks in Florida would focus on several documents, including US security guarantees and a separate economic agreement. However, Zelensky has repeatedly said the question of territory has proved to be the most difficult issue to resolve, along with the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The White House has proposed Ukraine and Russia split the energy generated by the plant, the largest in Europe.

The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law.\n\nOn Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.\n\nBut the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.\n\nOn Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.\n\nThe 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.\n\nInvestigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.\n\nNajib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who has maintained his innocence but remains at large.\n\nBut the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib guilty of embezzlement in 2020.\n\nThat year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.\n\nHe was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term halved last year.\n\nThe latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013. Najib said he had believed the money was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah - a claim rejected by the judge on Friday.\n\nSeparately Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, was sentenced to ten years in jail in 2022 for bribery. She is free on bail pending an appeal against her conviction.\n\nThe scandal has had profound repercussions on Malaysian politics.

The [Pentagon] is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come …\n\n“Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation. Merry Christmas!”\n\nNigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said on Friday that the US strikes, which came after Trump had accused Nigeria’s government of failing to stop Christians being killed in the country, were “part of joint ongoing operations”.\n\nNigeria is officially secular and its population is almost evenly split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn attention from the religious right in the US, which has framed it as persecution. Nigeria’s government has pointed out that armed groups target Christians and Muslims.\n\nNigeria provided the intelligence for the airstrikes in Sokoto state, Tuggar told the country’s Channels Television on Friday. He said he had spoken to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for 19 minutes, then called the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, to get his go-ahead, before speaking to Rubio again for another five minutes.\n\n“We have been working closely with the Americans,” Tuggar said. “This is what we’ve always been hoping for, to work with the Americans, to work with other countries, to combat terrorism, to stop the death of innocent Nigerians … It’s a collaborative effort.”\n\nThe US military’s Africa Command (Africom) said the strikes in Sokoto state had been carried out in coordination with Nigerian authorities. An earlier Africom statement posted on X and then removed said they had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities.\n\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\n\n“I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”\n\nNeither the US nor the Nigerian authorities have said if anyone was killed in the airstrikes. Asked if there would be more, Tuggar said: “You can call it a new phase of an old conflict. For us it is something that is ongoing.”\n\nUS planes conducted surveillance missions over the region earlier this month. It is believed they were using an airport in neighbouring Ghana as a base.\n\nForests in Sokoto, which is bordered by Niger to the north, have been used as bases by gangs of armed bandits and members of Islamic State – Sahel Province (ISSP) , known locally as Lakurawa. Some analysts say the IS branch started when a group of herders joined together to fight bandits in the absence of state support. The state is mostly Muslim.\n\nClashes between Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of Nigeria have been aggravated by ethnicity and religion, but their roots lie in competition for land and water.\n\nPriests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.\n\nTuggar said the operation was about “protecting Nigerians and innocent lives”, not one religion or another. “The president emphasised yesterday, before he gave it the go-ahead, that it must be made clear that … it is a joint operation,” he said. “It is not targeting any religion, nor is it simply in the name of one religion or another.”\n\nA day before the Sokoto strikes, a Christmas Eve suicide bombing at a mosque in north-east Nigeria killed at least five people and left more than 30 seriously injured. The Nigerian army attributed the attack to the jihadist group Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in the region for almost two decades, mostly separate to the violence in the north-west.\n\nThere have been almost 6,000 incidents of violence in Nigeria in 2025, about half of them attacks targeting civilians, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (Acled), a non-profit conflict monitor. The state of Katsina, another Muslim-majority state two states to the east of Sokoto, had the highest number of incidents at 706. Sokoto had the fourth highest, 353.\n\nTrump positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in the 2024 US presidential election, campaigning on a promise of extricating Washington from decades of “endless wars”.\n\nHowever, the first year of his second term in the White House has been notable for a number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on countries including Yemen, Iran and Syria, as well as a huge military buildup in the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:41:45 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T15:27:37.920127"}

Somaliland controls the north-west tip of Somalia, where it operates a de facto state, and is bordered by Djibouti to the north and Ethiopia to the west and south.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office said the declaration was “in the spirit” of the Abraham accords, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and mostly Arab states signed in 2020.\n\nIt posted a video of Benjamin Netanyahu speaking via video call with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, in which he invited him to visit Israel and described the friendship between the two countries as “historic”. Abdullahi said he would be “glad to be in Jerusalem as soon as possible”.\n\nSa’ar said the recognition came after a year of dialogue between the two countries and that he had instructed Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs to immediately “institutionalise ties between the two countries”.\n\nIsraeli analysts have said that recognition of the breakaway state could be in Israel’s strategic interest, given Somaliland’s proximity to Yemen, where Israel has conducted extensive airstrikes against the Houthi rebels over the past two years.\n\nA report in November by the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli thinktank, said: “Somaliland’s territory could serve as a forward base for multiple missions: intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and their armament efforts; logistical support for Yemen’s legitimate government in its war against them; and a platform for direct operations against the Houthis.”\n\nThe Somaliland authorities already host a military base operated by the United Arab Emirates in Berbera, which has a military port and an airstrip for fighter jets and transport aircraft. Analysts have suggested that the base is a key part of the UAE’s anti-Houthi campaign in Yemen.\n\nSomaliland’s president revealed in May that US military officials, including the most senior officer in the Horn of Africa, had visited Somaliland and that another US delegation was expected to visit soon. “It’s a matter of time. Not if, but when and who will lead the recognition of Somaliland,” Abdullahi told the Guardian.\n\nProject 2025, which was published in 2023 and is alleged to have guided much of the doctrine of Donald Trump’s second administration, called for the recognition of Somaliland as a “hedge against the US’s deteriorating position in Djibouti”, where Chinese influence is growing.\n\nThis August, the Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz wrote to Trump asking him to recognise Somaliland. Cruz said Somaliland was an ally of Israel and that it had expressed support for the Abraham accords.\n\nThe US administration is reportedly split over the recognition of Somaliland, with some fearing such a move could endanger military cooperation with Somalia. The US has troops deployed there, where it supports Somali forces in their fight against the Islamist movement al-Shabaab.\n\nSomaliland has a population of a little more than 6.2 million. The breakaway state has a democratic system that has had peaceful transfers of power, though the Washington-based non-profit organisation Freedom House noted an “erosion of political rights and civic space” in recent years, with journalists and opposition figures facing repression from authorities.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:34:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:43:13.946860"}

He had been detained in jail two years beyond his five-year sentence as the Cairo authorities refused to recognise the period he held in pre-trial detention as part of his time served.\n\nA previous attempt by Abd el-Fattah to leave Cairo for London in November after his release from jail, was blocked by the security forces a month ago. He has since been trying to negotiate an agreement whereby he is allowed to travel freely between Cairo and London and not be permanently excluded from Egypt if he came to the UK.\n\nHis arrival in London was announced by his mother, Laila Soueif, on Facebook.\n\nHis sister Mona Seif said: “I can’t believe it’s finally happened and Alaa has made it to London. We thought it was impossible, but here he is. Hundreds of people around the world did so much to help bring this moment about. Alaa is free and we can finally begin to heal as a family.”\n\nThe family believe the agreement will allow him to travel back and forth between the UK and Egypt.\n\nJames Lynch of FairSquare, a human rights organisation that has worked alongside Abd el-Fattah’s family for several years, said: “I’m delighted that Alaa has safely returned to the UK to be reunited with his son after such a lengthy ordeal lasting well over a decade. After everything Alaa and his family have been through, I’m hopeful this marks the beginning of a new chapter for them.”\n\n0:57 Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah reunited with family after release from prison – video\n\nHis mother twice came close to death when she was admitted to hospital during an extended eight-month hunger strike designed to put pressure on the UK Foreign Office to do more to secure his release.\n\nThe British prime minister, Keir Starmer, made three calls to his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end his detention. But the Egyptians never allowed British consular visits to jail, saying they did not recognise his dual citizenship status.\n\nChanges in the Egyptian embassy in London may have helped produce a less inflexible stance.\n\nAbd el-Fattah, from a family of human rights activists, became a leading voice during the Arab spring. He has a direct, perceptive, non-sectarian writing style that has won him awards.\n\nHe has a teenage son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton and attends a special educational needs school. The boy visited him in Cairo soon after his release, in what was regarded as a successful reunion.\n\nAbd el-Fattah’s sister, Sana, explained at the time he had been blocked from flying out of Cairo: “We’re really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly.”\n\n“Khaled needs his father. My nephew … is very, very comfortable in his school and his setup in Brighton. We can’t change. We can’t keep creating instability.”\n\nHe had already served a five-year jail sentence passed in September 2019 on charges of “spreading false news” after a much-criticised trial, yet last year his family were told he would not be released until January 2027.\n\nStarmer made no criticism of the justice of Abd el-Fattah’s sentencing. “I’m delighted that Alaa is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief,” the prime minister wrote on social media. “I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment.\n\n“Alaa’s case has been a top priority for my government since we came to office.

Death to all Islamic terrorists! Thank you.”\n\nLoomer said she had been informed by the US defense department – which the Trump administration calls the war department – that the American cruise missile strikes carried out with the Nigerian government’s cooperation had been “a direct response to [IS] jihadi terrorists killing Christians in Nigeria”.\n\nThe US House member Randy Fine, a Florida Republican who in November supported a congressional resolution calling for Nigeria to be designated a “country of particular concern” due to its religious violence, described Thursday’s strikes as an “amazing Christmas present!”\n\n“With Muslim terrorists attacking Christians in Nigeria, Syria, and even Europe – simply for refusing to submit to Islam – the president is showing that we will no longer tolerate these barbarians,” Fine said on X, after suggesting earlier in December that “mainstream Muslims” should be “destroyed”.\n\nThe uniformity of the Republicans’ response comes in contrast to a campaign involving economic pressure as well as airstrikes on alleged drug boats that the Trump administration is waging on Venezuela to oust its president, Nicolás Maduro. Some Republicans have warned that the history of US “regime change” efforts are not promising and have warned against direct military strikes on Venezuela.\n\nAttacks on Christians by Islamic extremist groups in Nigeria such as Boko Haram had been drawing increased attention from US Christian groups that are generally aligned with Trump.\n\n“Do not test President Trump‘s resolved [sic] in this matter,” said a post from the Republican US House member Riley Moore of West Virginia, who introduced the Nigeria-related congressional resolution in November. “Tonight’s strike in coordination with the Nigerian government is just the first step to ending the slaughter of Christians and the security crisis affecting all Nigerians.”\n\nIn further comments on Friday, other Republican lawmakers praised Trump for carrying out the strikes. North Carolina senator Ted Budd, a Republican, said that IS “is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Christians & religious minorities in Nigeria”.\n\nBudd wrote that Trump’s “decisive strikes will save lives & protect religious freedom. May God bless our brave men & women in uniform.”\n\nCongressman Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who recently led a delegation to Nigeria, said that attitudes within the Nigerian government were “beginning to turn in favor of protecting Christians – in addition to taking actions against those terrorizing Christians and moderate Muslims”.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said on X that he commended the Trump administration as well as American troops for “these strikes against bloodthirsty [IS] savages who are not only persecuting Christians, but also have killed many Americans”.\n\nPressure on the administration to act in Nigeria had been building since July, when the US Commission on International Religious Freedom issued an advisory that said the Nigerian government was “often unable to prevent or slow to react to violent attacks by Fulani herders, bandit gangs, and insurgent entities such as JAS/Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)”.\n\nIn October, Ted Cruz – a Republican senator from Texas – said the US was able to identify the perpetrators of anti-Christian violence in Nigeria “and I intend to hold them accountable”. Cruz said that since 2009, “over 50,000 Christians in Nigeria have been massacred, and over 18,000 churches and 2,000 Christian schools have been destroyed”.\n\nAt the recent AmericaFest, a four-day gathering of US conservative organized by Turning Point USA, the Trinidadian rap star Nicki Minaj spoke with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, on the oppression of Christians in Nigeria. She said she loved Nigeria in part because her pastor is Nigerian.\n\n“Hearing that people are being kidnapped – while they’re in church, people are being kidnapped, people are being killed, brutalized, all because of their religion – that should spark outrage in America, and that’s what it’s doing,” Minaj said.\n\nThursday’s strikes in Nigeria come less than a week after the US hit more than 70 Islamic State networks and infrastructure in Syria in response to an attack that killed two American military service members as well as a civilian.\n\nAdm Brad Cooper, commander of the American military’s Central Command (Centcom), said the Syrian strikes were “critical to preventing [IS] from inspiring terrorist plots and attacks against the US homeland”.\n\nHegseth on Friday warned of additional US strikes against IS targets in northern Nigeria.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:50:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T18:37:41.632250"}

Both sides have agreed to freeze all troop movements and allow civilians living in border areas to return home, halting weeks of intense border clashes that have killed at least 41 people and displaced almost a million people. The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT). Once it has held for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand will also be released, the statement said. The breakthrough came after Thai and Cambodian officials held several days of talks aimed at ending fresh fighting between the two countries.\n\nThe joint statement outlines the terms of \"de-escalation\", which includes ceasing \"attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side\". \"Both sides must avoid unprovoked firing or advancement or movement of troops towards the other side's positions or troops,\" the statement said. The statement also said that the release of the 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand would be conducted \"in the spirit of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration\", an agreement between the two countries signed at a ceremony attended by US President Donald Trump in October. That ceasefire agreement was broken earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides have since blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce. The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani Province, and a Thai solider had been killed. Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate. Clashes have continued throughout December.

He is the candidate for the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), backed by Myanmar's military, in Aungmyaythazan, a constituency in the city of Mandalay. The crowd of 300-400 clutch the branded hats and flags they've been given, but soon wilt in the afternoon heat, some dozing off. Children run and play in between the rows of chairs. Many of these families are victims of the earthquake which badly damaged Mandalay and surrounding areas in March, and are hoping for a handout. They disappear the moment the rally finishes.\n\nA 'sham' election\n\nOn Sunday the people of Myanmar get their first opportunity to vote in an election since the military seized power in a coup nearly five years ago, setting off a devastating civil war. But the poll, already delayed many times by the ruling junta, is being widely condemned as a sham. The most popular party, the National League for Democracy, has been dissolved, and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is locked up in an undisclosed prison. Voting, which will happen in three stages over a period of a month, will not even be possible in large parts of the country still consumed by war. Even where voting is taking place, it is marred by a climate of fear and intimidation.\n\nWhen the BBC tried asking people at the rally in Mandalay what they thought of the election, we were told not to by party officials. They might say the wrong thing, one man explained – they don't know how to speak to journalists. The number of plain-clothes military intelligence officers present there helps explain their nervousness. In a dictatorship which has criminalised liking Facebook pages criticising the election, or using the word revolution, even these staunchly pro-military party activists feared the consequences of allowing a foreign journalist the chance to ask uncensored questions. The same fear lingers on the streets of Mandalay. At a market stall selling fresh river fish the customers all refused to answer what they thought of the election. We have no choice, so we have to vote, one said. The fish seller shooed us away. \"You will bring me trouble,\" she said. Only one woman was brave enough to speak frankly, but we needed to find a private place to meet, and to conceal her identity, just to hear her view of the election. \"This election is a lie,\" she said. \"Everyone is afraid. Everyone has lost their humanity and their freedom. So many people have died, been tortured or fled to other countries. If the military keeps running the country, how can things change?\" She would not vote, she said, but she knew that decision carried risks.\n\nLulu Luo/ BBC Most people we encountered did not want to discuss the election\n\nThe military authorities imposed a new law in July criminalising \"any speech, organising, inciting, protesting, or distributing leaflets in order to destroy a part of the electoral process\". Earlier this month Tayzar San, a doctor and one of the first to organise a protest against the 2021 coup, was also among the first to be charged under the law, after he distributed leaflets calling for a boycott of the election. The junta has offered a reward for information leading to his arrest. In September three young people in Yangon were given sentences of 42 to 49 years each for posting stickers showing a bullet and a ballot box together.\n\nTayzar San/Facebook Tayzar San distributing leaflets boycotting the election\n\n\"Co-operate and crush all those harming the union,\" commands a large red poster looming over the families and couples enjoying a late afternoon stroll under the old red-brick walls of the royal palace in Mandalay. In this menacing climate anything approaching a free vote is unimaginable.\n\nA general's gambit\n\nYet the junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has a spring in his step these days. He seems confident this extraordinary election, where there will be no voting at all in as much as one half of the country, will give him the legitimacy he has failed to acquire during his five catastrophic years in power. He even attended a Christmas mass in Yangon's cathedral and condemned the \"hatred and resentment between individuals\" which led to \"domination, oppression, and violence in human communities\". This, from a man charged by the UN and human rights groups with genocide against Muslim Rohingyas, whose coup set off a civil war which, according to the data analysis group ACLED, has killed 90,000 people.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing\n\nMin Aung Hlaing's election gambit has the full diplomatic support of China, which, bizarrely for a one-party state, is giving technical and financial support for this multi-party exercise. It is likely to be reluctantly accepted in the rest of Asia too. His army, newly equipped with Chinese and Russian weapons, has been regaining ground lost over the past two years to the various armed groups opposing the coup. He is clearly hoping to include more reconquered territory in the third stage of the election at the end of January. With Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD out of the picture his USDP is all but guaranteed to win. In the last, free election in 2020, the USDP won only six percent of parliamentary seats. Some observers have noted that Min Aung Hlaing is not popular even within his own regime, or his own party, where his leadership qualities are questioned. He will probably keep the presidency after the election, but his power will, to some extent, be diluted by the resumption of parliamentary politics, albeit without most of the parties that won seats in the 2020 election. The election is clearly viewed by China as an off-ramp, a way for the military to get out of the destructive deadlock caused by its ill-judged coup.\n\n'No-one is ready to compromise'\n\nEven a short distance from the apparently peaceful city life of Mandalay, the deep scars left by Myanmar's civil war, which is still far from over, are visible. On the opposite side of the Irrawaddy River lies the spectacular temple complex at Mingun, once a popular tourist attraction. Getting there requires a short drive along a riverside road, but for the past four years this, like much of the area around Mandalay, has been contested territory, where volunteer People's Defence Forces control many villages and launch ambushes against army convoys. To reach Mingun we needed to get through several checkpoints. We sat in a tea shop with the local police commander to negotiate our passage. He was a young man, wearing the huge strain of his job on his face. He had a revolver stuck in the back of his trousers, and two even younger men – boys, perhaps - carrying military-issue assault rifles sat close by as his bodyguards.\n\nLulu Luo/ BBC Many young men have taken up arms on both sides of this conflict\n\nHe said he had to carry these weapons just to move about the village. On his phone were images of his opponents: young men, raggedly dressed, with an assortment of weapons they may have smuggled from border regions of Myanmar or obtained from dead soldiers and police officers. One group, calling itself the Unicorn Guerrilla Force, was his toughest adversary. They never negotiated, he said. \"If we see each other we always shoot. That's the way it is.\" The election, he added, would not be taking place in most of the villages to the north of him. \"Everyone here has taken sides in this conflict. It is so complicated and difficult. But no-one is ready to compromise.\" After an hour we were told it would be too dangerous to reach Mingun.

His actions triggered widespread protests and criticism from opposition groups and civil society, most of whom doubted his vow not to personally run for office.\n\nOn Sunday, 6.7 million eligible voters in Guinea will head to the ballot box for the first presidential election since the 2021 coup. Among the nine candidates are the former minister Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea and the former junta supporter turned critic Faya Millimono of the Liberal Bloc party.\n\nBut thanks to a controversial referendum in September that led to the adoption of a new constitution allowing him to run and extending presidential terms from five to seven years, the clear frontrunner is Doumbouya.\n\nThe opposition coalition Forces vives de Guinée has called his candidacy a betrayal. “The man who presented himself as the restorer of democracy chose to become its gravedigger,” it said in a statement last month after Doumbouya officially deposited his intent to run with the supreme court.\n\nPolitical upheavals have been a recurring feature in west Africa, a region that has earned the moniker of “coup belt” after seven successful coups and several unsuccessful attempts since 2020. While Guinea has remained under the Ecowas umbrella, fellow juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, angered by its post-coup sanctions, have split from the regional bloc to form the pro-Russian Alliance of Sahel States (AES). If it holds, the Guinean election will be the first in any of the junta-run states since 2020.\n\nView image in fullscreen A campaign billboard in Conakry of the Guinean presidential candidate Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea. Photograph: Souleymane Camara/Reuters\n\nWithin Guinea, many believe the general’s victory is a foregone conclusion, given his consolidation of power since ascending to the presidency and promoting himself to a general. Even now, the presidential race is notable not for those who are on the ballot, but for those who are not.\n\nThe biggest opposition parties remain suspended, and their most prominent leaders have been detained, barred from running or – like the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, are in exile. Many say a climate of fear pervades the country due to the junta’s crackdown against its critics, with several dissidents in jail.\n\nConversely, Doumbouya pardoned the former dictator Moussa Dadis Camara who was given a 20-year sentence for his role in one of Guinea’s most serious human rights atrocities: the 2009 massacre and mass rape of protesters at a stadium in Conakry. The pardon, granted before the final hearing, prompted several human rights groups to write a joint open letter to the junta leader alongside families of victims, urging him to reconsider. That process is now in limbo.\n\nAhead of the vote, Doumbouya has been accumulating goodwill.This month, the shiny new Simandou mine, which has the world’s largest untapped reserve of iron ore, was launched after nearly three decades of delays caused by political instability and corruption. Doumbouya’s government is touting the project as a bridge to prosperity for Guinea and a sign of incoming development, despite mass job losses and environmental complaints.\n\nThe election stakes are high: in the coming years, the multi-layered Simandou mine project – which also includes the construction of ports and a railway – is expected to transform the economy of Guinea, where half of the population lives on below $2 a day. Given existential concerns around transparency, many are waiting to see what the winning government does after the election.\n\n“Our salvation lies in a return to the [proper] constitutional order,” said Abdoulaye Koroma, a presidential candidate for the Rally for Renaissance and Development party.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 08:00:33 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T08:34:44.488389"}

Dologuélé was the runner-up in the last two elections – 2015 and 2020 – while Dondra briefly served under the president.\n\nThe opposition hopes to tap into the frustrations of people living in a country where conflict is a daily reality. More than half a million people remain internally displaced within CAR, with a similar number living as refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, Touadéra, a former mathematics professor who has been in power since 2016, is widely expected to extend his run in office.\n\nHe went from an academic to a statesman after the then-president, François Bozizé, appointed him prime minister in 2008. Touadéra stayed in that role until 2013, when the administration was toppled by a rebel coalition, as sectarian violence triggered a civil war.\n\nAfter a chaotic three-year transition, Touadéra ran for office, and the perception that he was neutral, independent of the ex-Séléka and anti-Balaka militias, powered his second-round victory.\n\nA peace accord was signed in April with the two main rebel groups, and there is hope the country might be slowly stabilising. There had been “tangible progress to establish peace”, said Lewis Mudge, the central Africa director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAbdou Abarry, the head of the UN regional 0ffice for central Africa (Unoca) agreed, although added there were still challenges. “This is an opportunity to commend the remarkable recovery of the country, which is laying the foundations for peace consolidation among domestic actors and has undertaken measures to secure its borders, notably with Chad and Cameroon,” he told the UN security council this month.\n\nStill, there are concerns that supply-chain issues and violence could disrupt the vote, especially in some rural areas. The UN peacekeeping mission Minusca, whose mandate was recently renewed until next year, is providing the security and logistical support the state’s crumbling infrastructure cannot manage.\n\nThere are claims the voter list was only published online, and not physically, even though most people have no internet access or electricity. The electoral issues have led to a band of opposition politicians announcing a boycott.\n\nAccording to Mudge, the irregularities could “disenfranchise large segments of the population” and undercut the integrity of the process.\n\nMany people worry that another Touadéra term – a 2023 constitutional referendum not only scrapped term limits but extended presidential mandates from five to seven years – would mean more free roaming for outside interests.\n\nAfter taking office, Touadéra put faith in the Russian mercenary firm Wagner, which provides part of his private security, while Minusca and Rwandan troops helped secure the countryside. Since its arrival in 2018, Wagner’s influence within CAR has grown such that despite the founder Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death, Touadéra has resisted Moscow’s calls to integrate the military contractors within Africa Corps, its successor entity.\n\nRwanda, where the government often mentions the need for “African solutions to African problems”, has taken a different approach from Russia, focusing on smaller business interests in CAR.\n\nIn August, a pro-opposition media outlet claimed the government had evicted its own soldiers from a World Bank-funded youth training centre in Nzila, a village on the outskirts of the capital, Bangui, to clear the way for Rwandan troops to engage in a large livestock farming operation.\n\n“Touadéra is determined to sell off the country piece by piece and sacrifice the youth of the Central African Republic,” the editorial read.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T05:30:45.412106"}

The military government is holding a phased ballot nearly five years after it seized power in a coup, which sparked widespread opposition and spiralled into a civil war. Observers say the junta, with China's support, is seeking to legitimise and entrench its power as it seeks a way out of the devastating stalemate. More than 200 people have been charged for disrupting or opposing the polls under a new law which carries severe punishments, including the death penalty.\n\nPolling began on Sunday after reports of explosions in at least two regions of Myanmar. Three people were taken to hospital following a rocket attack on an uninhabited house in the Mandalay region in the early hours of Sunday, the chief minister of the region confirmed to the BBC. One of those people is in a serious condition. Separately, more than ten houses were damaged in the Myawaddy township, near the border with Thailand, following a series of explosions late on Saturday. A local resident told the BBC that a child was killed in the attack, and three people were taken to hospital in an emergency condition. Voters have told the BBC that the election feels more \"disciplined and systematic\" than those previously. \"The experience of voting has changed a lot,\" said Ma Su ZarChi, who lives in the Mandalay region. \"Before I voted, I was afraid. Now that I have voted, I feel relieved. I cast my ballot as someone who has tried their best for the country.\" First-time voter Ei Pyay Phyo Maung, 22, told the BBC she was casting her ballot because she believed that voting is \"the responsibility of every citizen\". \"My hope is for the lower classes - right now, the prices of goods are skyrocketing, and I want to support someone who can bring them down for those struggling the most,\" she said. \"I want a president who provides equally for all people.\"\n\nThe Burmese junta has rejected criticism of the polls, maintaining that it aims to \"return [the country] to a multi-party democratic system\". After casting his vote at a highly fortified polling station in the capital, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing told the BBC that the election would be free and fair. \"I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, a civil servant. I can't just say that I want to be president,\" he said, stressing that there are three phases of the election. Earlier this week, he warned that those who refuse to vote are rejecting \"progress toward democracy\".\n\nWin Kyaw Thu/BBC Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing cast his ballot in the capital Nay Pyi Taw\n\nFilm director Mike Tee, actor Kyaw Win Htut and comedian Ohn Daing were among the prominent figures convicted under the law against disrupting polls, which was enacted in July.

Civilians are \"being coerced from all sides\", Mr Türk said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that armed rebel groups have issued their own threats asking people to boycott the polls. The military has been fighting on several fronts, against both armed resistance groups who oppose the coup, as well as ethnic armies which have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year following relentless airstrikes enabled by support from China and Russia.

On screen, she was a French cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality. One publication called her \"the princess of pout and the countess of come hither\", but it was an image she grew to loathe. Ruthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress. Eventually, she abandoned her career to campaign for animal welfare. Years later, her reputation was damaged when she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred. Her son also sued her for emotional damage after she said she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\". It was a scar on the memory of an icon, who - in her prime - put the bikini, female desire, and French cinema on the map.\n\nLido/Shutterstock Bardot helped to make the bikini socially acceptable in the 1950s\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris on 28 September 1934. She and her sister, Marie-Jeanne, grew up in a luxurious apartment in the plushest district of the city. Her Catholic parents were wealthy and pious, and demanded high standards of their children. The girls' friendships were closely policed. When they broke their parent's favourite vase, they were whipped as a punishment.\n\nRoger Viollet via Getty Images Her parents wanted Brigitte Bardot to become a ballet dancer\n\nWith German troops occupying Paris during World War II, Bardot spent most of her time at home, dancing to records. Her mother encouraged her interest and enrolled her in ballet classes from the age of seven. Her teacher at the Paris Conservatoire described her as an outstanding pupil, and she went on to win awards.\n\nLife as a 'jeune fille'\n\nBut Bardot found life claustrophobic. By the age of 15, she later recalled, \"I was seeking something, perhaps a fulfilment of myself.\" A family friend persuaded her to pose for the cover of Elle, the leading women's magazine in France, and the photographs caused a sensation.\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images Brigitte Bardot's early magazine covers redefined fashion and the concept of beauty\n\nAt the time, fashionable women had short hair, carefully matched their accessories, and sported tailored jackets and silky evening wear. Brigitte's hair flowed around her shoulders. With the lithe, athletic body of the ballerina, she was nothing like her fellow models. Pictured in a series of young, modish outfits, she became the personification of a new \"jeune fille\" (young girl) style. At the age of 16, she found herself the most famous cover girl in Paris. Her pictures caught the attention of the film director Marc Allegret, who instructed his assistant, Roger Vadim, to track her down.\n\nQUINIO/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was infatuated with aspiring director Roger Vadim\n\nThe screen tests were not successful, but Vadim - who was six years older - took her on, first as his protégé and then as his fiancée. They began an intense affair, but when Bardot's parents found out, they threatened to send her away to England.\n\nS.N. Pathe Cinema/Getty Images Roger Vadim helped his teenage wife launch her film career\n\nRoger Vadim, her 'wild wolf'\n\nIn retaliation, she attempted to take her own life, but was discovered and stopped just in time. Brigitte was infatuated with the aspiring director. He seemed to her as a \"wild wolf\". \"He looked at me, scared me, attracted me, and I didn't know where I was anymore,\" she later explained.\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images Bardot and Vadim on their wedding day at the Church of Passy, Paris, 12 December 1952. Vadim sold the pictures of the ceremony to Paris-Match\n\nUnder such pressure, her parents relented, but forbade the couple from marrying until Brigitte was 18. As soon as that milestone was passed, the couple walked down the aisle.\n\nBecoming an icon\n\nVadim began to mould Bardot into the star that he believed she could be. He sold the pictures of their wedding to Paris-Match and instructed her in how to perform in public. He helped his new wife find small roles in a dozen minor films, often playing pouty-yet-innocent female love interests. But, until 1956, she was chiefly famous for posing in bikinis - until then a garment banned in Spain, Italy and much of America for being on the razor edge of decency - and popularising a beehive hairdo. Then came peroxide, and the part that made her a star. That year, Vadim's debut film, And God Created Woman, opened in Paris. It failed to make money in France, but caused uproar in the United States.\n\nMarka/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Bardot created uproar in And God Created Woman\n\nIn a country used to Doris Day, Bardot was a sensation. Her character pursues her sexual appetites, without shame, as men do. She dances barefoot in a trance, her skin glowing with sweat, with her hair worn wild and loose. Her lack of inhibition causes social order to collapse; outside the cinema, the reaction was just as intense. The existentialist Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\" - raising Brigitte to the status of a philosophy. But the American moral majority mobilised. The film was banned in some states, and newspapers denounced its depravity. To audiences, Bardot became indistinguishable from the character she played. Paris-Match branded her \"immoral from head to toe\". And when Bardot ran off with her co-star, Jean-Louis Trintignant, her image as a wanton libertine was inescapable.\n\nAtlantis Films/Pictorial Parade/Courtesy of Getty Images Existentialist philosophers hailed Bardot as an icon of \"absolute freedom\"\n\nShe divorced Vadim, who reacted as only a Frenchman could. \"I prefer to have that kind of wife,\" he said, \"knowing she is unfaithful, rather than possess a woman who just loved me and no-one else.\" He went on to work with Bardot again, and later live with Catherine Deneuve and marry Jane Fonda.\n\nA reluctant mother\n\nIn 1959, Brigitte - after several love affairs - married the actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she starred in Babette Goes To War. The couple had a son, Nicolas, but Bardot resented her pregnancy: repeatedly punching herself in the stomach and begging a doctor for morphine to induce a miscarriage. \"I looked at my flat, slender belly in the mirror like a dear friend upon whom I was about to close a coffin lid,\" she later recalled.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Bardot resented her pregnancy and was later sued by her son for emotional damage\n\nAfter the inevitable divorce, Nicolas did not see his mother for decades. He sued Bardot for emotional damage when she published an autobiography in which she stated that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\". Brigitte was now the highest paid actress in France, with some suggesting that she was more valuable in terms of foreign trade than the country's car industry. But she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress. \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\" She began to attract the attention of Europe's most respected film-makers, winning critical acclaim in Jean-Luc Godard's powerful, New Wave drama, Le Mépris (Contempt). But the overall quality of her output was mixed, especially when she ventured outside France and into Hollywood. A third marriage, to a millionaire German playboy, was followed by a string of lovers - although, uncharacteristically, she did reject Sean Connery.\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images Bardot grew tired of her sex kitten image and quit acting to campaign for animal welfare. \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\"\n\nShe made dozens of records, alongside Serge Gainsbourg and Sacha Distel. With Gainsbourg, she recorded the raunchy Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus, although she begged him not to release it. A year later, he re-recorded the song with the British actress, Jane Birkin. It became a huge hit all over Europe, with Bardot's version remaining under wraps for 20 years.\n\nAnimal rights campaigner\n\nAfter nearly 50 films, she announced she was retiring to devote her life to animal welfare in 1973. \"I gave my beauty and my youth to men\", she said. \"I'm going to give my wisdom and experience to animals\".\n\nPhilippe Caron/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nShe raised 3m francs (then about £300,000) to establish the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, by auctioning off her jewellery and film memorabilia. Bardot - or B.B. as she was known in France - campaigned against the annual seal cull in Canada, and irritated some of her countrymen by condemning the eating of horse meat. She became a vegetarian, attacked the Chinese government for \"torturing\" bears, and spent hundreds of thousands on a programme to sterilise Romanian stray dogs.\n\nSygma via Getty Images Bardot campaigned against the culling of seals and the fur trade, among other issues\n\nA troubled end to a troubled life\n\nIn her later years, she was prosecuted on multiple occasions for racial hatred. She objected to the way the Islamic and Jewish faiths slaughter animals for food. But the way she voiced her criticism was unforgivable, and - indeed - illegal. In 1999, she wrote that \"my homeland is invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims\". This landed Bardot with a huge fine. She went on to criticise interracial marriages and insult gay men who, in her words, \"jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air, and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through\". Bardot was in court so often that, in 2008, the prosecutor declared that he was \"weary\" of charging her.\n\nGilles BASSIGNAC/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was in court so often that the prosecutor said he was \"weary\" of charging her", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:18:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T10:27:02.614782"}

The cinema icon - BB as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare. Paying tribute, President Emmanuel Macron said France is mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\". Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.\n\nIn a statement, the animal welfare foundation she established said it was announcing her death with \"immense sadness\". The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said she was \"a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation.\" It did not specify where or when Bardot died. In a tribute on social media, President Macron wrote: \"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. \"French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.\" Another who paid tribute was French far-right politician Marine Le Pen: \"France loses an exceptional woman, through her talent, her courage, her frankness, her beauty.\" Bardot's husband, whom she married in 1992, was Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the late far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen - the father of Marine.\n\nHerbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty Images Bardot tore up the rule book of French cinema in the 1950s\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris in 1934 to a wealthy family, who wanted her to become a ballerina. She was discovered in her teens after posing on the cover of Elle magazine, swiftly becoming a sensation in her home country, and was persuaded to enter the cinema world. She played iconic roles, the most notable in the 1956 film And God Created Woman, directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim, in which she played a sexually liberated woman. The film scandalised the American public and was banned in some US states, while the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\".\n\nThrough the late 1950s and 1960s, she became a global phenomenon with roles in The Truth, earning critical acclaim for her dramatic depth; Contempt, a Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece; and Viva Maria!, showcasing her comedic flair alongside Jeanne Moreau. Beyond her most iconic roles, Bardot showcased her versatility in films like Love on a Pillow, where she portrayed a complex, emotionally-torn character, and Two Weeks in September, a romantic drama that highlighted her ability to convey vulnerability. In The Bear and the Doll, she brought playful charm to a comedic role, proving her range across genres. These films, though less celebrated, underscored her ability to captivate audiences in diverse narratives. As well as her work in film, Bardot will also be remembered as a fashion icon, with her blonde tousled hair and bold eyeliner setting beauty trends worldwide. After wearing an off-the-shoulder number in Cannes in 1953, similar styles became known as the Bardot neckline. She was married four times and had one son, Nicolas, with French actor and film producer Jacques Charrier, who died in September. Nicolas later sued his mother for emotional damage after she wrote in an autobiography that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\".\n\nKeystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images Bardot, Jacques Charrier and their three-day-old son Nicolas in 1960\n\nRuthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress. At the height of her fame, she announced she was retiring at the age of 39 to devote her life to animal welfare. \"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals,\" Bardot famously declared. In 1986, she launched the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which works to protect wild and domestic animals. She became a vegetarian, and in 2013 even threatened to apply for Russian citizenship in protest against plans to kill two sick elephants in a French zoo. Reacting to her death, France's oldest animal protection association - The Société Protectrice des Animaux - paid tribute to an \"iconic and passionate figure for the animal cause\".\n\nCharly Hel/Prestige/Getty Images Bardot, pictured here in 2001, became an increasingly controversial figure in her later life", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:34:26 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T14:24:54.688115"}

This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nIt is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.\n\nKurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.\n\nArben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.\n\nThere is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.\n\nRepairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.\n\nThe EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.\n\nThe fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.\n\nOne analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power.\n\nBut he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:27:02 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T02:22:43.143033"}

The army, navy, air force and rocket force would be dispatched for the drills scheduled for Tuesday, which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said. Codenamed \"Justice Mission 2025\", the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms. Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.\n\nTaiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms. Taiwan's defence ministry said that they detected Chinese aircraft and ships around Taiwan on Monday morning, and have deployed their own forces and missile systems to monitor the situation. Its forces are on \"high alert\" to defend Taiwan and \"protect our people\", the ministry said. In a post on Weibo, the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command - in charge of the Taiwan Strait - described the upcoming military exercise as a \"shield of justice\". \"All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield!\" the post read. While China has long called for the \"peaceful reunification\" with Taiwan, it also has a law stating it will resort to \"non-peaceful means\" to prevent the island's \"secession\". Beijing has accused Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te of pursuing \"Taiwan independence\". The president maintains Taiwan is already a sovereign nation and therefore has no need to formally declare independence. On Sunday, Lai said in a local television interview that Taiwan needed to \"keep raising the difficulty so [China] can never meet the standard\" for an invasion. He also said that his administration was committed to \"maintaining the status quo\" and would not provoke China - though he added that peace relies on \"real strength\". Polls consistently show that most Taiwanese people want the \"status quo\", meaning they neither want to unify with China, nor to formally declare independence.\n\nCCTV Chinese state media published a map released by the military showing Tuesday's drill locations around Taiwan\n\nSince 2022 Beijing has ramped up military drills in the Taiwan Strait, usually in response to what it deems as threats such as former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and Lai's inauguration in 2024. China's last live-fire exercise in the Taiwan Strait, held in April, simulated strikes on key ports and energy facilities, the People's Liberation Army said at the time. Along with the drills, the Chinese military released a series of cartoons depicting Lai as a \"parasite\". This week's military drills are the first to be held under Yang Zhibin, the new chief of the Eastern Theater Command who assumed his role in October. Taiwan holds military exercises of its own, both to prepare its population for an attack and showcase its defences to Beijing. This year's Han Kuang exercise, which took place over 10 days, was the largest and longest one yet. Since taking office, Lai has vowed to boost defence spending and enhance the island's defence capabilities in the face of increasing tensions with Beijing.

I watched the Cold War reach its height, then simply evaporate. But I've never seen a year quite as worrying as 2025 has been - not just because several major conflicts are raging but because it is becoming clear that one of them has geopolitical implications of unparalleled importance. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the current conflict in his country could escalate into a world war. After nearly 60 years of observing conflict, I've got a nasty feeling he's right.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Ukraine's President has warned that the current conflict in Ukraine could escalate into a world war\n\nNato governments are on high alert for any signs that Russia is cutting the undersea cables that carry the electronic traffic that keeps Western society going. Their drones are accused of testing the defences of Nato countries. Their hackers develop ways of putting ministries, emergency services and huge corporations out of operation. Authorities in the west are certain Russia's secret services murder and attempt to murder dissidents who have taken refuge in the West. An inquiry into the attempted murder in Salisbury of the former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skrypal in 2018 (plus the actual fatal poisoning of a local woman, Dawn Sturgess) concluded that the attack had been agreed at the highest level in Russia. That means President Putin himself.\n\nThis time feels different\n\nThe year 2025 has been marked by three very different wars. There is Ukraine of course, where the UN says 14,000 civilians have died. In Gaza, where Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu promised \"mighty vengeance\" after about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 and 251 people were taken hostage. Since then, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action, including more than 30,000 women and children according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry – figures the UN considers reliable. Meanwhile there has been a ferocious civil war between two military factions in Sudan. More than 150,000 people have been killed there over the past couple of years; around 12 million have been forced out of their homes. Maybe, if this had been the only war in 2025, the outside world would have done more to stop it; but it wasn't. \"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump, as his aircraft flew him to Israel after he had negotiated a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting. It's true that fewer people are dying in Gaza now. Despite the ceasefire, the Gaza war certainly doesn't feel as though it's been solved. Given the appalling suffering in the Middle East it may sound strange to say the war in Ukraine is on a completely different level to this. But it is.\n\nAFP via Getty Images \"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump\n\nThe Cold War aside, most of the conflicts I've covered over the years have been small-scale affairs: nasty and dangerous, certainly, but not serious enough to threaten the peace of the entire world. Some conflicts, such as Vietnam, the first Gulf War, and the war in Kosovo, did occasionally look as though they might tip over into something much worse, but they never did. The great powers were too nervous about the dangers that a localised, conventional war might turn into a nuclear one. \"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,\" the British Gen Sir Mike Jackson reportedly shouted over his radio in Kosovo in 1999, when his Nato superior ordered British and French forces to seize an airfield in Pristina after the Russian troops had got there first. In the coming year, 2026, though, Russia, noting President Trump's apparent lack of interest in Europe, seems ready and willing to push for much greater dominance. Earlier this month, Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to. At a later televised event he said: \"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours\".\n\nGetty Images Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to\n\nBut already Russia, a major world power, has invaded an independent European country, resulting in huge numbers of civilian and also military deaths. It is accused by Ukraine of kidnapping at least 20,000 children. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his involvement in this, something Russia has always denied. Russia says it invaded in order to protect itself against Nato encroachment, but President Putin has indicated another motive: the desire to restore Russia's regional sphere of influence.\n\nAmerican disapproval\n\nHe is gratefully aware that this last year, 2025, has seen something most Western countries had regarded as unthinkable: the possibility that an American president might turn his back on the strategic system which has been in force ever since World War Two. Not only is Washington now uncertain it wants to protect Europe, it disapproves of the direction it believes Europe is heading in. The Trump administration's new national security strategy report claims Europe now faces the \"stark prospect of civilisational erasure\". The Kremlin welcomed the report, saying it is consistent with Russia's own vision. You bet it is. Inside Russia, Putin has silenced most internal opposition to himself and to the Ukraine war, according to the UN special rapporteur focusing on human rights in Russia. He's got his own problems, though: the possibility of inflation rising again after a recent cooling, oil revenues falling, and his government having had to raise VAT to help pay for the war.\n\nGetty Images US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky clashed during a meeting at the White House in February 2025\n\nThe economies of the European Union are 10 times bigger than Russia's; even more than that if you add the UK. The combined European population of 450 million, is over three times Russia's 145 million. Still, Western Europe has seemed nervous of losing its creature comforts, and was until recently reluctant to pay for its own defence as long as America can be persuaded to protect it. America, too, is different nowadays: less influential, more inward-looking, and increasingly different from the America I've reported on for my entire career. Now, very much as in the 1920s and 30s, it wants to concentrate on its own national interests. Even if President Trump loses a lot of his political strength at next year's mid-term elections, he may have shifted the dial so far towards isolationism that even a more Nato-minded American president in 2028 might find it hard to come to Europe's aid. Don't think Vladimir Putin hasn't noticed that.\n\nThe risk of escalation\n\nThe coming year, 2026, does look as though it'll be important. Zelensky may well feel obliged to agree to a peace deal, carving off a large part of Ukrainian territory. Will there be enough bankable guarantees to stop President Putin coming back for more in a few years' time? For Ukraine and its European supporters, already feeling that they are at war with Russia, that's an important question. Europe will have to take over a far greater share of keeping Ukraine going, but if the United States turns its back on Ukraine, as it sometimes threatens to do, that will be a colossal burden.\n\nGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty Images If the United States turns its back on Ukraine, that will be a colossal burden for Europe\n\nBut could the war turn into a nuclear confrontation? We know President Putin is a gambler; a more careful leader would have shied away from invading Ukraine in February 2022. His henchmen make bloodcurdling threats about wiping the UK and other European countries off the map with Russia's vaunted new weapons, but he's usually much more restrained himself. While the Americans are still active members of Nato, the risk that they could respond with a devastating nuclear attack of their own is still too great. For now.\n\nChina's global role\n\nAs for China, President Xi Jinping has made few outright threats against the self-governed island of Taiwan recently. But two years ago the then director of the CIA William Burns said Xi Jinping had ordered the People's Liberation Army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. If China doesn't take some sort of decisive action to claim Taiwan, Xi Jinping could consider this to look pretty feeble. He won't want that. You might think that China is too strong and wealthy nowadays to worry about domestic public opinion. Not so. Ever since the uprising against Deng Xiaoping in 1989, which ended with the Tiananmen massacre, Chinese leaders have monitored the way the country reacts with obsessive care. I watched the events unfold in Tiananmen myself, reporting and even sometimes living in the Square.\n\nAFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool President Xi Jinping (centre) has made few outright threats against Taiwan recently\n\nThe story of 4 June 1989 wasn't as simple as we thought at the time: armed soldiers shooting down unarmed students. That certainly happened, but there was another battle going on in Beijing and many other Chinese cities. Thousands of ordinary working-class people came out onto the streets, determined to use the attack on the students as a chance to overthrow the control of the Chinese Communist Party altogether. When I drove through the streets two days later, I saw at least five police stations and three local security police headquarters burned out. In one suburb the angry crowd had set fire to a policeman and propped up his charred body against a wall. A uniform cap was put at a jaunty angle on his head, and a cigarette had been stuck between his blackened lips. It turns out the army wasn't just putting down a long-standing demonstration by students, it was stamping out a popular uprising by ordinary Chinese people. China's political leadership, still unable to bury the memories of what happened 36 years ago, is constantly on the look-out for signs of opposition - whether from organised groups like Falun Gong or the independent Christian church or the democracy movement in Hong Kong, or just people demonstrating against local corruption. All are stamped on with great force. I have spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989, watching its rise to economic and political dominance. I even came to know a top politician who was Xi Jinping's rival and competitor. His name was Bo Xilai, and he was an anglophile who spoke surprisingly openly about China's politics. He once said to me, \"You'll never understand how insecure a government feels when it knows it hasn't been elected.\" As for Bo Xilai, he was jailed for life in 2013 after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.\n\nJohn Simpson has spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989 (pictured in Tiananmen Square, 2016)\n\nAltogether, then, 2026 looks like being an important year. China's strength will grow, and its strategy for taking over Taiwan - Xi Jinping's great ambition - will become clearer. It may be that the war in Ukraine will be settled, but on terms that are favourable to President Putin. He may be free to come back for more Ukrainian territory when he's ready. And President Trump, even though his political wings could be clipped in November's mid-term elections, will distance the US from Europe even more. From the European point of view, the outlook could scarcely be more gloomy. If you thought World War Three would be a shooting-match with nuclear weapons, think again. It's much more likely to be a collection of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, which will see autocracy flourish. It could even threaten to break up the Western alliance. And the process has already started.

While both the US and Ukrainian presidents described the talks as \"great\", Trump reiterated that a key sticking point was the question of territory. Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine hand over more land. Addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky said they had come to an agreement on \"90%\" of a 20-point peace plan, while Trump said a security guarantee for Ukraine was \"close to 95%\" done. Zelensky later said US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week for further talks on issues aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nReuters\n\n\"We had a substantive conversation on all issues and highly value the progress that the Ukrainian and American teams have made over the past weeks,\" Zelensky said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. A proposal to turn the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Russia largely controls, into a demilitarised zone remains \"unresolved\", Trump said. \"Some of that land has been taken,\" he told reporters after the meeting. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months.\" Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas. Russia wants Ukraine to pull back from the small part of the territory it still controls in Donbas, while Kyiv has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by Ukrainian forces. The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back. He later reversed course. \"[That] is a very tough issue,\" he said. \"One that will get resolved.\" Security guarantees for Ukraine are \"95% done\", Trump said, without formally committing to logistical support or troop deployment to help protect Ukraine from future attacks. Trump floated the possibility of trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine, saying it could happen \"at the right time\". While the US president is keen to add the Ukraine-Russia war to the list of conflicts he claims to have ended, he cautioned that stalled or scrapped talks that go \"really badly\" could mean that the war continues.\n\nTrump: Agreement on Donbas 'unresolved' but 'getting closer'", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 02:06:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T06:50:56.089553"}

That is how it is for Ahmed, 18. He emerges from a mosque in the heart of Gaziantep in south-east Turkey - not far from the Syrian border - wearing a black T-shirt with \"Syria\" written on the front. His family fled his homeland when he was five years old, but he is planning to go back in a year or two at most. \"I am impatient to get there,\" he tells me. \"I am trying to save money first, because wages in Syria are low.\" Still, he insists the future will be better there. \"Syria will be rebuilt and it will be like gold,\" he says.\n\nIf he goes back, he will be following in the footsteps of more than half a million Syrians who have left Turkey since the ousting of Syria's long-time dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in December 2024. Many had been here since 2011, when civil war began devouring their country. In the years that followed, Turkey became a safe haven, taking in more Syrians than any other country. The number reached 3.5 million at its peak, causing political tension and - on occasion - xenophobic attacks. Officially, no Syrian will be forced to go, but some feel they are being pushed - by bureaucratic changes, and by a waning welcome. Civil society organisations \"are getting the message from the authorities that it's time to go\", says a Syrian woman who did not want to be named. \"I have a lot of good Turkish friends. Even they and my neighbours have asked why I am still here. Of course we will go back, but in an organised way. If we all go back together, it will be chaos.\"\n\nGetty Images Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December 2024\n\nAya Mustafa, 32, is eager to leave - but not yet. We meet under a winter sun by the stone walls of a castle, which has towered over Gaziantep since the Byzantine era. Her hometown, Aleppo, is less than two hours' drive away. She says going back is a constant topic of conversation in the Syrian community. \"Every day, every hour, we speak about this point,\" says Aya, whose family were lawyers and teachers back home, but had to start again in Turkey, baking and hairdressing to earn a living. \"We are talking about how we can return, and when, and what we can do. But there are many challenges, to be honest. Many families have children who were born here and can't even speak Arabic.\" Then there is the level of destruction in new Syria - where war has done its worst - and where the interim president, Ahmed Al Sharaa, is a former senior leader of Al Qaeda who has worked to reinvent his image. Aya saw the ruins of Aleppo for herself when she went back to visit. Her family home is still standing but now occupied by someone else. \"It's a big decision to go back to Syria,\" she says, \"especially for people with elderly relatives. I have my grandmother and my disabled sister. We need the basics like electricity and water and jobs to survive there.\" For now, she says, her family can't survive in Syria, but they will return in time. \"We believe that day will come,\" she says, with a broad smile. \"It will take some years [to rebuild]. But in the end, we will see everyone in Syria.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Syria's interim President, Ahmed Al Sharaa, is a former leader of Al Qaeda who has worked to reinvent his image\n\nA short drive away, we get a very different view from a Syrian family of four - father, mother and two teenage sons. The father - who does not want to be named - runs an aid organisation helping his fellow countrymen. Over glasses of tea and helpings of baklava, I ask if he and his family would move back. His response is swift and adamant. \"No, not for me and for my family,\" he says. \"And the same goes for my organisation. We have projects inside Syria, and we hope to extend that activity. But my family and my organisation will stay here in Turkey.\" Asked why, he lists problems with the economy, security, education and the health system. Syria's interim government \"hasn't any experience to deal with the situation\", he tells me. \"Some ask us to give them a chance, but one year has passed and the indications are not good.\" He too has visited the new Syria, and, like Aya, was not reassured. \"The security situation is very bad,\" he says. \"Every day there are killings. Regardless of who the victims are, they have souls.\" His voice softens when he speaks of his 80-year-old father in Damascus, who hasn't seen his grandsons for 12 years, and may never see them again. For now, he and his family can remain in Turkey, but he's already making contingency plans in case government policy changes. \"Plan A is that we will stay here in Turkey,\" he says. \"If we cannot, I'm thinking about plan B, C and even D. I am an engineer, always planning.\" None of those plans involve a return to Syria.\n\nIf going home is hard, staying in Turkey isn't easy either. Syrians have \"temporary protection\" that comes with restrictions. They are not supposed to leave the cities where they are first registered. Work permits are hard to get, and many are in low paid jobs, living on the margins. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who backed the uprising against Assad - has insisted that no Syrian will be driven out, but refugee advocates say there are growing pressures beneath the surface. They point to the ending of free medical care for Syrians from January, and new government regulations which make it more expensive to hire them. \"These new elements cast a shadow over how voluntary returns are,\" says Metin Corabatir, who heads an independent Turkish research centre on asylum and migration, IGAM. And he says presidential and parliamentary elections – due by 2028 – may be another threat for Syrians here. \"Normally President Erdogan is their main protector,\" Mr Corabatir tells me. \"He says they can stay as long as they want. And he repeated this after the regime changed. But if there is an election, and a political gain for the AKP [ruling party] to make, there might be some policy changes.\"\n\nGetty Images More than half a million Syrians have left Turkey since the ousting of Assad", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:05:53 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T06:50:56.249882"}

Any decisions made could have a potentially momentous impact on questions that determine the future of the region. The US has been Israel's strongest military and political backer throughout two years of war in Gaza and many are now looking to the meeting as a test of the leaders' relationship and how aligned they are on key topics. It will be their sixth meeting since Trump's return to office 11 months ago.\n\nAmong the expected points of discussion is the future of relations with Syria's new government, Iranian rearmament, and Hezbollah's role in Lebanon. Perhaps most critically, they will discuss progress of the Gaza ceasefire deal, where Israel's government has taken several positions diverging from those of the US government.\n\nThe talks will take place as storms continue to lash Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians remain living in basic tents that offer little protection from the cold and flooding. On Monday, the death of a two-month-old baby due to the severe cold was reported by the Hamas-run health ministry, bringing the total killed by the wintry weather since 10 December to three, while another 17 people have been killed by damaged buildings collapsing in the storms. The UN and numerous aid agencies have accused Israel of not meeting its ceasefire obligations by continuing to restrict full access to basic supplies and equipment. Israel has said it is meeting its obligations in facilitating an increase in aid deliveries. The Trump administration wants to see the ceasefire progress to its second phase in January, whereby a Palestinian technocratic government would be established alongside the deployment of an international security force, Hamas would disarm, Israeli troops would withdraw, and the reconstruction of the devastated territory would begin. Critics have suggested that Netanyahu may instead seek to delay the progress of the ceasefire, saying he does not want to engage seriously with questions of a political future for Palestinians and will instead push for Hamas to fully disarm before Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. Hamas officials have repeatedly said that its full disarmament should take place alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state. The 20-point peace plan promoted by Trump and signed by both Israel and Hamas recognises Palestinian aspirations to a sovereign state, however Netanyahu and his ministers have consistently rejected Palestinian statehood since the ceasefire came into effect in October. Last week, Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country would build settlements in Gaza and would \"never fully withdraw\" from the territory even if Hamas disarms, despite this being a key tenet of the ceasefire deal.\n\nReuters Recent winter weather in Gaza has reportedly caused 20 deaths due to the collapse of damaged buildings or exposure to cold", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:52:16 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:28.384765"}

We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace.\" In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems. He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack. \"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised,\" he said. But he added that Russia does not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported. The claim by Moscow comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war. Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done. Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.

But $2 billion is just a fraction of what the US has traditionally spent on aid. In 2022 its contribution to the UN's humanitarian work was estimated at $17 billion (£12.6bn).\n\nIt comes amid huge cuts in US funding for humanitarian operations, and further cuts expected from other donors, such as the UK and Germany.\n\nThe announcement was made in Geneva by Jeremy Lewin, President Trump's Under Secretary for Foreign Assistance, and the UN's emergency relief chief, Tom Fletcher.\n\nThe United States has pledged $2 billion (£1.5bn) to fund United Nations (UN) humanitarian programmes, but has warned the UN it must \"adapt or die\".\n\nAnd the funding comes with some strings attached. Although UN donors do sometimes earmark specific projects, the UN funding prioritises just 17 countries, among them Haiti, Syria, and Sudan.\n\nAfghanistan and Yemen will not, Mr Lewin said, receive any money, adding that Washington had evidence that in Afghanistan UN funds were being diverted to the Taliban and that \"President Trump will never tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money going to terrorist groups\".\n\nSuch restrictions will be hard for aid agencies working in countries not on the list. The impact of funding cuts has already led to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Afghanistan, and reductions in food rations for displaced people in Sudan. Globally, child mortality, which has been declining, is set to rise this year.\n\nThe conditions placed on the new US funding also rule out spending money on projects related to tackling climate change, which Mr Lewin said were not \"life saving\", and not in \"the US interest\".\n\nMr Lewin, a Trump loyalist who reportedly masterminded the shutdown of USAID and the firing of its thousands of staff, warned the UN that it must \"adapt or die\", saying that the US \"piggy bank is not open to those organisations that just want to return to the old system\".\n\nThe US says funding must be focused and efficient, with no duplication among aid projects. These are qualities Tom Fletcher, and the entire UN system, say they wholeheartedly support. It's in no one's interests, least of all those of the estimated 200 people caught up in crises, for money to be spent unwisely.\n\nBut while the UN is gratefully welcoming the new US funding, there remain big questions about whether the conditions around it are too politicised. The fundamental principles of humanitarian aid are that it should be neutral, impartial, and directed at those most in need. Eliminating specific countries, or specific crises such as climate change, challenges those principles.\n\nBut, as it struggles with a continued funding crises, and, in Washington, a very skeptical donor, many in the UN will be acknowledging that $2 billion is better than nothing.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:51:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T18:38:17.726372"}

Climbers had been required to pay a deposit of $4,000 (£2964), which they would only get back if they brought at least 8kg (18lbs) of waste back down with them. It was hoped it would begin to tackle the rubbish problem on the world's highest peak, which is estimated to be covered in some 50 tonnes of waste. But after 11 years - and with the rubbish still piling up - the scheme is being shelved because it \"failed to show a tangible result\".\n\nDavid Liano Clean-up campaigns have usually focused on lower camps of Mt Everest as it is difficult and costly to operate at higher altitudes\n\nHimal Gautam, director at the tourism department, told the BBC that not only had the garbage issue \"not gone away\", but the deposit scheme itself had \"become an administrative burden\". Tourism ministry and mountaineering department officials told the BBC most of the deposit money had been refunded over the years - which should mean most climbers brought back their trash. But the scheme is said to have failed because the rubbish climbers have brought back is usually from lower camps - not the higher camps where the garbage problem is worst. \"From higher camps, people tend to bring back oxygen bottles only,\" said Tshering Sherpa, chief executive officer of the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, which runs an Everest checkpoint. \"Other things like tents and cans and boxes of packed foods and drinks are mostly left behind there, that is why we can see so much of waste piling up.\" Mr Sherpa said on average a climber produces up to 12kg (26lbs) of waste on the mountain where they spend up to six weeks for acclimatisation and climbing. Apart from the \"flawed rule\" that required climbers to bring back less trash than they produce, authorities in the Everest region said lack of monitoring has been the main challenge. \"Apart from the check point above the Khumbu Icefall, there is no monitoring of what climbers are doing,\" said Mr Sherpa. Nepalese authorities are hoping a new scheme will be more effective.\n\nGetty Images Even the lower parts of the Everest region below the base camp see abandoned waste by visitors and trekkers\n\nUnder the changed rule, officials said, a non-refundable clean-up fee from climbers will be used to set up a checkpoint at Camp Two and also deploy mountain rangers who will keep going to the higher parts of the mountain to make sure climbers bring down their trash. Tourism ministry officials said it will most probably be $4,000 per climber - the same amount as deposit money - and will come into effect once passed by the parliament. Mingma Sherpa, chairperson of the Pasang Lhamu rural municipality, said the change was something the Sherpa community had lobbied for for many years now. \"We had been questioning the effectiveness of the deposit scheme all this time because we are not aware of anyone who was penalised for not bringing their trash down. \"And there was no designated fund but now this non-refundable fee will lead to creation of a fund that can enable us to do all these clean-up and monitoring works.\"\n\nGetty Images Increasing number of climbers on Mount Everest has been a growing concern for sustainable mountaineering", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:46:24 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T20:31:02.374055"}

The US president, whose 20-point peace plan requires the militant group to disarm, made the comments as he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida for talks on Monday.

As peace efforts intensified in 2025 under pressure from US President Donald Trump's administration, 40% more obituaries of soldiers were published in Russian sources compared with the previous year. Overall, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. BBC News Russian has been counting Russian war losses together with independent outlet Mediazona and a group of volunteers since February 2022. We keep a list of named individuals whose deaths we were able to confirm using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves. The real death toll is believed to be much higher, and military experts we have consulted believe our analysis of cemeteries, war memorials and obituaries might represent 45-65% of the total. That would put the number of Russian deaths at between 243,000 and 352,000. The number of obituaries for any given period is a preliminary estimate of the confirmed losses, as some need additional verification and will eventually be discarded. But it can indicate how the intensity of fighting is changing over time.\n\n2025 starts with a relatively low number of published obituaries in January, compared with the previous months. Then the number rises in February, when Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked directly for the first time about ending the war in Ukraine. The next peak in August coincides with the two presidents meeting each other in Alaska, a diplomatic coup for Putin that was widely seen as an end to his international isolation. In October, when a planned second Russia-US summit was eventually shelved, and then in November, when the US presented a 28-point peace proposal, an average of 322 obituaries were published per day - twice the average in 2024. It is difficult to put increased Russian losses down to any one factor, but the Kremlin sees territorial gains as a way of influencing negotiations with the US in its favour: Putin aide Yuri Ushakov stressed recently that \"recent successes\" had had a positive impact.\n\nMurat Mukashev was among those who gambled on a quick peace deal, and it cost him his life. Mukashev was an activist who had never supported Putin's policies. Over the years, he had taken part in demonstrations against police violence and torture, and joined rallies for LGBT rights and the release of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's main opponent who died in prison in 2024.\n\nMurat Mukashev Murat Mukashev was never a Putin supporter and had protested against the war and police violence\n\nHe had repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on social media from 2022. Then, in early 2024, Mukashev was detained near his home in Moscow and charged with large-scale drug dealing. While his case was being tried he was offered a contract with the defence ministry, according to his friends and family. They saw the heavy charges levelled against him as a typical ploy to get people to sign up. A 2024 law allows the accused a way out of a criminal conviction if they join up - an attractive option in a country with an acquittal rate of less than 1%. Mukashev refused the offer, and the court sentenced him to 10 years in a high-security penal colony. In prison in November 2024, he changed his mind. Friends said he was encouraged by Trump's promises to end the war quickly and decided he needed to sign up as soon as possible to secure his release before a peace deal was reached. \"He saw this as a chance to be released instead of being imprisoned for 10 years of strict regime,\" reads a statement from his support group. There was no explanation of how he reconciled taking part in the war with his reluctance to kill. On June 11 2025, Mukashev died fighting as part of an assault squad in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine. Like him, the majority of Russians killed at the front in 2025 had nothing to do with the military at the start of the full-scale war, BBC figures show. But since the bloody battle for the city of Avdiivka in October 2023, there has been a steady increase in casualties among so-called \"volunteers\" - those who have voluntarily signed a contract since the start of the invasion. They now appear to form the majority of Russia's new recruits, as opposed to professional soldiers who joined the army before the invasion or those mobilised for military service afterwards. A year ago 15% of Russian military deaths were volunteers, but in 2025 it was one in three.\n\nReuters File pic of Russian recruits in Rostov region\n\nLocal governments, under pressure to maintain a constant flow of new recruits, advertise hefty pay-outs, meet people who have large debts and campaign in universities and colleges. This means that the Kremlin has been able to compensate for heavy losses at the front while avoiding the politically risky move of a large-scale mandatory mobilisation. By October, 336,000 people had signed up for the military this year, according to National Security Council deputy chief Dmitry Medvedev - well over 30,000 a month. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has since said that 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed every month. If both are right, Russia is still recruiting more soldiers than it is losing. Based on obituaries and relatives' accounts, most of those who signed up to fight did so voluntarily; but there are reports of pressure and coercion, especially on regular conscripts and those charged with criminal offences. Some recruits mistakenly believe that after they have signed up for a year they can return to their old life with money in their pockets. A new recruit can earn up to 10m roubles (£95,000; $128,000) in a year. In reality all contracts signed with the defence ministry since September 2022 are automatically renewed until the war is over.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:12:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T02:22:03.981332"}

In 2024, the band announced that they were leaving their record agency Ador, alleging workplace harassment which Ador denied. The move set off a legal tussle that was only resolved in October this year - following a court ruling which said that the band had to stay with Ador until 2029. A month later, all five members said they would return to their record label. But on Monday, Ador announced that it had terminated their contract with one of its members, Danielle Marsh - bringing to an end any hope of a full-group comeback and leaving fans devastated.\n\nMany took to social media with the slogan: \"NewJeans is five or nothing.\" Other fans also questioned why Marsh was singled out. \"Does this make any sense???

The statement also named two other NewJeans members: Hanni, who it said decided to remain with the label after \"extended conversations\" which included her family, and Minji, who is still in \"ongoing conversations\" with the agency.

Bardot died on Sunday aged 91. A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right. But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.\n\nBardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off. Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for women's liberty and abortion rights. Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour.\n\nBut Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred. Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague. But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion. \"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media. There are differing types of national tribute in France. Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018.

The Saudi foreign ministry accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for southern Yemen, to launch recent offensives in the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra.

Two of the trickiest issues in Washington's 20-point plan involve territory and the fate of Europe's biggest nuclear plant, which is currently occupied by Russia. The Kremlin agrees with Trump that negotiations are \"at a final stage\", and Zelensky's next step is to meet European leaders in France on 6 January, but any one of the sticking points could jeopardise a deal.\n\nFate of Ukraine's industrial heartland coveted by Putin\n\nVladimir Putin has not budged from his maximalist demand for the whole of Ukraine's industrial Donbas, although Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has offered a compromise. Russian forces occupy most of the Luhansk region in the east but little more than 75% of Donetsk, and Putin wants it all, including the remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. \"We can't just withdraw, it's out of our law,\" says Zelensky. \"It's not only the law. People live there, 300,000 people... We can't lose those people.\" He has proposed Ukrainian forces pull back from the area to create a demilitarised or free economic zone policed by Ukraine, if the Russians pull back the same distance too. The current line of contact would then be policed by international forces. It is difficult to imagine Putin agreeing to any of that, and Russia's generals have told him they are capturing Ukrainian territory fast.\n\nAnadolu via Getty Images The two eastern cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk are coming under regular Russian attack\n\n\"If the authorities in Kyiv don't want to settle this business peacefully, we'll resolve all the problems before us by military means,\" Putin has claimed. Both sides are widely seen as suffering from exhaustion, and analysts from the Institute for the Study of War have estimated it would take Russian forces until August 2027 to conquer the rest of Donetsk if they are able to maintain their current rate of advance - which is not a given. Zelensky's compromise would also require Russian troops to leave other areas of Ukrainian territory where they maintain a limited presence, including Kharkiv and Sumy region in the north, Dnipropetrovsk in the east and Myokolaiv in the south. Without movement on Donetsk, the chance of a peace deal looks unrealistic, but a Russian compromise may not be out of the question. Kremlin envoy Yuri Ushakov said recently \"it's entirely possible that there won't be any troops [in Donbas], either Russian or Ukrainian\", although he was adamant the territory would be part of the Russian Federation.\n\nUkraine's huge nuclear power plant in Russian hands\n\nEver since March 2022, Russia has occupied Europe's biggest nuclear plant at Enerhodar, on the banks of the Dnipro river. But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years - and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown. To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant. Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone. The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has said that is unrealistic and instead the US and Ukraine could jointly manage it 50-50, with the US deciding where half of the power went - by implication to Russia. Ukraine's problem is that Russia will not let it go and the head of Russia's Rosatom nuclear agency Alexei Likachev has stressed that only one entity - Russia - can run it and ensure its safety. He has held out the possibility that Ukraine could use electricity generated by the plant in the context of international co-operation. Compromise on this issue may not be insurmountable, but it would require a level of trust between two neighbouring states when none exists.\n\nWashington Post via Getty Images The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant dominates the skyline near the Dnipro river\n\nLack of mutual trust despite positive rhetoric\n\nIt is hard to imagine significant progress on the biggest sticking points when there is so little trust. When Trump suggested this week that Putin \"wants to see Ukraine succeed… including supplying energy… at very low prices\", Zelensky clearly did not believe a word of it - he does not consider Putin as serious about peace. \"I don't trust Russians and... I don't trust Putin, and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" the Ukrainian leader said. Russia has also shown little faith in Kyiv - accusing Ukrainian forces of targeting drones at a Putin residence in the Novgorod region, although it gave no evidence of the attack. Ukraine denies it even happened and believes it is a Russian pretext for further Russian strikes on government buildings in Kyiv.\n\nOther sticking points that could derail deal\n\nKyiv has asked the US and European leaders for security guarantees to ensure a Nato-style response in the event of a further Russian attack. Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military. Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine. Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it. Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult. Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU. Few believe it will happen very soon.\n\nCould Ukrainians hold a vote on a deal?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:33:40 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T17:37:48.641121"}

A police spokesman likened the break-in to the Hollywood heist film Ocean's Eleven, telling AFP news agency it was \"very professionally executed\". During the heist at Sparkasse savings bank in the city of Gelsenkirchen, thieves broke open more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes containing money, gold and jewellery.

Yemen could yet become only one theatre in which the two vastly wealthy Gulf states vie for political influence, control of shipping lanes and commercial access.\n\nThe UAE has been dabbling in Yemen for years due to its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council.\n\nMany observers, including diplomats in Riyadh, had assumed that the UAE – often thought of as the junior if more ideological partner – would back down and tell the STC to delay or jettison its plan to declare independence and instead settle for negotiations on greater autonomy or more seats in Yemen’s coalition government body, the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC).\n\nSaudi Arabia had always seen Yemen as its preserve, first trying to defeat the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the north with a much-criticised bombing campaign in 2015 and then under international pressure reverting to diplomacy to try to reconcile the Houthis with the UN-recognised government in Aden.\n\nBut in the past month, the UAE has kicked over many assumed red lines in Yemen, leading to the Saudi bombing of vehicles docking at the Yemen port of Mukalla. Riyadh pointedly said the vehicles had been sent for STC use and had come from an Emirati port.\n\nSaudi Arabia said: “The Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat.”\n\nBut the UAE has been quietly considering commercial opportunities in Yemen for years. Tapping into the genuine, popular desire to restore the independence the south enjoyed prior to unification with the north in 1990, the UAE chose the STC as its vehicle.\n\nIt was a shrewd bet. The STC was finally recognised as a genuine player in 2019 when it was given seats on the PLC.\n\nAfter years being sidelined in UN peace efforts, the STC leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, slowly gained western recognition and was allowed to attend events such as the UN general assembly.\n\nBut the STC, feeding off longstanding cultural and economic grievances with the north, was never content with federalist solutions, and felt anyway it had been sidelined in the PLC.\n\nThis month, the STC grabbed its opportunity, sending in its forces into Hadramaut, the largest governorate in the south.\n\nWith its sudden eastward expansion, the STC controlled nearly all of the territory of the former South Yemen state, including its most productive oilfields.\n\nAfter seizing Hadramaut, it was relatively easyto take al Mahra, the most easterly governorate.\n\nIt was a severe shock to Saudi Arabia, which has since been applying diplomatic pressure on Abu Dhabi to demand the STC’s withdrawal.\n\nIn a ferocious diplomatic battle, Riyadh tried to isolate the UAE and the STC, making it clear that even if the STC stood its ground, southern Yemen would never progress beyond a micro-state lacking international recognition.\n\nSo far, the UAE is not buckling. The withdrawal of the few remaining UAE counter terror forces in Yemen announced on Tuesday is of no significance since UAE support for the STC remains.\n\nAbdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist, is portraying the UAE defence of the STC almost as a litmus test of the UAE’s character. He wrote on X: “The UAE does not let down nor abandon its allies. It supports them with generosity and political and military abundance. It does not leave them midway on the road to face their fate without support. It is clear in its policies and steps. It does not flee nor evade confrontation. It has a clear vision of its national and humanitarian responsibility and fulfils it with utmost care.”\n\nEqually patriotic statements are emerging from Riyadh. Farea al-Muslimi the Yemen and wider Gulf research fellow at Chatham House, is in little doubt about the enormity of what may be at stake.\n\n“After years of indirect competition through local proxies, the dispute now appears to be moving toward a more direct confrontation, with Saudi Arabia publicly accusing the UAE of actions that threaten its national security along its southern border,” he said.\n\n“The conflict reflects fundamental disagreements between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over the future political structure of Yemen and the balance of influence within it. Notably, the UAE – despite its greater geographic distance – has pursued a more interventionist and experimental approach on the ground.\n\n“Tensions between the two countries have been building for years. These actions suggest that the situation is entering a particularly dangerous phase. This development also evokes troubling parallels with the 2017 Gulf crisis involving Qatar, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE coordinated a major diplomatic rupture that destabilised regional relations for years.”\n\nAl-Muslimi added that the Houthis were “likely to view the growing rift between two of their principal adversaries with considerable advantage, observing as former coalition partners – who jointly fought and failed to defeat them – now turn against one another”.\n\nWestern governments, taking their lead from Washington, have shown in Sudan little desire to criticise the UAE in public, and in Yemen their sympathies will be with Saudi Arabia and the retention of a unitary state.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:19:44 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T17:37:49.379916"}

He said staff had told him there was a \"50% chance we go to Paris, 50% chance we go back to London\".\n\n\"I guess my new year plan is in the hands of the tunnel operators now,\" the 27-year-old Parisian said. Eurostar said it planned to run all of its services on Wednesday but warned there may still be some delays and cancellations. The service from London to Paris scheduled for 06:00 GMT has been cancelled. The problem with the overhead power supply and a broken down LeShuttle train blocked all routes on Tuesday, causing disruptions for thousands trying to get away for New Year's Eve. Some Eurostar and LeShuttle services had resumed on Tuesday evening, but delays remained, with only one of the tunnel's two rail lines open. Getlink, who run the Channel Tunnel, said work continued through the night to fix the power issue. On Wednesday morning, an update on Eurostar's website said: \"Services have resumed today following a power issue in the Channel Tunnel yesterday and some further issues with rail infrastructure overnight. \"We plan to run all of our services today, however due to knock-on impacts there may still be some delays and possible last-minute cancellations. \"Please check for live updates on the status of your train on the train status and timetables page.\"\n\nDennis van der Steen, from the Netherlands, was heading home to Amsterdam to spend New Year's Eve with his family and friends. Instead he said he spent six hours stuck on board a Eurostar train, before it began to move again at about 03:00 GMT. \"We're stuck,\" he told the BBC. He said there was no power onboard the train when it stopped, and that some passengers slept while others were \"also very worried\". He was later told his train would continue on its journey. Another passenger described feeling a \"rollercoaster of emotions\" for hours, not knowing whether the train he was on would be able to continue across the Channel or return to London. His train eventually made it to Brussels, he said, adding: \"Glad to be home, saw many families stranded.\"\n\nKelly North and Bethany Massey-Chase tell the BBC how they've had to re-book their Eurostar service to Paris\n\nImages of massive crowds of travellers stranded at London St Pancras International flooded social media following Tuesday's power outage. A photograph shared with the BBC by a train driver for Eurostar appeared to show overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks. Meanwhile, cars that had hoped to use the Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near the LeShuttle Terminal in Folkestone. Tim Brown, who had been trying to return to the UK after spending Christmas in Germany, told PA News he had been stuck in his car on the LeShuttle train for more than three hours with \"no access to food or water\". At least a dozen Eurostar services between the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had been cancelled by midday on Tuesday. The rail operator apologised and said passengers could rearrange their plans free of charge or can cancel their booking and get a refund or an e-voucher. On Tuesday, Eurostar has urged its customers \"to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available\". \"We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have been already been cancelled.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:56:15 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T04:59:53.179696"}

Zia, who was the country's first female prime minister, died on Tuesday from a prolonged illness. She was 80. The mourners held out their hands in prayer and carried flags printed with her photographs as a motorcade carrying Zia's body - including the hearse wrapped with the national flag - drove on streets near the parliament house.

Zia will be buried next to her husband Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 while serving as president - an incident that thrusted Zia into political limelight. She went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years. She was dubbed an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to participate in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s. Her career, which included spells in prison and house arrest, was defined by a bitter feud with her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina. Over the past 16 years, under Hasina's Awami League government, Zia emerged as the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule many saw as increasingly autocratic. Despite Zia's illness, the BNP said she had intended to run for parliament in February, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution last year unseated Hasina. According to the party's candidate list released earlier this month, Zia was to contest in three constituencies. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, Zia's son Tarique Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader.

Kaja Kallas' comments on social media appear to be a reference to the Kremlin's allegation that Ukraine attempted a drone strike on one of Vladimir Putin's residences. \"No one should accept unfounded claims from the aggressor who has indiscriminately targeted Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians,\" Kallas wrote on social media. Earlier this week Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia.\n\nRussia would review its position in the ongoing peace negotiations as a result, the Kremlin said. Since Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov first shared the claims, Russian state media and politicians have discussed the alleged attack in increasingly incendiary tones. \"The attack is a strike on the heart of Russia,\" said Andrei Kartapolov, head of the Russian parliament's defence committee. \"After what [Ukraine] has done, there can be no forgiveness.\" Although the Kremlin initially said it saw no point in sharing proof of the alleged attack, on Wednesday the Russian army released what it said was evidence of the attempted strike. It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot. The profile of the wrecked UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) does bear similarities to Ukrainian-produced Chakluns – but because the components of the drone pictured are inexpensive and widely available online, they cannot be conclusively to traced to the Ukrainian military.\n\nRussian defence ministry Russia's defence ministry released a map which it claimed showed the path of the drones launched by Ukraine\n\nRussia's defence ministry also released a video of what it said was a local resident who described hearing noises like a rocket at the time of the alleged attack. However, one Russian investigative media outlet said it had spoken to more than a dozen residents of the area around Putin's residence and none had heard anything that could indicate 91 drones had approached or been shot down by air defences. \"If something like that had happened, the whole city would have been talking about it,\" one person told the outlet. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has strenuously denied the allegations, tying them to the ongoing US-led process to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. In recent weeks the American and Ukrainian delegations have been working closely and Zelensky has expressed cautious optimism that his country's demands were going to be taken into account. In his view, he said on Tuesday, the claims about the drone attack on Putin's Valdai residence were about \"the fact that over the past month there were quite successful talks and a positive meeting between our teams, culminating in our meeting with President Trump.\" Russia wanted to disrupt the \"positive momentum\" between the US and Ukraine, Zelensky said. When the claims emerged Zelensky also warned that the alleged drone strike would be used as an excuse to carry out strikes on Kyiv and Ukrainian government buildings. Overnight on Wednesday air alerts briefly rang out in the capital as a drone approached, but no hits or damage were reported.\n\nState Emergency Service of Ukraine On 30 December Odesa suffered an intense attack which left several civilians injured\n\nInstead, several locations across the country were hit by drones and Odesa on the Black Sea suffered a large-scale attack which saw an apartment block hit and six people injured, including three children.

An overhaul of the tax system announced late last year removes many exemptions that were in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child rule. It also exempts marriage-related services and elderly care from value added tax (VAT) - part of a broader effort that includes extending parental leave and issuing cash handouts. Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young Chinese people to marry, and couples to have children.\n\nOfficial figures show that China's population has shrunk three years in a row, with just 9.54 million babies born in 2024. That is around half of the number of births recorded a decade ago, when China started to ease its rules on how many children people could have. Still, the tax on contraceptives, including condoms, birth control pills and devices, has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates, as well as ridicule. Some people point out that it would take a lot more than pricey condoms to persuade them to have children. As one retailer urged shoppers to stock up ahead of the price hike, a social media user joked: \"I'll buy a lifetime's worth of condoms now.\" People can tell the difference between the price of a condom and that of raising a child, wrote another. China is one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. Costs are pushed up by school fees in a highly competitive academic environment, and the challenge women have juggling work and parenting, the study said. The economic slowdown, partly brought on by a property crisis that has hit savings, has left families, and especially young people, feeling uncertain or less confident about their future. \"I have one child, and I don't want any more,\" says 36-year-old Daniel Luo, who lives in the eastern province of Henan. \"It's like when subway fares increase. When they go up by a yuan or two, people who take the subway don't change their habits. You still have to take the subway, right?\" He says he is not concerned by the price hike. \"A box of condoms might cost an extra five yuan, maybe 10, at most 20. Over a year, that's just a few hundred yuan, completely affordable.\"\n\nGetty Images Young couples in China, like elsewhere, are having fewer or no children\n\nBut cost might be a problem for others, and that's what worries Rosy Zhao, who lives in the city of Xi'an in central China. She says making contraception, which is a necessity, more expensive could mean students or those struggling financially \"take a risk\". That would be the policy's \"most dangerous potential outcome\", she added. Observers appear divided on the aim of the tax overhaul. The idea that a tax hike on condoms will impact birth rates is \"overthinking it\", says demographer Yi Fuxian from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He believes Beijing is keen to collect taxes \"wherever it can\" as it battles a housing market slump and growing national debt. At nearly $1tn (£742bn), China's VAT revenue made up close to 40% of the country's tax collection last year. The move to tax condoms is \"symbolic\" and reflects Beijing's attempts to encourage people to lift China's \"strikingly low\" fertility numbers, said Henrietta Levin from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is also hampering efforts, she adds, is that a lot of the policies and subsidies will have to be implemented by indebted provincial governments - and it's unclear if they can spare sufficient resources. China's approach to urging people to have children also risks backfiring if people feel the government is being \"too intrusive\" about what is deeply personal choice, she said. Recently there have been media reports that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about their menstrual cycles and plans to have children. The local health bureau in Yunnan province said such data was needed to identify expectant mothers. But this has not helped the government's image, Ms Levin said. \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\"\n\nGetty Images China is one of the priciest countries to raise a child, a study in 2024 found", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:07:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T23:43:40.031569"}

Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four years of conflict would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\". In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his troops that \"we believe in you and our victory\". Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence of Ukraine using drones to target Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied.\n\nIt included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot. Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said. However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.\n\nWatch: BBC's Steve Rosenberg asks Russians what they are hoping for in 2026\n\nIn his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas. Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear. \"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\" By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter. Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\" Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said.

Viewers rushed to watch the final episode, which concludes the 10-year run of the sci-fi horror series, as it was released at 01:00 GMT. Some fans also attended special cinema screenings of the finale in cities across the US and Canada, several of which were attended by the show's stars. Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, Stranger Things first aired in 2016 and stars Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder and David Harbour.\n\nThe dramatic two-hour series finale, titled Chapter Eight: The Rightside Up, initially overloaded Netflix servers. Several fans said they were shown an error message as they tried to play it - something that often happens with big new releases on streaming platforms. But the episode was soon restored and viewers were able to watch a finale that included massive battle scenes and emotional tributes that brought in all five seasons, giving closure to the characters that we've fallen in love with over the years. The finale left you on the edge of your seat at moments and had you both cheering and crying in others.\n\nNetflix Finn Wolfhard was cheered by fans as he arrived to introduce the finale at a screening in Vancouver\n\nA lot was riding on Netflix and The Duffer Brothers, who created the 1980s-inspired, monster-infused, inter-dimensional series. Ending any beloved series comes with both anticipation and a lot of critics. So far this season, fans have picked apart scenes and gone through past seasons in an attempt to piece together how it all might end in the Upside Down. Viewers have been quick to point out gaps in the story or issues they felt with the script writing, pointing out flaws in Will Byers' coming out scene or issues such as Holly Wheeler's jacket having a logo for Under Amour (a brand that wasn't created until 1996) appearing on screen. Countless theories discussed on social media only hyped up the ending of this saga. Fans guessed about possibilities like time travel coming into play (clocks have been a major plot point for multiple seasons, after all), took bets on what main character might die and some had far-fetched thoughts on Henry Creel \"Vecna\" using mind control on the characters throughout this season to explain various holes in the storytelling. In the end, some theories were spot on. Others, not one bit. Do not read any further if you do not want to know what happens in the finale of Stranger Things.\n\nGetty Images Actor Brett Gelman attended a screening in Topanga as part of the multi-city finale premiere\n\nNetflix These fans attended a screening in Los Angeles to watch the finale on the big screen\n\nGetty Images Actress Cara Buono attended a premiere in New York and introduced the finale from cinema stage\n\nIn the finale, we see an epic final fight that requires all the characters to finally defeat Vecna and the Mind Flayer before worlds merge and Hawkins, Indiana – and Earth as we know it – is taken over. We don't see dramatic deaths in the core group of stars we've come to love over five seasons – though we did see the death of Kali (Eight). What happened to Eleven, though, is up for interpretation. She is left with an impossible choice. At first, viewers are left to believe she chose to remain behind in the Upside Down as it explodes and is demolished forever in order to eliminate the possibility of being used to create more children with powers like hers. But later, in a lengthy epilogue scene, Mike Wheeler takes us down another possibility - Eleven using Kali's illusion powers to make it seem as though she died before making a grand escape.\n\nNetflix\n\nHe says he thinks she finally made it the place they talked about running off to – a land with three waterfalls. Mike says it's what he likes to believe – and each member of their Dungeons and Dragons party – Will, Dustin, Lucas and Max – all agree that they, too, believe. It's a fitting end that leaves open the possibility that Eleven, too, has a happy ending. The epilogue takes us 18 months into the future after the Upside Down is demolished and Vecna – and the Mind Flayer – is defeated. We see Hooper and Joyce get engaged and the older crew of teens talk about their lives in university and in their careers. It's a happy ending for everyone. But even with such an epic finale, there are certainly holes in the story that weren't fully explained in the last episode. It's sure to be a finale that pleases some fans and has others wanting more.\n\nGetty Images Several fans dressed up to attend the finale screenings - including this pair in Vancouver\n\nNetflix Netflix handed out merchandise such as bags, figurines and T-shirts at many of the screenings\n\nGetty Images Two fans in Vancouver, pictured with a special Demogorgon Crunch breakfast cereal\n\nIn the US and Canada, the finale was given a full cinematic release in theatres.

Thomas Byrnes, chief executive of MarketImpact, a consultancy for the humanitarian sector, has been tracking aid cuts throughout the past year and said the $2bn was significantly less than the $3.38bn in funds given by the US to the UN in 2025, all of which was provided under the previous Biden administration.\n\n“This is a carefully staged political announcement that obscures more than it reveals,” said Byrnes.\n\nHe said the contribution was better than nothing but that it would have a limited impact in the context of other US decisions, including cutting $5bn in foreign assistance already approved by Congress as “woke, weaponised and wasteful spending” and a proposal to end support for peacekeeping missions – for which it already owes the United Nations $1.5bn.\n\nByrnes suggested that channelling the money through Ocha may be less about partnership and more an attempt to centralise control and have one UN body on which to make demands about how aid should be distributed.\n\nPatz shared that concern and said he was worried about whether the money would even materialise if the UN failed to meet the expectations set out by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to “cut bloat, remove duplication”.\n\n“I would be cautious,” he said. “This is $2bn promised, but not $2bn given.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:00:40 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T13:37:42.303231"}

Instead, she said, body parts might have been removed as part of a funerary ritual, perhaps to be carried as tokens.\n\nDr Jessica Thompson, a senior author of the study from Yale University, said that, while such practices may not seem relatable, people still keep locks of hair or relatives’ ashes for scattering in a meaningful place.\n\nThe researchers said the rock shelter appears to have been used as a natural monument, with burials occurring from about 16,000 to 8,000 years ago. As well as complete skeletons, very small collections of bones from different individuals have been found.\n\n“[This] supports our hypothesis that some of the missing bones from the cremated woman may have been deliberately removed and taken as tokens for curation or reburial elsewhere,” said Dr Ebeth Sawchuk, a co-author of the study from the University of Alberta.\n\nThe team also found flakes and points from stone-knapping within the pyre, which might have been added as part of a funeral ritual.\n\n“Were people actively throwing these things into the fire or … were they in the body itself?” said Thompson. Cerezo-Román said one possibility is that people were knapping stones to cut the woman’s flesh.\n\nThe team also found the pyre was about the size of a queen-sized mattress, and would have taken considerable knowledge, skill and coordination to build and maintain, while the two clusters of bones indicate the body was moved during cremation.\n\nWhile it is unclear why the woman was given such special treatment, the team found at least one fire was subsequently made directly above the location of the pyre – possibly as an act of remembrance.\n\nHowever, the site also has evidence of multiple campfires, with Thompson noting it is likely the shelter would also have been used for daily life.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sharp points of grey flint and rock from stone-knapping found in the pyre.

On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million. Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analyst's estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole. The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.\n\nIn October, Tesla introduced lower-priced versions of its two best-selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales. It had faced criticism that it had been slow to release new and more affordable options to stay competitive. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn). As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\". Tesla sales slumped in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk's role in US President Donald Trump's administration. Besides Tesla, the multi-billionaire's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels. Those commitments, along with running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.

It previously accused the companies of selling their products at unfairly low prices and threatened tariffs of almost 92%.\n\nBut on Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry said the proposed rate had now been drastically cut back.\n\nThe move could have resulted in American importers being taxed at a rate greater than the value of the actual pasta itself, and prices rising sharply for US consumers.\n\nItalian pasta is set to be spared from high-level US tariffs that the Trump administration had threatened against 13 producers.\n\nTariffs are a type of tax paid by a consumer who imports a product.\n\nSince returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of these taxes, though some have since been softened.\n\nThe president has sought to address trade practices that he sees as harmful to the US and boost American manufacturing.\n\nBut economists have consistently warned that such moves can ultimately drive up costs for consumers, worsening cost-of-living issues.\n\nIn the case of pasta, the US alleged that Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, which undercut local producers. This pricing policy is sometimes known as dumping.\n\nThe commerce department was planning to charge a tariff rate of 91.74% for American imports of pasta made by the 13 Italian producers.\n\nGiven that there is now an underlying 15% tariff on most products bought into the US from the European Union, the plan would have resulted in the rate of tax on pasta exceeding 100% of its value.\n\nIt sparked fears of consumers experiencing major price increases, although the produce made by the 13 companies represents only a small share of total Italian pasta imported into the US.\n\nThe plan would have also represented a political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who enjoys a relatively close relationship with Trump among European leaders.\n\nOn Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry announced that the US had wound back its plan, saying this represented \"an acknowledgement by the US authorities of the constructive co-operation shown by Italian companies\".\n\nIn the case of one brand, La Molisana, the tariff rate had been dropped as low as 2.26%, the Italian statement added.

Both Gulf powers have intervened on behalf of Yemen's internationally recognised government in the country's long-running civil war, but a fracturing of the alliance has seen them backing different rival groups on the ground, one of whom is now pushing to declare the independence of a breakaway state in southern Yemen. On Friday, the UAE-backed force declared that a \"war\" had begun, accusing Saudi-backed ground forces of launching an attack alongside air strikes by the Saudi air force. Yemen's civil war broke out in 2014 and has plunged the already impoverished country into years of deadly violence and one of the world's worst hunger crises.\n\nAt the start of the war, the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement took control of most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the government. The conflict escalated in 2015, when a coalition of Arab states including Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched a military campaign to restore the government's rule. A ceasefire has de-escalated the conflict with the Houthis in recent years and led to a freezing of the front lines. But the Saudi-backed ruling coalition – the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), formed in 2022 and designed to unite various anti-Houthi factions - has frayed. At the same time, the vast majority of southern Yemen has been taken by UAE-backed separatists, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is formally part of the coalition.\n\nReuters Saudi Arabia warned the UAE that offensives in eastern Yemen constituted threats to its security\n\nThe infighting escalated on 2 December, when the STC - which seeks an independent state in the south - launched a large-scale military offensive in the east of the country and rapidly took control of territory from government forces. The STC's advances included the oil-rich Hadramawt province that borders Saudi Arabia. The STC said the offensive was necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south. But it was denounced as a \"rebellion\" by the head of the PLC, Rashad al-Alimi, who said the STC's separatist push threatened to fracture Yemen and plunge the region into chaos. Tensions have further escalated with air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition. On Friday, seven people were killed in an air strike on an STC military camp in Hadramawt, an STC official said. That followed air strikes on Tuesday on the southern port of Mukalla, where the coalition accused the UAE of delivering two ships loaded with military equipment to the separatists over the weekend. No casualties were reported but images of burnt-out vehicles shared on social media after the strikes suggested the strikes directly targeted the UAE hardware.\n\nAFP The Saudi-led coalition air strike on Mukalla destroyed a number of military vehicles and pick-up trucks\n\nThe UAE foreign ministry denied the allegations, saying the shipment did not contain weapons and that the vehicles were to be used by Emirati forces in the country. Following Tuesday's strikes, the head of Yemen's Presidential Council said it had cancelled a joint defence treaty with the UAE and ordered all its forces to leave the country within 24 hours. The Saudi foreign ministry backed the call for the Emirati forces to leave, accusing the UAE of pressuring the STC to launch the offensive in the east, which has reached Saudi Arabia's borders. The ministry warned that Saudi Arabia's national security was a \"red line\". The UAE denied it was behind the STC's recent military campaign but, in a move that was unexpected to many, hours later it conceded to the demand and agreed to withdraw its forces from Yemen.\n\nThe UAE's motivations in supporting the STC in Yemen are seen as helping it secure access to key sea ports and challenging an Islamist party that sits in the government. But even if the UAE fully removes its physical presence in Yemen, it \"won't change anything\" and does not signify a backdown of the STC forces it supports, says Farea al-Muslimi, a researcher at Chatham House. \"The UAE hasn't had a significant troop presence in Yemen since 2019. It has relied on special forces and mostly its network of proxies working directly on the ground,\" says Mr Muslimi.\n\nEPA More than 19 million people require humanitarian assistance in Yemen\n\nIn the newly contested areas like Hadramawt, the prospect of a wider conflagration of fighting is alarming families. \"Some people are thinking of going to villages or staying with relatives if things get worse. But most people don't really have the option to leave the city,\" says Mohamed from Mukalla. \"Most people are going out less [and] have stored some goods like flour and rice. Everyone is following the news closely, moment by moment.\" Years of devastating conflict have ravaged Yemen's economy. The country's roughly 40 million people have endured what aid agencies say is the world's third worst hunger crisis - one that has repeatedly threatened to reach famine levels. In 2021, the UN estimated that 377,000 people had died as a result of the conflict and its impact on hunger and healthcare, of which 259,000 were said to be children under the age of five. While the current conflict is being framed from the outside as an emerging proxy war between two Gulf powers, close watchers of Yemeni politics have seen the recent escalations by the STC as a long time coming. The STC's ambitions have risen after its recent expansion of control over nearly all of the south of the country, Yemeni affairs journalist Anwar al-Ansi told BBC Arabic. \"[STC chief Aidarous] Al-Zubaidi has been the most consistent person inside Yemen, consistently demanding independence for southern Yemen. So, no, I don't think he will give up,\" says Mr Muslimi.\n\nReuters The Southern Transitional Council wants an independent state in south Yemen", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:59:53 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:42.633803"}

The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Trump said Venezuela's left-wing president and his wife were flown out of the country in a military operation in conjunction with US law enforcement. Explosions were reported across Venezuelan's capital, Caracas, in the early hours of Saturday morning, including at military bases. The Venezuelan government has demanded proof Maduro is alive and deployed its armed forces. A national emergency has been declared in the country. Maduro's capture comes after heightened tensions between the two countries, with Washington striking boats in the Caribbean it says are being used to carry drugs. The US has accused Maduro of being personally involved in drug-smuggling and being an illegitimate leader. Maduro has, in turn, accused the US of intimidation. Here is what we know so far.\n\nWhat do we know about Maduro's capture?\n\nThere are few details about Maduro's capture. Trump did not give more details about how Maduro was detained or where he has been taken. Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta force – the military's top counter terrorism unit - according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Trump is due to hold a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida at 11:00 EST (16:00 GMT) at which further details about the operation may be disclosed.\n\nWhat happened during the strikes?\n\nAFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas\n\nAround 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT), loud explosions were heard in Caracas, while plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. Reports of places hit by strikes include military airfield, La Carlota, in the centre of the capital and the main military base of Fuerte Tiuna. Surrounding communities were also without power. Videos of explosions and helicopters flying overhead have been circulating on social media, but they have not been verified yet. It is not currently known if there have been any casualties. The Venezuelan government also said the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira were also hit.\n\nHow has Venezuela reacted?\n\nVenezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez said the government did not know where Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were, and demanded \"immediate proof of life\" for them both. The country's defence minister Vladimir Padrino López claimed the strikes hit civilian areas and said the government was compiling information about dead and injured people. He added that Venezuela would \"resist\" the presence of foreign troops. Venezuela's government issued an official statement denouncing the \"extremely serious military aggression\" by the US \"against Venezuelan territory and population in civilian and military locations\". It accused the US of threatening international peace and stability and described the attack as an attempt to seize \"Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals\" in an attempt to \"forcibly break the political independence of the nation.\"\n\nWhat has Donald Trump said?\n\nReuters\n\nImmediately after the explosions, the White House declined to public comment. But Trump later took to his Truth Social platform to confirm the US was behind the strikes. \"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\" Trump wrote. \"This operation was done in conjunction with US Law Enforcement.

It doesn't usually send in the military and physically remove them. Venezuela's abrupt awakening took two forms. Its residents were woken abruptly to the sound of deafening booms: the sound of its capital Caracas under attack from US strikes targeting military infrastructure. Its government has now woken up from any illusion that US military intervention or regime change was just a distant threat. US President Donald Trump has announced its leader, Nicolás Maduro, has been captured and flown out of the country. He now faces a US trial over weapons and drugs charges.\n\nThe US has not carried out direct military intervention in Latin America like this since its 1989 invasion of Panama to depose the then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega. Back then, like now, Washington framed this as part of wider crackdown on drug trafficking and criminality. The US has long accused Maduro, too, of leading a criminal trafficking organisation, something he strongly denies. It designated as a foreign terrorist group the 'Cartel de los Soles' - a name the US uses to describe a group of elites in Venezuela who it alleges orchestrate illegal activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining. For years, Maduro's government has been accused of human rights abuses. In 2020, United Nations investigators said its government had committed \"egregious violations\" amounting to crimes against humanity such as extrajudicial killings, torture, violence and disappearances - and that Maduro and other top officials were implicated. Human rights organisations have recorded hundreds of political prisoners in the country, including some detained after anti-government protests. This latest operation, striking inside a sovereign capital directly, marks a dramatic escalation in US engagement in the region. The forcible removal of Maduro will be hailed a major victory by some of the more hawkish figures within the US administration, many of whom have argued that only direct intervention could force Maduro from power. Washington has not recognised him as the country's president since the 2024 elections. The opposition published electronic voting tallies after the vote which it said proved it, not Maduro, won the election. The result was deemed neither free nor fair by international election observers. The opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was barred from running in it. But for Venezuela's government, this intervention confirms what it has long claimed - that Washington's ultimate goal is regime change.\n\nVenezuela has also accused the US of wanting to \"steal\" its oil reserves, the largest in the world, and other resources – an allegation it felt was vindicated after the US seized at least two oil tankers off the coast. The strikes and capture come after months of US military escalation in the region. The US has sent its biggest military deployment in decades to the region, comprising warplanes, thousands of troops, helicopters and the world's largest warship. It has carried out dozens of strikes on alleged small drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 110 people. Any doubts that remained that those operations were at least in part about regime change too have now been dashed by today's actions. What remains deeply unclear is what comes next inside Venezuela itself. The US would clearly like the Venezuelan opposition, who it is allied with, to take power – potentially either led by opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, or the opposition candidate from the 2024 elections Edmundo Gonzalez. However, even some strong critics of Maduro warn this would not be simple given the government's grip on power in the country. It controls the judiciary, the Supreme Court, the military – and is aligned with powerfully armed paramilitaries known as \"colectivos\".\n\nAFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:29:50 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T16:34:53.066213"}

A school friend was a fan of the British-designed toys and told her all about them. But she only fell in love with the brand when she saw a gingerbread house plushie on the Chinese social media app RedNote. Christmas is not widely celebrated in China and is more of a commercial event than anything more traditional. \"The festival doesn't mean a lot to me... But I always like the sight of gingerbread houses,\" she says. It was then that she asked her friend in their hometown Guangzhou to buy it for her. That was in 2021, just as Jellycat was about to make it big in China and around the world. \"Everyone felt jittery, and no-one knew what would happen,\" says Stella, who has developed a habit of petting and squeezing her plushies since Covid. She had to spend a lot of time at her home, in Beijing, which had some of the strictest lockdowns in China, if not the world. Now 32, Stella has a new job, as a sales manager in the tourism industry, but is still buying Jellycats. Her collection has grown to 120 toys, costing a total of about 36,000 yuan ($5,145; £3,815). \"At my age, there are many things you can't share with others... and the troubles we face are a lot more complicated than before,\" she says with a sigh. \"The plushies help me regulate my emotions.\" Originally aimed at children, the squishy toys have become a global hit, especially in China where a disenchanted youth has been turning to them for comfort.\n\nThe kidults\n\nStella's Gingerbread house plushie is an \"Amuseable\", a line of toys with tiny faces modelled on inanimate objects from toilet rolls to boiled eggs. The plushies are the \"breakout products\" which \"appeal to a wide Gen-Z and millennial audience\" around the world, says Kasia Davies of global analysis firm Statista. The popularity of these toys \"may have something to do with wanting to feel companiable\", Isabel Galleymore of the University of Birmingham, in the UK, says. It is difficult to say for sure whether Jellycat started the now-iconic Amuseable line, which was launched in 2018, to tap into the young adult market. But toy manufacturers need to find a new market given the falling birth rate in much of the world, Ms Davies adds. And as early as in 2015, Jellycat entered the Chinese market. Having done the \"groundwork\", the toy maker was able to capture \"the tone of the pandemic\" – when people sought comfort amid heightened uncertainty – and built on its success in China, says Kathryn Read, a business consultant with 15 years' experience in China. Jellycat's popularity was further propelled by its pop-up experiences. The in-store events offer a menu of limited-edition \"food\". Many fans film themselves being served and post the clips on social media. Localisation has also been a core strategy for the Jellycat experience. Fans could buy stuffed toy versions of items like fish, chips and mushy peas at a temporary shop at the department store Selfridges in London.\n\nMeanwhile, teapot and teacup plushies were among the items sold at special outlets in Beijing and Shanghai last year. In 2024, the UK-based firm's revenue rose by two-thirds to £333m ($459m), according to its most recent Companies House accounts. In the same period, it sold about $117m worth of toys to Chinese consumers on major e-commerce platforms, according to estimates by Beijing-based Moojing Market Intelligence. The company's growing popularity mirrors a wider boom in China's collectable-toy market among young adults seeking emotional comfort and connection. Overall sales of collectable toys in China are expected to top 110bn yuan this year, according to a 2024 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the China Animation Association. The runaway success of Labubu, the elf-like dolls created by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, highlights the country's growing appetite for collectable toys, especially among young people. This \"kidult\" trend is not unique to China, as young adults around the world question \"outdated understandings of adulthood\", says Prof Erica Kanesaka, a cultural expert at Emory University in the US. Global toy sales fell in 2024 - albeit by less than 1% - but collectable toy sales rose by almost 5%, to a record high, according to market research company Circana.\n\nCFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images Jellycat had pop-up stores in Shanghai and Beijing\n\nJellycat In September, Jellycat partnered with A-list actress Yang Mi during a pop-up event in Shanghai\n\nAmuseables, especially the aubergine, which Chinese fans call \"the boss\", have also spawned memes, with many sharing frustrations about adult life. \"Aubergine boss\" is a hashtag on RedNote, where fans draw different expressions on the plushie. In these memes, the aubergine appears in various moods from drinking to fake-smiling. For example, Wendy Hui from Hong Kong modified her aubergine Amuseable by drawing dark circles around its eyes and putting a pair of glasses on it. She then posted a picture of it on Threads with the caption: \"The mental state of workers on Monday.\" \"I kept working at home even when I was supposed to be off,\" the 30-something marketing professional says. \"I just wanted to express how exhausted I was.\" Jellycat has become an unexpected, light-hearted outlet for young Chinese people to air their grievances about a slowing economy, where hard work doesn't guarantee comparable rewards. Despite heavy censorship, the internet has remained an important, if not the only, space for such conversations.\n\nThe brand also often launches limited-edition products and retires designs. The strategy, which many in China call \"hunger marketing\", has also helped make Jellycat toys a favourite on social media in the country. Collecting can feel like a treasure hunt, with fans combing department stores and independent shops for Jellycats when they travel overseas. Some resort to \"daigou\", overseas-based shopping agents. And rare Jellycats, a status symbol among some fans, change hands for more than $1,400. But most are cheap pick-me-ups amid a sluggish economy plagued by a property crisis and high local government debt. China's youth unemployment rate has eased a little after hitting a record high in August, but official figures show it is still above 17%. \"You have to consider for a long time before buying a luxury bag,\" 34-year-old medical sales representative Jessie Chen says. \"But you don't need to do that for a Jellycat. \"Jellycat also sells bags, which cost just a few hundred yuan [tens of US dollars].

A small team, including one source within the Venezuelan government, had been observing where the 63-year-old slept, what he ate, what he wore and even, according to top military officials, \"his pets\". Then, in early December, a planned mission dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" was finalised. It was the result of months of meticulous planning and rehearsals, which even included elite US troops creating an exact full-size replica of Maduro's Caracas safe house to practise their entry routes. The plan - which amounted to an extraordinary US military intervention in Latin America not seen since the Cold War - was closely guarded. Congress was not informed or consulted ahead of time. With the precise details set, top military officials simply had to wait for the optimal conditions to launch. They wanted to maximise the element of surprise, officials said on Saturday. There was a false start four days earlier when President Trump gave approval but they opted to wait for better weather and less cloud cover. \"Over the weeks through Christmas and New Year, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action,\" General Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, told a news conference on Saturday morning.\n\n'Good luck and Godspeed'\n\nThe order from the president to begin the mission finally came at 22:46 EDT on Friday. \"We were going to do this four days ago, three days ago, two days ago, and then all of a sudden it opened up. And we said: Go,\" Trump himself told Fox & Friends on Saturday in the hours after the overnight raid. \"He said to us, and we appreciate it… good luck and Godspeed,\" Gen Caine said. Trump's order came shortly before midnight in Caracas, giving the military most of the night to operate in darkness. What followed was a two-hour and twenty-minute mission by air, land and sea that stunned many in Washington and around the world. In terms of scale and precision, it was virtually unprecedented. And it drew immediate condemnation from several regional powers, with Brazil's President Lula da Silva saying the violent capture of Venezuela's leader set \"yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community\".\n\nTrump did not follow the mission from the White House situation room. Instead, he was surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he watched a live stream of the operation flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"It was an incredible thing to see,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally like I was watching a television show. And if you would've seen the speed, the violence… it's just, it was an amazing thing, an amazing job that these people did.\"\n\nDonald Trump / TruthSocial Trump watched a live stream of the operation from his Florida estate\n\nIn recent months, thousands of US troops have deployed to the region, joining an aircraft carrier and dozens of warships in the largest military build-up in decades as President Trump has accused Maduro of drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism, and blown up dozens of small boats accused of ferrying drugs through the region. But the first signs of Operation Absolute Resolve were in the skies. More than 150 aircraft - including bombers, fighter jets and reconnaissance planes - were ultimately deployed through the course of the night, according to US officials. \"It was very complex, extremely complex, the whole manoeuvre, the landings, the number of aircraft,\" Trump told Fox News. \"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation.\" Loud explosions were heard in Caracas at about 02:00 local time, and plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. \"I heard a huge sound, a loud bang,\" reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero told the BBC. \"It moved all the windows. Immediately after I saw a huge cloud of smoke that almost blocked the entire view.\" \"Planes and helicopters were flying all over the city,\" she said.\n\nWatch: Smoke, bangs and helicopters in Caracas\n\nSoon videos showing numerous aircraft in the skies - and others showing the apparent aftermath of explosions - began to circulate widely on social media. One showed a convoy of helicopters flying at low altitude over Caracas as smoke rose from apparent detonations. \"We woke up at around 01:55 to the roar of explosions and the hum of planes flying over Caracas,\" one witness. Daniela, told the BBC. \"Everything was plunged into absolute darkness, illuminated only by the flashes of nearby detonations.\" \"Neighbours were messaging in the condominium group chat, all confused and unaware of what was happening [and] frightened by the blasts,\" she said. BBC Verify has examined a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted. So far, it has confirmed five locations including Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La Carlota and Port La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea.\n\nSome of the US strikes targeted air defence systems and other military targets, officials said. Trump also suggested the US cut the power in Caracas before the mission began, although he did not specify how. \"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,\" he said. \"It was dark and it was deadly.\"\n\n'They knew we were coming'\n\nAs strikes rang out around Caracas, US forces made their way into the city. They included members of the elite Delta Force, the US military's top special mission unit, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS. They were heavily armed - and carried a blowtorch in case they had to cut through the metal doors of Maduro's safe house. The troops arrived at Maduro's location shortly after the strikes began at 02:01 local time, according to Gen Caine. Trump described the safe house as a heavily fortified military \"fortress\" in the heart of Caracas. \"They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming,\" he said. The troops took fire when they arrived, and one of the American helicopters was hit but was still able to fly. \"The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline,\" Gen Caine said. \"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,\" Trump said. It was only as the operation - which also saw Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, seized - was unfolding that Secretary of State Rubio began notifying lawmakers about the action, a decision which has since prompted anger from some in Congress. \"Let me be clear: Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate dictator. But launching military action without congressional authorisation and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless,\" said top Democrat Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate. Briefing Congress ahead of time would have endangered the mission, Rubio told reporters during the news conference on Saturday. \"Congress has a tendency to leak,\" Trump added. \"This would not be good.\"\n\nGetty Images The US struck several locations around Caracas, including Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 23:42:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T02:35:17.481705"}

People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation. Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she is grateful to the US for \"taking Maduro out of here\" because now, she \"at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again\". But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name.\n\nJorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be \"well-supported by Trump and the entire United States\", he fears the coming days will not be easy. \"Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?\" Jorge told the BBC. \"It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\" Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". Early Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. As Maduro and his wife are extradited to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking. But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC. Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. \"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said of Trump. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\" The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, is that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country.\n\nVenezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 01:23:56 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T02:35:17.628088"}

US oil companies would also fix Venezuela's \"broken infrastructure\" and \"start making money for the country\", the US president said. The US launched strikes on Venezuela on Saturday morning in which Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were captured by US forces and removed from the country. Venezuela announced a state of national emergency and denounced the \"military aggression\", with the country's vice president saying Maduro is its only leader.\n\nMaduro and Flores were flown out of the capital, Caracas, on a US helicopter in the early hours of Saturday morning and taken aboard the USS Iwo Jima at an unknown location in the Caribbean Sea. They were later flown to the Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base in Cuba before being transferred to another plane to head to New York state, and then flown by helicopter into New York City's Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and Flores had been indicted in the Southern District of New York. The pair have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi wrote on X. Previously, Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.\n\nTrump told a news conference ahead of Maduro's arrival in New York: \"The oil business in Venezuela has been a bust, a total bust for a long period of time. \"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\" The South American country has approximately 303 billion barrels' worth of crude, accounting for about 20% of the world's oil resources, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: \"We are going to run the country\"\n\nIt is unclear exactly how the US plans to \"run\" Venezuela, but the president said it will be a \"group\" of people leading the charge. \"We're going to be running it with a group, and we're going to make sure it's run properly,\" Trump said. When pressed by reporters as to who inside Venezuela would form part of that group, Trump said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been talking to Delcy Rodríguez, the country's vice-president. Trump said Rodríguez - who has since been named interim president by Venezuela's Supreme Court - had expressed her willingness to do \"whatever the US asks\". However, speaking on state TV after Trump's remarks, Rodríguez called Maduro the \"only one president in Venezuela\", adding that the government was ready to defend itself. Trump also said he had not spoken to Venezuela's opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who was barred from last year's presidential election but was instrumental in galvanising support for a rival candidate to Maduro believed to have won the poll. The US president said Machado \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country\" needed to run Venezuela. Explosions were heard around Caracas early on Saturday morning as military bases were targeted by US forces. Over the following two hours and twenty minutes, dozens of US aircraft were seen in the skies as special forces penetrated Maduro's safe house to retrieve him.

Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\" that was \"deeply concerning and condemnable\". China's foreign ministry said it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Many Latin American countries, including Venezuela's neighbours, Colombia and Brazil, also condemned the actions. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel described them as a \"criminal attack\", while Trump's ally in Argentina, Javier Milei, wrote \"freedom moves forward\" on social media. US allies were more reserved in their responses, urging a peaceful transition of power. Sir Keir Starmer said the UK \"regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president\" and \"shed no tears about the end of his regime\", but called for a \"safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government\". The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas and France's president Emmanuel Macron offered similar sentiments calls for peace. A new government must be \"respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\", Macron wrote in a post on X.

On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will \"run\" Venezuela. The US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him \"we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice\". Trump was light on detail. He said that \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]\". But does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance? It sounded as if he believes something like that. The evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth. The respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela. The same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power. The removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power. The US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life.\n\nMaduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens. But the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders. The mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces. The military operation is only the first stage. America's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous. The political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process. Iraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021. Neither country was in America's backyard. Yet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising. Trump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. \"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\" He said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to \"watch his ass\". Later he told Fox News that \"something's going to have to be done with Mexico\". Cuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans. The US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America. I was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs. Donald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country. \"I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect.\" He did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections. Instead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. While there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact. It is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans. The military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose. Civilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups. They include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary.\n\nWatch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded\n\nThe US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview. He makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries. He has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance. Trump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised. \"We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement.\" That will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south. The US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:14:35 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T15:43:50.372523"}

Regional security and Beijing's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture are also on the agenda for Monday's meeting, which is their second summit since November, when Xi visited South Korea. Given what a vital economic partner China is, experts say Lee is looking for assurances that it would not weaponise that relationship in the face of political tensions in the region. For weeks, China and Japan have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the former's claim on self-governed Taiwan, which puts Seoul, a key regional power, in an awkward spot.\n\nBeijing ramped up the rhetoric against Japan after its prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self defence force in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. So visiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee. Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence. Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will attend a banquet hosted by Xi on Monday. He will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai. Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\". This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China. On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC. \"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\" Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan. While Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park added. Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi.

His comments to US magazine The Atlantic came as the country's deposed president Nicolás Maduro was set to appear in a New York court on Monday. The US accuses Maduro, who is charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences, of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime, a claim he denies. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted the US is not at war with Venezuela, after air strikes in Caracas on Saturday led to Maduro and his wife being taken into custody and transported to the US.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers said the operation was an \"act of war\". In an interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, Trump said of Rodríguez: \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\" He added that for Venezuela,\"Regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can't get any worse\".\n\nDonald Trump Trump posted a picture of Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima after his arrest\n\nOn Saturday, Trump had vowed the US would \"run\" the country until \"a safe and proper and judicious transition\" was possible. Trump also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country\". Despite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge. The Cuban government has said 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" died when US forces attacked and captured Maduro and his wife. Cuba - a longstanding socialist ally of Maduro - has announced two days of national mourning.\n\nIn several TV interviews on Sunday morning, Rubio defended the US's military operation in Venezuela, stressing the action did not mean the US is at war with the South American country. \"We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That's not a war against Venezuela,\" Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning. The secretary of state also told CBS that if Venezuela doesn't \"make the right decisions\", the US \"will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected\". That includes the \"quarantine\" the US has placed on Venezuela's oil, he said. \"We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do,\" he added. Trump also threatened Venezuela's neighbour Colombia, in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One. He did not rule out military action against Colombia, saying \"it sounds good to me\", and called Colombian President Gustavo Petro \"a sick man\". \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump said.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Armed police officers stand in front of the Metropolitan Detention facility in the Brooklyn borough of New York, where ousted president Nicolás Maduro is being held.\n\nMaduro, who leads the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at their compound and flown to the US, as part of a dramatic special forces operation in the early hours of Saturday that also saw strikes on military bases. The couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday. Maduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil. While US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team and \"soldiers and innocent civilians\" were killed in the US operation. When asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it \"wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion\". He described it as a \"law enforcement operation\", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents. You can't notify Congress of an operation like this because \"it will leak\", he added. Maduro's vice president Delcy Rodríguez is now the interim president after being sworn in by the nation's Supreme Court. The country's military has also given its backing to her. She will be sworn in as president on Monday in Caracas, at 08:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Speaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela. He answered that \"this is not about the legitimate president\" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas on Saturday", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:11:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T04:11:00.992165"}

He's followed through on threats against Venezuela by capturing its president and his wife from their heavily fortified Caracas compound in a dramatic overnight raid. When describing the operation, Trump dusted off the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the western hemisphere - re-branding it the \"Donroe Doctrine\". Here are some of the warnings he's made against other nations in Washington's orbit in recent days.\n\nGreenland\n\nThe US already has a military base on Greenland - Pituffik Space Base - but Trump wants the whole island. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security\", he told journalists, saying the region was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\" The vast Arctic island, part of the Kingdom of Denmark, sits roughly 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to the north-east of the US. It's rich in rare earth minerals, which are crucial for the production of smart phones, electric vehicles and military hardware. Currently, China's production of rare earths far outweighs that of the US. Greenland also occupies a key strategic location in the North Atlantic, giving access to the increasingly important Arctic circle. As polar ices melt in the coming years, new shipping routes are expected to open up. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded to Trump by describing the notion of US control over the island as a \"fantasy\". \"No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation. We are open to dialogue. We are open to discussions. But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law,\" he said.\n\nColombia\n\nJust hours after the operation in Venezuela, Trump warned Colombian President Gustavo Petro to \"watch his ass\". Venezuela's neighbour to the west, Colombia is home to substantial oil reserves and is a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. It is also a key hub for the region's drug trade - most notably cocaine. Since the US began striking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific in September - saying, without evidence, they were carrying drugs - Trump has been locked in a spiralling dispute with the country's left-wing president. The US imposed sanctions on Petro in October, saying he was allowing cartels to \"flourish\". Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said Colombia was being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States\". \"He's not going to be doing it for very long\", he said. Asked whether the US would carry out an operation targeting Colombia, Trump replied, \"It sounds good to me\". Historically, Colombia has been a close ally in Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter cartels.\n\nIran\n\nIran is currently facing mass anti-government protests, and Trump warned overnight that the authorities there would be \"hit very hard\" if more protesters died. \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States,\" he told reporters on Air Force One. Iran theoretically falls outside the scope defined in the \"Donroe Doctrine\", but Trump has nonetheless previously threatened the Iranian regime with further action, after striking its nuclear facilities last year. Those strikes came after Israel launched a large-scale operation aimed at decapitating Iran's capability to develop a nuclear weapon, which culminated in the 12-day Israel-Iran conflict. In a Mar-a-Lago meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, Iran was said to be top of the agenda. US media also reported that Netanyahu raised the potential of new strikes against Iran in 2026.\n\nMexico\n\nTrump's rise to power in 2016 was defined by his calls to \"Build the Wall\" along the southern border with Mexico. On his first day back in office in 2025, he signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\". He has frequently claimed Mexican authorities aren't doing enough to stop the flow of drugs or illegal immigrants into the US. Speaking on Sunday, he said that drugs were \"pouring\" through Mexico and \"we're gonna have to do something\", adding that the cartels there were \"very strong.\" Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected any US military action on Mexican soil.\n\nCuba", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 04:19:13 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T07:31:59.445714"}

The two nations have shared a political vision of state-led socialism since a fresh-faced Venezuelan presidential candidate, Hugo Chávez, met the aged leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, on the tarmac at Havana airport in 1999. For years, their mutual ties only deepened, as Venezuelan crude oil flowed to the communist-run island in exchange for Cuban doctors and medics travelling in the other direction. After the deaths of the two men, it was Nicolás Maduro - trained and instructed in Cuba - who became Chávez's handpicked successor, chosen partly because he was acceptable to the Castro brothers. He represented continuity for the Cuban revolution as much as the Venezuelan one. Now he, too, is gone from the seat of power in Caracas, forcibly removed by the US's elite Delta Force team. The prospects for Cuba in his absence are bleak. For now, the Cuban government has robustly denounced the attack as illegal and declared two days of national mourning for 32 Cuban nationals killed in the US military operation. Their deaths revealed a key fact long-known about Cuban influence over the Venezuelan presidency and military: Maduro's security detail was almost entirely made up of Cuban bodyguards. Cuban nationals are in place in numerous positions in Venezuela's intelligence services and military too. Cuba had long denied having active soldiers or security agents inside Venezuela, but freed political prisoners have often claimed they were interrogated by men with Cuban accents while in custody. Furthermore, despite endless public proclamations of solidarity between the two nations, in truth the Cuban influence behind the scenes of the Venezuelan state is believed to have driven a wedge between ministers most closely aligned with Havana and those who feel that the relationship first established by Chávez and Castro has become fundamentally unbalanced. In essence, that faction considers that these days Venezuela gets little in return for its oil. Venezuela is believed to send around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba - none of the island's other main energy partners, Russia and Mexico, even come close.\n\nGetty Images Food shortages have worsened in Cuba as it grapples with a severe economic crisis\n\nThe Trump administration's tactic of confiscating sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers has already begun to worsen the fuel and electricity crisis in Cuba and has the potential to become very acute, very quickly. At best, the future looks increasingly complex for the beleaguered Caribbean island without Maduro at the helm in Caracas. Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War. There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months. And the impact on ordinary Cubans has been taxing in the extreme: weeks without reliable electricity, food rotting in fridges, fans and air-conditioning not running, mosquitoes swarming in the heat and the fester of uncollected rubbish. The island has experienced a widespread outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in recent weeks with huge numbers of people affected by dengue fever and chikungunya. Cuba's healthcare system, once the jewel in the revolution's crown, has struggled to cope. It is not a pretty picture. Yet it is the daily reality for most Cubans. The idea that the flow of Venezuelan oil to Cuba could be turned off by Delcy Rodríguez fills Cubans with dread, especially if she looks to placate the Trump administration following the US raid against her predecessor and stave off the spectre of more violence.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock\n\nPresident Trump insists Washington is calling the shots in Venezuela now. While those comments were walked back - to an extent - by his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, there is no doubt that the Trump administration now expects nothing less than total compliance from Rodríguez as acting president. There would be further, potentially worse consequences, Trump threatened, if she \"doesn't behave\", as he put it. Such language - not to mention the US operation in Venezuela itself - has shocked and angered Washington's critics, who say the White House is guilty of the worst form of US imperialism and interventionism seen in Latin America since the Cold War. The removal of Maduro from power amounted to kidnapping, those critics argue, and the case against him must be thrown out at his eventual trial in New York.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:41:36 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T08:39:19.221337"}

The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies. The batches were sold across the world, Nestle said, and they potentially contain cereulide, which can cause nausea and vomiting when consumed.

Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are taking part, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed. However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging.\n\nThe outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter. Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting.

Trump told NBC News that \"a tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they'll get reimbursed by us or through revenue\". Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration later this week, BBC's partner CBS News reported. Analysts previously told the BBC it could take tens of billions of dollars, and potentially a decade, to restore Venezuela's former output.\n\nTrump's remarks came days after he said the US would \"run\" Venezuela after the ousting of Maduro - who has now been brought to the US to face criminal charges. Speaking to NBC about his 18-month timeframe, Trump speculated that oil production could ramp up \"in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money\". He has been explicit about his ambitions for American petroleum companies to scale up their operations in the country. \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down,\" Trump added. The analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil. They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place, and even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years.\n\nTrump has claimed in recent days that American oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The country has an estimated 303 million barrels, the world's largest proven reserve. But it produces just a fraction of that amount, and its production has been in decline since the early 2000s. The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves. Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms. Additionally, Venezuelan oil is heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently working in the country. Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company \"remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets\". \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,\" Turenne added. Other major US energy companies Exxon and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and stole American oil\". Vice President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that \"Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities\". The reality is more complex. US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements. Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country. In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for this 2007 move. That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it. But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has \"stolen\" American oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:40:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:03:09.610652"}

Asked in an interview with CNN to confirm the US would rule out the use of force to annex the semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark, Stephen Miller said, \"nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\" On Sunday Trump repeated his insistence that the US \"needs\" Greenland - to the consternation of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who said an attack by the US would spell the end of Nato. Six European allies rallied to Denmark's support with a joint statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" read the statement by the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark. Stressing they were as keen as the US in Arctic security, the seven signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US \"collectively\" - whilst \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\". In his interview with CNN, Miller said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\". He went on: \"By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? What is their basis of claiming Greenland as a colony of Denmark?\" The top Trump aide also said the US \"is the power of Nato. For the US to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend Nato and Nato interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the US.\" Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks.\n\nThe issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time. He also said the US was returning to an 1823 policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere - and he warned a number of countries the US could turn its attention to them. In the wake of the Venezuela intervention, Miller's wife Katie posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word \"SOON\".\n\nIt has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic - something the US president has previously refused to rule out. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark. Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:38:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:03:09.791199"}

The BBC's analysis of protests includes only those for which we have verified video footage - the true number is almost certainly far higher. There are reports of protests in a further 11 provinces. The wave of protests has spread rapidly across Iran since 28 December, when anger initially broke out in the capital Tehran following a fresh and sharp devaluation of the country's currency against the dollar and other major foreign currencies. Verified footage from the last 10 days shows evidence of anti-government demonstrations and gatherings in more than 50 towns and cities across the country, including in several regions previously perceived as being highly loyal to the state.\n\nMore than 100 videos which which we geolocated and checked for publication date paint a picture of the scale of the unrest, with people taking to the streets in many major cities in Iran and presenting the largest challenge to the state since the Women, Life and Freedom protests in 2022. Footage has also shown protests in Qom in central Iran and Mashhad in the north-east, both of which have traditionally hosted populations extremely loyal to the Islamic Republic. Prof Sina Azodi, Director of Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University, said that unrest in those cities was \"very telling\" and amounted to evidence that the government's \"base of support is also suffering under the economic hardship\".\n\nAuthorities have traditionally used violence to crush unrest. During the 2022 protests - sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who had been detained in Tehran for wearing \"improper hijab\" - more than 550 people were allegedly killed by security forces, according to human rights groups. While the latest response by police and security forces initially appeared to be more restrained, verified footage has shown officers ramping up the use of force since Saturday. This change in approach coincided with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's first public reaction to the protests on that day, in which he said that \"rioters must be put in their place\". Since the supreme leader's remarks, Iran's judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said authorities would \"listen to protesters and critics who legitimately and rightly have concerns about their livelihood and social and economic welfare\". But he added that they would \"deal firmly with those who seek to exploit the situation, incite riots, and undermine the security of the country and the people\". The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has also issued warnings to protesters in Lorestan province that they will no longer tolerate street gatherings. BBC Persian has so far confirmed the identities of at least 11 people reported dead since 28 December using a combination of verified funeral videos and interviews with family members and friends. Foreign-based human rights group HRANA says at least 35 people have so far been killed in the unrest, including two affiliated with security forces.\n\nOne of the most violent crackdowns happened in Malekshahi, a small town in the western province of Ilam, on Saturday. Verified footage showed a small demonstration taking place at Commandery Boulevard, where the officers of several state institutions are located, before gunfire appeared to break out. Human rights groups said four people were killed in the incident, with the semi-official Mehr and Tasnim news agencies putting the figure at three dead. Later footage showed a number of people being transported to hospital. It was unclear from the footage what condition those seen in the footage were in.

Iran's president has ordered an investigation into the incident. Experts warned that the security forces heavy-handed response could exacerbate the challenges facing the government. \"Escalating repression is likely to deepen popular resentment toward the political system while risking fatigue and demoralisation within the police and security forces - who, at some point, may cease to comply with orders,\" Peyman Jafari, assistant professor of international relations at the US-based College of William and Mary, told BBC Verify.

Another dramatic clip showed a security officer on a motorbike set ablaze by a demonstrator wielding an improvised flamethrower after security forces violently detained and beat up a protester. It is unclear what happened to the officer, as the footage cut off, while other officers gave chase to the demonstrator who fled on foot.

Officials have also been accused of widespread corruption. But in recent days the demonstrations have taken an anti-state tone, with protesters in numerous locations chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the clerical establishment that has been ruling the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Verified videos have also shown chants in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the Shah of Iran, and the pre-1979 revolution Pahlavi dynasty. At the University of Tehran, some protesters chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Khamenei - as dozens of demonstrators flooded through the institution's main gate on 30 December.

After all, last June he co-ordinated the daring \"Spider Web\" attack, which saw more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russian territory. Khmara, his replacement, was also involved in the preparation of that operation.\n\nSo it did not come as a surprise that Malyuk's dismissal earlier this week was widely criticised within Ukraine, including by several high-profile military commanders. The impression that the decision made by President Zelensky was short-sighted was cemented by reports that Malyuk had initially refused to step down voluntarily.\n\nAlthough he has been dismissed from the position of SBU chief, he has been asked to continue leading special operations against Russia. Ukraine needed more \"asymmetric operations against Russian forces\", Zelensky said, adding that Malyuk was \"best at this\".\n\nKhmara's appointment has gone some way in quelling fears about the SBU's future effectiveness. But former SBU operative Ivan Stupak argues his reputation - though solid - is limited to a certain sphere and that it is unclear whether he will be able to translate his experience to running the wider SBU.\n\nStupak also believes that Malyuk's dismissal is connected with the appointment of former spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as Zelensky's new chief of staff.\n\n\"Malyuk and Budanov are at loggerheads,\" he told the BBC, implying that Budanov had heavily influenced Zelensky's decision and that Khmara would now be \"in the hands\" of Budanov.\n\nOther analysts disagree. Oleksandr Notevskyi, of the Ukrainian Center for Policy Development, praised Khmara's appointment, pointing out his successes in heading Alpha, one of the top elite divisions of the SBU: \"He's young, he's experienced, he is one of the authors of the Spider Web operation.\"\n\nIn a statement, the SBU described Khmara as a decorated and \"experienced special-purpose officer\" who was involved in liberating the Kyiv region in 2022 and fighting the Russians in the occupied region of Donetsk.\n\nKhmara's appointment will need to be confirmed by the Ukrainian parliament, which may yet reject it. Other options are on the table, Notevskyi said.\n\nAfter nearly four years of war, Ukraine is struggling to push back Russian forces in the conventional way - on the battlefield and along the long front line in the east of the country. It has had more success targeting oil fields, weapons factories and - as in the case of the Spider Web attack - air bases and valuable aircraft.\n\nAt this particular juncture of the war with Moscow, Notevskyi argued, \"whoever leads the security service should be someone who is specialised in eliminating Russia's military capacities on the territory of Russia\".\n\nLast week, Zelensky announced significant changes to his top team. Mikhaylo Fedorov was nominated as new defence minister, while foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko replaced Budanov.\n\nMany of Zelensky's reshuffles have been criticised by commentators as damaging to the country at a time of crisis.\n\nUsing a football analogy, Stupak argued that Zelensky was like a manager going to the substitute bench for replacements. \"But his bench is quite short, and he's running out of people to use again and again,\" he said.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:26:46 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T14:53:37.619188"}

The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would \"run\" Venezuela.\n\nThe union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas. At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service. They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta. The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. The union called the incidents \"alarming\" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country.\n\nThe repression has not been confined to media workers. One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were \"hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses\". Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as \"colectivos\", wearing masks. A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was \"so much fear in the streets and in our homes\".

Two US officials told the broadcaster that American forces plan to intercept the ship, which historically has carried Venezuelan crude oil and is thought to be between Scotland and Iceland. President Donald Trump said last month that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, a move the government there described as \"theft\". Ahead of his seizure of the country's former leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Trump had repeatedly accused Venezuela's government of using ships to bring drugs to American shores.\n\nThe US coastguard tried to board the Bella 1 last month in the Caribbean when it was believed to be heading towards Venezuela. They had obtained a warrant to seize the ship, accused of breaking US sanctions and shipping Iranian oil. It then dramatically changed course, as well as its name to the Marinera, reportedly reflagging from a Guyanan to a Russian vessel. Its approach to Europe has coincided with the arrival of around 10 US military transport aircraft in the UK as well as helicopters. Russia says it is \"monitoring with concern\" the situation around the ship. CBS News reported that the two US officials said American forces preferred to seize the ship rather than sink it. The Marinera is believed to be between Scotland and Iceland, with the distance and weather making a boarding difficult. If any US military operation were to be launched from the UK then Washington would be expected to inform its ally. For now the UK Ministry of Defence says it will not comment on other nations' military activities.

The White House told the BBC that acquiring Greenland - a semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark – was a \"national security priority\". The statement came hours after European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark, which has been pushing back against Trump's ambitions for the Arctic island. Trump repeated over the weekend that the US \"needed\" Greenland for security reasons, prompting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to warn that any attack by the US would spell the end of Nato.\n\nThe White House said on Tuesday: \"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal.\" Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks. On Tuesday, six European allies expressed support for Denmark. \"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US in Arctic security, the European signatories of the joint statement said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US \"collectively\". They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".\n\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen welcomed the statement and called for \"respectful dialogue\". \"The dialogue must take place with respect for the fact that Greenland's status is rooted in international law and the principle of territorial integrity,\" Nielsen said. The issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. A day after that raid, Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides - posted a map on social media of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word \"SOON\". On Monday, her husband, Stephen Miller, said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\". Asked repeatedly in an interview with CNN whether America would rule out using force to annex it, Miller responded: \"Nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\"\n\nAn unnamed US senior official told Reuters news agency that the American options included the outright purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory. In response, a state department spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday that the US \"is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland\". \"Our common adversaries have been increasingly active in the Arctic. That is a concern that the United States, the Kingdom of Denmark, and NATO Allies share,\" the spokesperson said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also told lawmakers at a classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Monday that the Trump administration did not plan to invade Greenland, but mentioned buying it from Denmark, the Wall Street Journal reports. Greenland and Denmark previously said they had asked to meet Rubio quickly to discuss the American claims on the island. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said speaking with America's top diplomat should resolve \"certain misunderstandings\". Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, emphasised the national security aspect when he spoke to the BBC on Tuesday. \"I think they're just in talks right now,\" he said. \"My hope is that Europe would understand that a strong America is good - it's good for Western civilisation.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Schmitt to the BBC: It's \"important\" US moves forward with acquiring Greenland\n\nTrump floated his idea of acquiring Greenland as a strategic US hub in the Arctic during his first presidential term, saying in 2019: \"Essentially it's a large real estate deal.\" There is growing interest from Russia and China in the island, which has untapped rare earth deposits, as melting ice raises the possibility of new trade routes. In March, Trump said America would \"go as far as we have to go\" to get control of the territory.

There has been no comment from either Col Damiba or Ivory Coast.\n\nSince seizing power, Capt Traoré has faced at least two coup attempts and is also grappling with growing jihadist violence that has forced millions from their homes. Despite these challenges and his authoritarian reputation, the 37-year-old military leader maintains strong popular support and has gained a following across the continent for his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence.\n\nAccording to the security minister, the authorities uncovered a leaked video showing the plotters discussing their plans. In the footage they allegedly spoke about how they intended to assassinate the president - either at close range or by planting explosives at his residence - just after 23:00 local time on Saturday 3 January. Afterwards they allegedly planned to target other senior military and civilian figures. Sana alleged that Damiba had mobilised both soldiers and civilian supporters, secured foreign funding - most significantly 70m CFA francs ($125,000; £92,000) delivered from Ivory Coast - and planned to knock out the country's drone-launch base before foreign forces could intervene. \"We are carrying out ongoing investigations and have made several arrests. These individuals will be brought to justice soon,\" the minister said on national television. Sana insisted the situation was under control and urged citizens \"not to be misled, out of naivety, into dangerous schemes\". It is not clear how many people have been arrested. Critics, both local and foreign, have accused Traoré of authoritarianism and say his government suppresses dissent - including arbitrary arrests of military officers and restrictions on the media. It is not the first time the junta has pointed the finger of blame about foreign interference in its affairs at Ivory Coast. These continuing internal power struggles will further heighten regional tensions. Col Damiba served as Burkina Faso's leader from January-September 2022 after seizing power from an elected government. After being ousted, he said in a message published on social media that he wished his successor every success.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:17:56 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T11:29:26.019008"}

The presidential honour guard is the military force which provides the bodyguards tasked with protecting the head of state. While the Venezuelan government has not yet provided a detailed breakdown of casualties, members of the guard are thought to be among the dozens of people killed in the US operation to seize Maduro. The order to replace Gen Marcano Tábata was issued by the new interim president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nRodríguez was sworn in by the National Assembly, which is dominated by government loyalists, on Monday. She served as Maduro's vice-president and is considered to be a close ally of the jailed leader. US President Donald Trump said in the news conference following Maduro's seizure that the United States would \"run\" Venezuela and that the US was talking to Rodríguez. He also threatened that Rodríguez would face a \"fate worse than Maduro's\" if she did not comply with US demands, including those for oil, of which Venezuela has the world's largest proven reserves. On Tuesday, the US president said that Venezuela would be \"turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, but Venezuela's interim government has yet to comment on that statement. Rodríguez's tone has been alternating between defiant and conciliatory since she was designated interim president by Venezuela's Supreme Court. She denounced the seizure of Maduro as an \"illegal kidnapping\" but has also said that her government had \"invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation\". Her actions are being watched closely both inside and outside of Venezuela to gauge what course she may steer now that she is in charge of the country and for signs of any potential rifts in her government.\n\nThe sacking of Gen Marcano Tábata is one of the first changes to senior officials in her inner circle. As well as being in charge of the presidential guard, Gen Marcano Tábata also led Venezuela's military counterintelligence unit DGCIM. The DGCIM has played a key role in the repression of people critical of the Maduro government, according to the United Nations. A UN Independent Fact-Finding Mission found that the counterintelligence unit had committed myriad human rights violations since 2013. It documented scores of cases in which those detained were subjected to \"torture, sexual violence and/or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\" in the DGCIM headquarters and a network of covert detention centres across the country However, his sacking does not appear to be related to the repression carried out by the DGCIM under his helm as the man she has appointed to succeed him headed an intelligence service which faces similar accusations. Gustavo González López was in charge of Venezuela's national intelligence service, Sebin for many years. The Sebin controls the notorious Helicoide prison in Caracas, where the UN documented abuses being carried out against \"opposition politicians, journalists, protesters, and human rights defenders\".\n\nVenezuelan analysts think that Gen Marcano Tábata's dismissal is more likely to be related to the failure of the presidential honour guard to prevent the seizure of Maduro. Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela which has long provided security and intelligence services to Maduro, said that 32 of its nationals had been killed in the US raid. Many of them are thought to have been embedded in the presidential honour guard.\n\nWatch: What's at the heart of Cuba and Venezuela's relationship?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:50:10 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T16:00:05.914942"}

US forces boarded the Russian-flagged Marinera after a pursuit lasting almost two weeks and as it travelled through the waters between Iceland and Scotland. The British Navy gave logistical support by air and sea. A second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was accused by the US of \"conducting illicit activities\" and boarded in the Caribbean. The moves come as the US seeks to choke off most exports of Venezuelan crude oil, and just days after its special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a lighting raid on his residence in Caracas.\n\nIn a post on X, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote: \"The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT - anywhere in the world.\" Moscow has denounced the seizure of the tanker sailing under its flag, and demanded that the US treat Russians on board properly and permits them to return to Russia quickly. The transport ministry said it had given the vessel \"temporary permission\" to use the Russian flag, adding that no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions. Reports had suggested that Russia had dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel, but it appears that US forces were able to board the tanker without facing any resistance. The White House described the ship as a \"Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel deemed stateless after flying a false flag and had a judicial order\" against it.\n\nVenezuela's leadership is co-operating with the US on the second tanker seized in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. \"They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they co-operate and work with the United States,\" Rubio told reporters. Earlier, US President Donald Trump had said that Venezuela - which has the world's largest oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US. Rubio said that the US would sell oil that is in Venezuela \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\". He said the US had a considered plan for the future of Venezuela, and that the administration was \"not just winging it\".

The White House has said it was \"actively\" discussing an offer to buy the territory that has for centuries belonged to Denmark. US President Donald Trump and his officials had earlier intimated a willingness to take it by force if necessary. This has been met with nervousness and opprobrium among Greenlanders - both on the world's largest island and elsewhere. This nervousness has only grown since the US took Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro from his residence in Caracas to New York on drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in an unprecedented military move. Almost immediately after, the wife of a senior White House staffer indicated that Greenland was next. \"That's when it stopped feeling abstract,\" says Tupaarnaq Kopeck, 40, who moved to Canada - another place Trump has threatened to annex - for family and work. \"For the first time, I contacted my sister in Greenland and told her that if the unthinkable ever became reality, they would have a place to stay with us.\" Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, says the comments from the Trump administration are \"a clear threat\" that she was \"appalled\" by. \"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she says.\n\nTupaarnaq Kopeck Tupaarnaq Kopeck says the military intervention in Venezuela made the abstract feel real\n\nGreenland is the world's most sparsely populated territory. With much of the Arctic island covered by ice, most of the population lives in Nuuk and the surrounding south-western coastline. But it is strategically significant to the US - which is why it has had a military presence there since World War 2. Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks. More recently, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. \"It's not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats - if you can call them that - from a giant like the US,\" says Masaana Egede, Editor in Chief from Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. \"The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.\" Experts generally agree that a military takeover of Greenland would be an easy undertaking for the US - but that the geopolitical fallout would effectively end the Nato alliance. After the issue of Greenland's ownership was raised anew by the White House, six European allies issued a statement saying Greenland's future should be decided by its people - something Mia says she is grateful for. But she worries this will matter little to the US \"if it's not backed with consequences and actions\". \"As a Greenlander, I can't help but wonder: what are we worth to these allies? To what lengths are they willing to go to protect us?\" Tupaarnaq says: \"Respect is about more than alliances on paper. When powerful nations talk about you instead of with you, that respect disappears very quickly.\"\n\nAleqatsiaq Peary Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter says a US takeover would just \"replace one occupier with another\"\n\nThe Trump administration has stressed its intention was to buy Greenland from Denmark - despite Copenhagen reiterating the territory was not for sale - while retaining a military intervention as an option. Aaja sees annexation by force as unlikely - instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\". Polling consistently shows that Greenlanders generally favour eventual independence from Denmark but oppose being owned by the US. The territory is largely self-governing, with control of foreign affairs and defence retained by Copenhagen. This is perhaps why Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in the remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, seemed unfazed by the prospect of US ownership. \"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he says. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\" But he says: \"I don't have time for Trump. Our people are in need,\" explaining hunters like him hunt with dogs on the sea ice and fish, \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".

Trump administration officials claim the woman, identified as Renee Nicole Good, was a \"violent rioter\" attempting to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents when one agent fired \"defensive shots\" into her vehicle. But city and state leaders, and Democrats nationally, are disputing that account. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey claims that \"this was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying\", telling ICE agents: \"Get out of our city.\"\n\nMultiple videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time. From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis. A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the sidewalk area. Multiple law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. Immigration agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, get out of the truck and order the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. It's not clear exactly where the officer is standing based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC. That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off. Three pops are heard, and the vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a white car parked along the street nearby.

The shooting comes amid a major immigration crackdown in Minneapolis by the Trump administration. US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said the deceased woman's actions constituted \"domestic terrorism\" - and that ICE's operations in the city will continue. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that an ICE officer was \"viciously\" run over. \"It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,\" he wrote. The president also blamed the \"Radical Left\" for \"threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis\". Speaking to press later in the day, Noem called the loss of life \"preventable\". But she repeatedly claimed that the ICE agent fired in self-defence and that Good used her vehicle as a \"deadly weapon\" against agents. The details are pending an FBI investigation she said, adding that the same agent injured Wednesday was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June. The Minneapolis City Council, however, said that Good was simply \"caring for her neighbors\" when she was shot and killed.\n\nGetty Images Law enforcement surrounds the area where an ICE agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis\n\nMinnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident. \"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\" Top Democrats, like former Vice President Kamala Harris and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements Wednesday evening. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events \"gaslighting\". Protests erupted in several parts of the city as outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave. According to local media reports, the main gathering happened near the scene of the shooting. A makeshift vigil, displaying flowers and candles, was laid in the snow there, as protesters chanted slogans and delivered speeches. One group of protesters formed a line blocking the entrance to a federal courthouse with ICE officers standing inside, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The group of around 50 people chanted Good's name and dispersed after breaking a glass window. Protests are also taking place in cities outside Minneapolis, with gatherings expected in New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.\n\nWhy is ICE in Minneapolis?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 02:07:47 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T03:51:11.273241"}

What is it about Delcy Rodríguez, daughter of a former Marxist guerilla and deputy to ousted dictator Nicolas Maduro, that has caught the eye of the Trump administration? And why has Washington decided on an avowed \"Chavista\" revolutionary to stay in power, rather than backing the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, whose opposition movement is widely believed to have won the 2024 presidential elections? The answer, according to one former US ambassador to Venezuela, is simple. \"They've gone for stability over democracy,\" says Charles Shapiro, who served as George W Bush's ambassador in Caracas from 2002-04. \"They've kept the dictatorial regime in place without the dictator. The henchmen are still there.\" \"I think it's risky as hell.\" But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro.\n\nWatch: \"I want a president who's involved\" - Michiganders weigh in on Maduro's seizure\n\nIn his dramatic press conference on Saturday morning, President Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as \"not respected\" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as \"gracious.\" \"I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,\" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says. \"Her movement was massively elected…and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement.\" The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice president might have been in on the plan. \"I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,\" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran. \"It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself.\" But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies. \"Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,\" Gunson says. Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability. In October, an ICG report warned that \"Washington should beware of regime change.\" \"The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,\" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities.

The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future. \"It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration, says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas Program at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies. But the challenges, he says, have only just begun. \"The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals…are going to take much more time to come to fruition. For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with. \"She's been a bit of an economic reformer,\" Gunson says. \"She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital.\"\n\nWatch: The key questions on Trump’s actions on Venezuela", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:20:37 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T05:13:28.494545"}

The US Africa Command branch of the US military said on 25 December that its “initial assessment is that multiple Isis terrorists were killed in the Isis camps”.\n\nMalik Samuel, a researcher with Good Governance Africa, said he had spoken to a Lakurawa member who said about 100 fighters were killed in a forest camp in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state. He said he was told that about 200 were missing, with many of the remaining fighters now trying to cross into Niger. This could not be independently confirmed.\n\nView image in fullscreen The effects of an airstrike in Offa, Nigeria. It is not known how many fighters were killed despite Donald Trump hailing ‘numerous perfect strikes’. Photograph: Abiodun Jamiu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nResidents of Nukuru, a village about 6 miles from the reported camp, told the BBC that fighters on about 15 motorcycles had fled through the community, riding three to a bike.\n\nMissile debris fell on empty farmland about 60 miles south in the town of Jabo, which local people said had never been attacked by Lakurawa. Debris also reportedly damaged a hotel 500 miles south of Tangaza, injuring three workers.\n\nIt remains unclear why the US specifically targeted Lakurawa, which operates in a rural, underdeveloped and almost entirely Muslim area in the north-west near the Niger border. Most violence in the area is perpetrated by armed gangs known as bandits.\n\nTrump had previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to stop the killing of Christians, an important theme for his evangelical base. Two US officials told the New York Times that the airstrikes were a one-off aimed at allowing Trump to claim he was going after a group that had killed Christians.\n\nView image in fullscreen A screengrab of an X post by the US Department of Defense showing a missile launch. Photograph: US Department of Defense/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMurtala Abdullahi, a Nigerian security consultant, also said Lakurawa was probably a symbolic target. “How do you establish a link that [a] bandit group has been hitting the Christian community?” he asked. “That’s difficult. But if you hit a jihadist group then you don’t need to establish a link.”\n\nAbdullahi said he did not know why the US had chosen to hit Lakurawa rather than Boko Haram, which is far more notorious internationally and attacks both Christians and Muslims.\n\nSince the airstrikes, global attention around Trump’s unpredictable, militarised foreign policy has turned to Venezuela, where US forces abducted Nicolás Maduro on 3 January, and Greenland, where Trump and other senior US officials have expressed renewed interest in a US takeover.\n\nVery little is known conclusively about Lakurawa, from the year it started to the number of fighters. Even the meaning of its name, which some analysts say is a Hausa pronunciation of “les recrues” (“the recruits” in French), is not an agreed fact.\n\nNigeria designated the group as a terrorist organisation in January 2025. Some analysts say the group is linked to Islamic State’s Sahel branch. However, Samuel said he had interviewed Lakurawa members who professed loyalty to al-Qaida.\n\nResearchers agree that the group’s senior members are from Mali or Nigeria. Local people in Sokoto state report that fighters speak Hausa with a foreign accent and a different language among themselves.\n\nIn about 2017, Lakurawa was invited by some local communities to protect them against bandits. However, the group has since turned to violent methods similar to those of the bandits, as well as enforcing their extreme version of Islam.\n\n“That coercive authority that they started asserting turned communities against them,” said Kato Van Broeckhoven, a United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research researcher.\n\nView image in fullscreen The effects of an airstrike in Jabo, Nigeria.

Just last week, gunmen killed more than 30 people in Niger state, in the centre-west of Nigeria, and abducted an unknown number of people. Local people told reporters they included students from a Catholic school where 300 pupils and teachers were kidnapped in November and only freed in December.\n\n“Why is Nigeria a fertile ground for all these groups to come in and operate?” Samuel said. “It is simple: because of governance issues … You see clearly the level of poverty in these places, you see clearly the absence of the state, the vacuum that has been created.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:03 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T05:13:28.951763"}

The tents that now serve as classrooms are noisy and a little chaotic but lively. Some teachers point to boards covered in English letters; others invite pupils to come forward and write basic Arabic words. It is nowhere near a normal school day. But after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in October, it's a start. After two years of war, the hum of lessons and chatter of classmates resonates around the ruins of what was once Lulwa Abdel Wahab al-Qatami School, in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in the south-western part of Gaza City. It was hit in January 2024, and for months afterwards, its grounds served as a shelter for displaced families. Today, it is again a place of learning - albeit in a more basic form. Walking in a straight line, their small arms resting on each other's shoulders, pupils smile as they head into the makeshift classrooms. For many, this is the first return to routine and education since the war began. According to Unicef, more than 97% of schools in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the war. The IDF has made repeated claims that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure including schools to carry out operations but has rarely provided solid evidence. Of the Strip's 658,000 school-aged children, most have had no formal education for nearly two years. During that time, many learned first-hand how hunger, displacement and death can shape their young lives. Now, something rare is emerging: a fragile glimpse of the childhoods they once knew.\n\nFor many children at this school, it's the first return to education since the war began\n\nFourteen-year-old Naeem al-Asmaar used to attend this school before it was destroyed. He lost his mother in an Israeli air strike during the war. \"It was the hardest thing I've ever been through,\" he says quietly. Although he was displaced for months, Naeem's home in Gaza City survived. After the ceasefire, he returned with his family. \"I missed being in school a lot,\" Naeem said adding that the difference is stark. \"Before the war, school was in real classrooms,\" \"Now it's tents. We only study four subjects. There isn't enough space. The education is not the same - but being here matters. School fills all my time and I really needed that.\" Rital Alaa Harb, a ninth-grade student who once studied here too, wants to become a dentist. \"Displacement affected my education completely,\" she says. \"There was no time to study. No schools. I missed my friends so much - and I miss my old school.\" The makeshift school is run by Unicef and brings together children from the original Lulwa school and others displaced by the war. It does not teach the full Palestinian curriculum - only the basics: Arabic, English, mathematics and science. The principal, Dr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber, has worked in education for 24 years. He took over management of the site in mid-November. \"We started with determination,\" he said, \"to compensate students for what they lost.\"\n\nDr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber says many of the children are struggling with trauma\n\nThe school currently serves 1,100 boys and girls, operating in three shifts a day - with boys attending on alternating days from girls. There are just 24 teachers. \"Before the war,\" Dr Schheiber says, \"our students learned in fully equipped schools - science labs, computer labs, internet access, educational resources. All of that is gone.\" There is no electricity here. No internet. And many children are struggling with trauma. More than 100 students at the school lost one or both parents, had their homes destroyed, or witnessed killings during the war. In total, Dr Schheiber says, every student has been affected - directly or indirectly. A counsellor now runs psychological support sessions, trying to help children process what they have endured. Despite the effort, demand far exceeds capacity. \"We have more than a thousand students here already,\" Dr Schheiber says. \"But only six classrooms per shift. There is a large displacement camp next to the school - families from northern and eastern Gaza. Many children want to enrol. We simply cannot take them.\"\n\nMany parents say their children have lost years of education\n\nFor parents, the return to school brings relief as well as anxiety. Huda Bassam al-Dasouki, a mother of five displaced from southern Rimal, says education has become an overwhelming challenge. \"It's not that education doesn't exist,\" she says. \"It's that it's extremely difficult.\" Even before the war, schools struggled with shortages, she says. Now, basic supplies are unaffordable or unavailable. \"A notebook that cost one shekel ($0.31; £0.23) before the war now costs five,\" she says. \"I have five children.\" Some children, she says, have fallen four years behind, including time lost during the Covid pandemic. \"My son can't read.

Chen Zhi was among three Chinese nationals arrested on 6 January after a joint investigation into transnational crime lasting several months, Cambodia said. The US charged the 37-year-old last October with running internet scams from Cambodia that it said had stolen billions in cryptocurrency. The UK also sanctioned his global business empire, Prince Group. Cambodian authorities have also suspended the operations of Prince Bank, a subsidiary of Prince Group.\n\nThe bank has been placed under liquidation and banned from offering new banking services - though customers can still withdraw money and repay loans, the National Bank of Cambodia said on Thursday. Last year, US authorities seized about $15bn (£11bn) worth of bitcoin that alleged belonged to Chen, in what FBI Director Kash Patel described as \"one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history\". The BBC contacted Prince Group for comment at the time. In the past, the Cambodia-based group has denied any involvement in scams. Its website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. Since Chen Zhi was indicted by the US on fraud and money-laundering charges in October, his whereabouts have been unclear. But on Wednesday, the Cambodian authorities said they had \"arrested three Chinese nationals namely Chen Zhi, Xu Ji Liang, and Shao Ji Hui and extradited [them] to the People's Republic of China\". The interior ministry statement did not say where Chen Zhi had been detained. His Cambodian nationality had been revoked by royal decree last month, it added. The enigmatic tycoon had given up his Chinese nationality to become a Cambodian citizen in 2014.\n\nThe UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia, many of them to Cambodia, lured by the promise of legitimate jobs and then forced to run online scams. People are held against their will in the scam farms and made to defraud strangers online under the threat of punishment or torture. Many of those trapped are Chinese and targeted people in China.\n\nEPA Scam centres have proliferated in South East Asia - above, people rescued from compounds in Myanmar last February are seen arriving in Thailand\n\nChinese authorities have also been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020.

The government has said little since the US and UK sanctioned Prince Group, apart from urging US and UK authorities to be sure they had sufficient evidence for their allegations. By some estimates, scam businesses may account for around half of the entire Cambodian economy. \"I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,\" Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who has investigated Chen Zhi, told the BBC last year.

Nine people were detained on Tuesday after police raided their homes and the church office in Chengdu, the Early Rain Covenant Church said. Five of them had been released by Wednesday. More than 1,000 miles away in Wenzhou, authorities began demolishing the Yayang Church building, as seen in video obtained by the non-profit ChinaAid, which monitors religious persecution. This latest wave of arrests, after others last year, shows the Communist Party's resolve to snuff out churches that do not align with its ideology, Christian groups say.\n\nThe BBC has contacted China's embassy in the UK for comment. Authorities have not made any statements about the arrests, or the demolition in Wenzhou. China promotes atheism and controls religion. The government said in 2018 there are 44 million Christians in the country, but it's unclear if that number includes those who attend the many underground churches. The Party has long pressured Christians to join only state-sanctioned churches led by government-approved pastors. But Christian groups say the grip has tightened noticeably, with arrests becoming more common and prompt. At least two church leaders in China have told the BBC that authorities are swiftly arresting unauthorised church leaders, while in the past, these individuals would first be warned, then fined and finally detained if they still refuse to comply with orders.\n\nGetty Images Under Xi Jinping, China has tightened its grip on religious freedom\n\nJust weeks ago, Li Yingqiang, the current leader of Early Rain Covenant Church, had said he \"sensed a storm gathering\" and referred to \"the imminent prospect of... another large-scale crackdown\". \"I dearly hope that none of our families shall ever again endure such a storm. Yet as an elder appointed by the Lord to stand among you... it is my duty to remind you all to prepare yourselves before the storm returns,\" he wrote in a letter to church members in November. Li and his wife Zhang Xinyue are among the four who remain in detention. Their church described the arrests as a \"concerted operation\" but said the grounds for arrest, and whether those detained have been charged, remain unclear. It added that it had lost contact with two other members but did not say they had been detained. \"The situation is ongoing, with specific details yet to be fully confirmed,\" Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) said in a statement to members and supporters. It also also sought prayers for its members' safety and their perseverance in the Christian faith. In Wenzhou, local authorities brought in bulldozers, cranes and heavy machinery earlier this week, and started taking down part of the Yayang Church building, as seen in the video. ChinaAid said it was told by multiple sources that hundreds of armed and special police officers have been deployed to stand guard outside the building. Sometimes known as \"the Jerusalem of China\", Wenzhou has more Christians than any other city in the country. Residents living near Yayang Church have been \"driven away\", while those working in the area has been instructed not to take photographs or record video, ChinaAid said. \"The massive mobilisation against the two major independent church networks shows the central government is determined to stamp out Christian churches entirely, unless the church is totally indoctrinated into the party's ideology,\" said Bob Fu, who founded ChinaAid.\n\nChinaAid Local authorities have started taking down part of Yayang Church's building", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:01:19 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T12:58:18.061472"}

Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance.\n\nBoth Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale.

The accord follows complaints that religious leaders had failed to tackle the issue adequately. It means the government will manage possible compensation in co-ordination with the Church, handling cases where other legal avenues are no longer available because the alleged crime took place too long ago or the individual accused has passed away. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered.\n\n\"A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up,\" said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement. He added that the agreement sought to \"pay off an historic, moral debt that we had with victims of abuse within the Church\". The other signatories were Luis Argüello, president of the Episcopal Conference and leader of the Spanish Catholic Church, and Jesús Díaz Sariego, president of Confer, which represents Catholic congregations and religious orders. Mr Sariego said the initiative was unprecedented as it tackled crimes that had gone past the statute of limitations. Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as \"another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling\".\n\nA 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people. The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church.\n\nIn November, the Church said that 58 cases had been \"resolved\" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s. Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid.\n\nEPA Pope Francis apologised many times about the scandal that shook the Catholic Church\n\nUnder the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman. Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution. The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified. However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries. In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as \"too small\".

People have taken to the streets of Minneapolis to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Good, who died on Wednesday after being shot in her car. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials from involvement in the case, but the US vice-president said the investigation is a federal issue. Officials have offered differing accounts of the incident, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would investigate the incident. Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said the FBI had initially agreed to a joint investigation with state officials but then reversed course and denied the state access to materials and evidence.

Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard. The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. At the scene of the crash on Thursday, blood from the shooting could still be seen in the snow. People set up a vigil at the site to honour Good, lining the bank with candles and roses. Hundreds of demonstrators showed up throughout the day, shouting insults at ICE and offering their neighbours coffee on the cold winter day.

The protests remained largely peaceful there, as residents expressed their anger over the killing of Good. \"They cannot get away with killing someone. There has to be consequences for actions,\" said Gavin, one of dozens of people outside the federal building. Those who knew Good said she was a poet and guitarist who had just moved to the city of Minneapolis.

The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York. The release of political prisoners in Venezuela has been a long-held US demand, especially during moments of heightened repression around elections or protests.\n\nJorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that \"a significant number\" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.

Petro said the United States is treating other nations as part of a US \"empire\". It comes after Trump threatened Colombia with military action. He said that the US risks transforming from \"dominating the world\" to becoming \"isolated from the world.\" He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like \"Nazi brigades\". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US. The BBC has approached the White House for comment.\n\nFollowing US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to \"watch his ass\", remarks Petro strongly condemned. Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the \"near future. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honour\". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric \"from both sides.\" But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved. He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, \"most of it occupied by me,\" and covered \"drug trafficking Colombia\" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and \"what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States.\" Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like \"Nazi brigades\". President Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations, and has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking. Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US. The administration says it deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had \"voluntarily self-deported\", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention. About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University. This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight. Federal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city. Petro said ICE had \"reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens.\" He added that if this continued, \"instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world.\" Petro said the US has for \"decades\" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an \"empire\" regardless of the law.\n\nThe two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over \"oil and coal,\" adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, \"there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America.\" \"The Venezuelan issue is about this,\" he said. After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy. Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a \"real threat\", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said \"the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations.\" Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would \"prefer it to be about dialogue.\" He said that \"work is being done\" on this. But he added: \"Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies.\" \"It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have.\" Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia. He said Venezuela had \"long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies,\" adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other \"covert operations\" in Colombia. He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants.

Almameh Gibba, an MP and one of the plaintiffs, tabled a bill to decriminalise FGM that was rejected by the country’s parliament in 2024.\n\nActivists and lawyers see this as the latest move in a backlash against women’s rights that is eroding gender protections across the world.\n\nFatou Baldeh, founder of the Gambian rights organisation Women in Liberation & Leadership, said: “FGM is a strong manifestation of violence against women that harms their physical and psychological health.\n\n“If this issue is still being [debated at a national level], it shows us that women’s rights are really regressing. This is not an isolated issue – it’s part of a global regression on women’s rights.”\n\nThe Gambia has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world. Almost three-quarters of women between 15 and 49 have undergone the practice and nearly two-thirds of them were cut before the age of five.\n\nView image in fullscreen Members of the Gambian parliament debating whether to reverse the ban on FGM at the parliament in the capital, Banjul, in 2024. Photograph: Malick Njie/Reuters\n\nFGM involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, which can have serious long-term health consequences, including infertility. It is generally carried out without anaesthesia by untrained “cutters” using non-sterile instruments such as knives, razor blades or pieces of glass, and girls are usually forcibly restrained.\n\nThe practice is considered to be a grave violation of human rights and in 2012 the UN passed a resolution to ban it. Although is still practised in about 30 countries in Africa and Asia, FGM has no medical basis and is performed solely for cultural or religious reasons.\n\nView image in fullscreen Abdoulie Fatty, a leading imam who supports FGM. Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters\n\nUnder the current law in the Gambia, a cutter faces up to three years in prison, a fine of 50,000 dalasi (£500), or both. Where FGM leads to death, the perpetrator could face life imprisonment.\n\nAlthough criminalised in 2015, the law went unenforced until the first convictions took place in 2023. Three women were ordered to pay a fine or spend a year in prison for carrying out FGM on eight children. The convictions sparked a backlash against the ban, which led the country to the brink of repealing it.\n\nAfter the bill to overturn the law criminalising FGM was rejected, a coalition led by Gibba launched a case with the supreme court claiming that the law violated Gambians’ constitutional rights to cultural and religious freedoms.\n\nThe court has heard from two witnesses so far, Abdoulie Fatty, a prominent Muslim leader, claimed in December that female circumcision, though not mutilation, was part of Islam and was not harmful.\n\nWhen asked what he said to the families of two people who died from the practice, he replied: “We are Muslims and if someone dies, it’s God’s will.”\n\nHe said that the benefit of the practice was to reduce women’s sexual desire, which could be a problem for men.\n\nAlso due to give evidence is Fuambai Sia Nyoko Ahmadu, a dual US-Sierra Leonean citizen and founder of a pro-FGM organisation, Gambian Women are Free to Choose.\n\nIn December, she co-wrote an article, Harms of the current global anti-FGM campaign, for the BMJ Journal of Medical Ethics. The piece argued that “a ubiquitous ‘standard tale’ obscures the diversity of practices, meanings and experiences among those affected” by cutting.\n\nRepresenting the plaintiffs is Lamin J Darboe, a UK-trained lawyer with dual British-Gambian citizenship; he has announced a bid to run for the presidency in the country’s elections in December.\n\nView image in fullscreen People drive past a poster in Banjul calling for an end to female genital mutilation. The Gambia has one of the world’s highest rates of FGM. Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters\n\nIt comes after a ruling against Sierra Leone in July by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) court of justice, which described FGM as “one of the worst forms of violence against women” which “meets the threshold for torture”.\n\nThe president of Sierra Leone, Julius Maada Bio, is the current chair of Ecowas. Weeks after the ruling, he signed into law the Child Rights Act 2025, which did not ban FGM.\n\n“It speaks volumes that he refused to act on the ruling,” said Baldeh. “Within the region we have all these beautiful protocols and treaties protecting women and girls, which are all against FGM, yet nothing is being done.”\n\nAlso in Sierra Leone, there has been significant opposition to a bill on safe motherhood, which led to proposed amendments that restrict access to safe abortion.\n\nIt is widely seen as part of a new wave of attacks on women’s rights worldwide. In Afghanistan, the Taliban is eroding any rights women had before the militant Islamists seized power; in the US, restrictions on access to abortion and contraception services are increasing, and in Iran, women are key targets of the regime.\n\nAccording to a report by Equality Now, new legislative proposals in Bolivia and Uruguay threaten to weaken protections against sexual violence.\n\n“Civil society organisations face increasing pressure under repressive laws, such as in India and Kyrgyzstan, while government bodies responsible for advancing women’s rights are being dismantled in South Korea and Argentina,” said the report.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:00:29 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T06:49:46.508959"}

Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions. It only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024. Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack on Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.\n\nWhile the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv. Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border. The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart. \"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's home in December.

There has been a significant backlash after the chatbot honoured requests from users to digitally alter images of other people by undressing them without their consent. But Grok is now telling people asking it to make such material that only paid subscribers would be able to do so - meaning their name and payment information must be on file. The BBC has approached X for comment.\n\nThose who do not subscribe can still use Grok to edit images on its separate app and website. \"Musk has thrown his toys out of the pram in protest at being held to account for the tsunami of abuse,\" said Professor Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse. \"Instead of taking the responsible steps to ensure Grok could not be used for abusive purposes, it has withdrawn access for the vast majority of users.\" And Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation, said it \"does not undo the harm which has been done\". \"We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery we have seen in recent days,\" she said., The charity previously said its analysts had discovered \"criminal imagery\" of girls aged between 11 and 13 which \"appeared to have been created\" using Grok. \"Sitting and waiting for unsafe products to be abused before taking action is unacceptable,\" Swirsky said. It comes after the government urged regulator Ofcom to use all its powers – up to and including an effective ban – against X over concerns about unlawful AI images created on the site. Addressing concerns that sexualised images of adults and children had been generated by Grok, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\". He said Ofcom had the government's \"full support\" to act on the content. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table,\" he said in an interview with Greatest Hits Radio. Government sources told BBC News: \"We would expect Ofcom to use all powers at its disposal in regard to Grok and X.\" Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping the Elon Musk-owned platform raise money or be accessed in the UK.

In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting \"death to the dictator\", referencing Khamenei. In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard. Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured. Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.

Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough. \"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\" \"And by the way Nato's got to understand that,\" the US president added. Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\". Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\". They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".\n\nConcerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week. In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change.

He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.\n\nMany of the victims' families had demanded action like this from the start: more than a week after the fire, the anger in this community has been increasing.\n\nAt the main ceremony in Martigny, down in the valley, relatives of the dead were joined by survivors. Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support.\n\n\"The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic,\" a young woman called Marie told the audience.\n\nShe had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames.\n\nShe said she would never forget what she'd seen.\n\nListening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations.\n\nBack in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified.\n\n\"This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs,\" Giorgia Meloni said.\n\nShe wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started.\n\n\"Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys.\"\n\nIn Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more.\n\nFor now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors. They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged.\n\nNow Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody. In a statement, the public ministry said the move followed a \"new assessment of the flight risk.\"\n\n\"I constantly think of the victims and of the people who are struggling,\" his wife told a crush of TV cameras after several hours of questioning at the ministry.\n\nIt was her first public comment since the fire.\n\n\"It is an unimaginable tragedy. It happened in our establishment, and I would like to apologise.\"\n\nNine days on, Le Constellation is still obscured from view behind white plastic sheets. A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow.\n\nWhat unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened.\n\nMobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly.\n\nWhen the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked.\n\nBut another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable.\n\n\"Be careful with the foam,\" the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers.\n\nBut the questions here are not just for the owners.\n\nThis week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years.\n\nThey offered no explanation.\n\n\"It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape,\" Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations.\n\nSix Italians were killed as a result.\n\n\"Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice,\" the ambassador stressed.\n\nThat includes for those with life-changing injuries.\n\nThe regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year.\n\n\"They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child,\" hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers.\n\nBut he's proud of how his team coped.\n\nSome casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them.\n\nThe most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition.\n\nAll face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a \"rebirth\" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face.\n\n\"First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity,\" Professor Bonvin says.\n\n\"It will take a lot of work and resilience.\"\n\nAdd to that the anguish of surviving.\n\n\"They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother,\" Bonvin explains.\n\n\"It is a delicate moment.\"\n\nIn central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas.\n\nAfter leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment.

The vast island finds itself in the eye of a geopolitical storm with Trump's name on it and people here are clearly unnerved. Yet when you fly in, it looks so peaceful. Ice and snow-capped mountains stretch as far as the eye can see, interrupted here and there by glittering fjords - all between the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. It is said to sit on top of the world; much of it above the Arctic Circle. Greenland is nine times the size of the UK but it only has 57,000 inhabitants, most of them indigenous Inuit.\n\nThe scene on a snowy street in Nuuk, Greenland's capital city\n\nYou find the biggest cluster of Greenlanders on the south-western coast in the capital, Nuuk. We arrived there as a frozen twilight was creeping across snow-covered pedestrian streets. Parents dragged their children home from school on sledges, and students mooched their way in and out of brightly-lit malls. Few wanted to talk to us about the Trump-related angst here. Those who did sounded very gloomy. One pensioner banged his walking stick on the ground in emphasis as he told me the US must never plant its flag in Greenland's capital. A lady who said she was mistrustful of everyone these days, and didn't give her name, admitted she was \"scared to death\" about the prospect of Trump taking the island by force after she watched his military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nPilu Chemnitz (left) says Greenlanders \"just want to be left alone\"\n\nMeanwhile, 20-something pottery-maker Pilu Chemnitz said: \"I think we are all very tired of the US president. We have always lived a quiet and peaceful life here. \"Of course, the colonisation by Denmark caused a lot of trauma for many people but we just want to be left alone.\" Never mind opposing a takeover by the US, which 85% of Greenlanders say they do, most also say they favour independence from Denmark - although many tell me they also appreciate the subsidies coming from there that help prop up their welfare state. While rich in untapped natural resources, poverty is a real issue here in Inuit communities. Overall, Greenlanders want a bigger, louder say, not only in their domestic policies, but in foreign affairs too. I went to the island's modest-looking parliament, the body of it built in a Scandinavian style with wooden slats and painted the same burnished red as the Greenlandic flags fluttering by the entrance. No security checks. All pretty relaxed. Except for the roaring polar bear emblem - a symbol of Greenland, etched onto every sliding glass doors we pass.\n\nPipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen hopes Marco Rubio's talks next week with Danish officials \"will end with understanding and compromise\"\n\nI was there to meet Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen, co-chair of the foreign affairs committee in parliament. She is an MP with the pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party that is part of the coalition government here. \"I think it's very important for us to speak out about what we want as a people,\" she told me. \"We have always worked towards independence when we got home rule in 1979 and more independence in 2009.\" I asked Lynge-Rasmussen if she felt that big global powers - the US, Denmark, Nato, and the EU - were talking a lot about Greenland right now, rather than to the islanders about their fate. She nodded vigorously. Surprisingly, perhaps, she blames Denmark more than she blames Trump for overlooking Greenlanders' wants and needs. Even though Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, she says, she feels they have always been treated like second-class citizens. But Lynge-Rasmussen insisted that Greenlanders should not see themselves as victims in the current situation. Instead, she suggests they use the international spotlight now on them to show off their importance and push for their priorities. What of the meeting next week with Rubio, I asked? \"I hope the meeting will end with understanding and compromise,\" she answered. \"Maybe doing business with [the US] from here… maybe co-operating on trade, or mining, having more American [military] bases on Greenland, perhaps?\" Under a bilateral agreement with Denmark dating back to 1951 the US may bring as many US troops as it wants to Greenland. This has left European allies wondering out loud why Trump feels the need to \"take\" the island unilaterally: whether buying it - seemingly Washington's preferred option, or encouraging Greenlanders to vote in a plebiscite to become part of the US, or taking Greenland by force, something the Trump administration has refused to rule out. It wouldn't take much flexing of military muscles. Greenland has few trained soldiers and no military bases of its own. Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance justify their need to \"take\" Greenland because they say Denmark doesn't do enough to secure the island. Copenhagen disputes this. It's also worth noting that the US already has a military base on Greenland - and it chose to radically reduce its presence there from about 10,000 personnel during peak Cold War times to some 200 now. The US has long taken its eye off Arctic security, until recently. Trump's keen interest in the island is likely a mix of: perceived national security concerns\n\na hunger for the rich natural resources Greenland boasts, including rare earths and minerals\n\nand his loudly-trumpeted desire to dominate the Americas.\n\nSnow-covered houses in Nuuk at nighttime", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:01:50 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-10T06:38:20.836106"}

Switzerland, often praised for its efficiency, has a very devolved system of government, in which villages and towns are run by local officials elected from and by the community. It is a system the Swiss cherish, because they believe it ensures accountability. But there are inherent weaknesses: hypothetically, the official approving a bar license or passing a fire-safety check is the friend, neighbour, or maybe even cousin of the bar owner.\n\nWatch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor says\n\nWhen the news of the fire emerged on New Year's Eve, first there was shock. Such devastating fires are not, people thought, supposed to happen in Switzerland. Then there was grief - 40 young people lost their lives, 116 were injured, many of them very seriously. Questions followed - what caused such a catastrophe? And finally, this week - fury when Crans-Montana's Mayor, Nicolas Feraud, revealed that Le Constellation bar had not been inspected since 2019. Crans-Montana is in the Swiss canton of Valais, where fire-safety inspections are the responsibility of Mayor Feraud and his colleagues, and they are supposed to happen every 12 months. Not only had the checks not taken place, the mayor said, he had only become aware of this after the fire. And, he revealed, of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected in 2025. Asked why, Feraud had no answer, though he did suggest Crans-Montana had too few inspectors for the number of properties that needed checking. This was echoed by Romy Biner, the mayor of neighbouring upmarket resort Zermatt, who told local media that many communities in the canton of Valais did not have the required resources to inspect so many premises. This is not a line that plays well with many Swiss, who know that Crans-Montana and Zermatt are two of the richest winter resorts in the country. So when Feraud faced the press, there were pointed questions from Swiss journalists: How well did the mayor know the bar's owners? Had he ever been to the bar? And, was there any possibility of corruption? \"Absolutely not,\" was his indignant answer to the last question. The mother of two brothers who survived the fire also had questions. \"We urgently need complete, transparent answers,\" she wrote on social media. When they escaped the burning bar, each of her sons had thought at first that the other was dead. \"They escaped, but they are deeply traumatised. They will carry the emotional scars forever.\" Those questions, from journalists and families, reveal the problems of Switzerland's devolved political system.\n\n'A failure right across the board'", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:19:34 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-10T06:38:20.980559"}

One doctor said an eye hospital in Tehran had gone into crisis mode, while the BBC also obtained a message from a medic in another hospital saying it did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx of patients. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said Iran was in \"big trouble\" and warned \"you better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too\". Iran, in a letter to the UN Security Council, blamed the US for turning the protests into what it called \"violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism\".\n\nMeanwhile, international leaders called for the right to peaceful protest to be protected. Anti-government protests have taken place in dozens of cities, with at least 50 protesters reported killed by two human rights groups. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran, and the country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. A doctor from Iran, who contacted the BBC via Starlink satellite internet on Friday night, said Farabi Hospital, Tehran's main eye specialist centre, had gone into crisis mode, with emergency services overwhelmed. Non-urgent admissions and surgeries were said to have been suspended, and staff called in to deal with emergency cases. The BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic in a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday. The medic said large numbers of injured people were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx. He claimed many of the wounded had gunshot injuries to the head and eyes.\n\nWatch: Protesters take to the streets of Tehran on Friday night\n\nSince protests began on 28 December, at least 50 protesters and 15 security personnel have been killed, according to the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). More than 2,311 individuals have also been arrested, the group reported. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed. BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. United Nations Secretary General spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the UN was very disturbed by the loss of life. \"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said. French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement that said: \"The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal.\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday, saying: \"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this.\" Later, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated the message, saying Iran \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\".

The search for answers set off a battle for the truth.", "content": "'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Joel Gunter , senior international reporter, New Brunswick and Nadine Yousif , senior Canada reporter, New Brunswick Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nFive hundred people in a small Canadian province were diagnosed with a mystery brain disease. What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?\n\nIn early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD. CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning. Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died. Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped. More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q. Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"\n\nMany of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nOver the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease. Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\". To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests. We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying. The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real. Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up. \"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"\n\nLucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\". Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself. \"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\" Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.\n\nJillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nMarrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle. It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients. \"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease. \"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\" In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers. Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists. \"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star. \"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.\n\nDr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nAt the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate. And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\". \"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote. But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\". Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email. \"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote. \"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"\n\nThe early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit. Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.) According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"\n\nBy April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery. But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said. None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province. But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up. \"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"\n\nTaking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists. Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists. Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.\n\nA protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nBut the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying. At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\" Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone. \"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\" Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\" In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero. Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"\n\nJillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nShe wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion. Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\" Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant. \"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"\n\nAs the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told. Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness. \"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.\n\nKevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nThe couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\" Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said. Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion. Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\" But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.\n\nSandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nOne thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment. Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\" Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"\n\nGabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path. Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school. Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.\n\nGabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nMarrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them. \"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\" There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang. After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology. The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition. A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it. The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers. \"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.\n\nGlobal News Gabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)\n\nThe call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\" \"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\" Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition. Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life. \"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. \"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"\n\nLang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her. Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade. Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".\n\nDr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)\n\nThe cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met. The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.\n\nOn a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said. Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care. Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated. \"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\" Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"\n\nDr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nAn upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\" The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists. Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said. Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground. \"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said. \"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\" Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint. And that was the issue, one former senior health official said. \"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"\n\nThe last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\" Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse. In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.\n\nJillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said.

Verified videos and eyewitness accounts seen by the BBC appeared to show the government was ramping up its response, as it continues an overarching internet blackout. The country's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, said on Saturday that anyone protesting would be considered an \"enemy of God\" - an offence that carries the death penalty. Hundreds of protesters are believed to have been killed or injured since protests began more than two weeks ago, and many more detained.\n\nThe protests were sparked by soaring inflation, and have spread to more than 100 cities and towns across every province in Iran. Now protesters are calling for an end to the clerical rulership of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Iranian government has imposed the internet shutdown in an effort to stop the protests. Iran's data infrastructure is tightly controlled by the state and security authorities. Internet access is largely limited to a domestic intranet, with restricted links to the outside world. Over the past few years, the government has progressively curtailed access to the global internet. However, during the current round of protests, authorities have, for the first time, not only shut down access to the worldwide internet but also severely restricted the domestic intranet. An expert told BBC Persian that the current shutdown is more severe than that imposed during the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" uprising three years ago. Alireza Manafi, an internet researcher, said internet access in Iran, in any form, was now \"almost completely down\". He added the only likely way to connect to the outside world was via Starlink, but warned users to exercise caution, as such connections could potentially be traced by the government. The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Nonetheless, some video footage has emerged, and the BBC has spoken to people on the ground. Verified video from Saturday night showed protesters taking over the streets in Tehran's Gisha district. Several videos, verified and confirmed as recent by BBC Verify, show clashes between protesters and security forces on Vakil Abad Boulevard in Mashhad, Iran's second largest city. Masked protesters are seen taking cover behind wheelie bins and bonfires, while a row of security forces is seen in the distance. A vehicle that appears to be a bus is engulfed in flames. Multiple gunshots and what sounds like banging on pots and pans can be heard as a green laser beam lights up the scene. A figure standing on a nearby footbridge is visible in the footage and appears to fire multiple gunshots in several directions as a couple of people take cover behind a fence on the side of the boulevard. A few videos have also emerged from the capital Tehran. One video, authenticated by BBC Verify, shows a large group of protesters and the sound of banging on pots in Punak Square in west Tehran, which has been one of the hotspots of protests this week. Another clip, filmed in the Heravi district in north-east Tehran and confirmed by BBC Persian and BBC Verify, shows a crowd of protesters marching on a road and calling for the end of the clerical establishment.\n\n'US ready to help'\n\nOn Saturday, US President Donald Trump wrote on social media: \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" He did not elaborate, but US media reported that Trump had been briefed on options for military strikes in the country. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that the briefings had taken place, with the Journal describing them as \"preliminary discussions\". An unnamed official told the WSJ there was no \"imminent threat\" to Iran, the paper wrote. Last year, the US conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. US Senator Lindsey Graham posted several times in support of the protests on social media, writing: \"To the Iranian people: your long nightmare is soon coming to a close.\" Their \"bravery and determination to end your oppression\" had been \"noticed\" by the US president, he said. \"Help is on the way,\" he added in the same post. Earlier, he said: \"To the regime leadership: your brutality against the great people of Iran will not go unchallenged.\" As dawn broke on Sunday in Iran, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah (king), whose return protesters have been calling for, posted a video to X. Its caption said: \"Know that you are not alone. Your compatriots around the world are proudly shouting your voice... In particular, President Trump, as the leader of the free world, has carefully observed your indescribable bravery and has announced that he is ready to help you.\" He added: \"I know that I will soon be by your side.\" US-based Pahlavi has been calling for people to take to the streets, and has said he is preparing to return to the country. He claimed the Islamic republic was facing a \"severe shortage of mercenaries\" and that \"many armed and security forces have left their workplaces or disobeyed orders to suppress the people\". The BBC could not verify these claims. Pahlavi encouraged people to continue protesting on Sunday evening, but to stay in groups or with crowds and not \"endanger your lives\".\n\nWatch: Protesters take to the streets of Tehran on Friday night", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:44:56 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-11T05:56:36.191265"}

The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel in Iran, while sources tell the BBC the death toll could be much higher. Trump has threatened to intervene, and said on Sunday that Iranian officials had called him \"to negotiate\" - but added \"we may have to act before a meeting\".

In a video announcing the probe, Powell said the US justice department served the agency with subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. He called the probe \"unprecedented\" and said he believed it was opened due to him drawing Donald Trump's ire over refusing to lower interest rates despite repeated public pressure from the president. The Fed chair is the latest to come at odds with Trump and then face criminal investigation by the US justice department.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the justice department and the White House for comment. \"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said. \"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" he went on to say. Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Sunday that he did not have any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the Fed. \"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he said of Powell. The probe, which prosecutors have not confirmed, would signal a fresh escalation in Trump's ongoing dispute with Powell, who the president nominated for the role as Fed chair in 2017.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to remove Powell, who he has criticised for not cutting interest rates as quickly as the president would have liked. In the second half of 2025, the Fed cut interest rates three times. The president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, and interest rates for inflation and costs in the US. Critics have raised concerns that Trump's pressure to oust the Fed chair would muddy the institution's authority to set interest rates independently from presidents. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, \"until this legal matter is fully resolved\". \"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement. \"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" the senator said. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said she believed Trump's plan was to push Powell off the Fed board for good and \"install another sock puppet to complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank\". \"This committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair,\" she said. Powell's investigation will be overseen by the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, according to the New York Times, which first reported the probe. April Larusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment, told the BBC's Today programme that \"it really isn't the case that the Federal Reserve has been doing nothing on interest rates so this does feel like perhaps it is pressure that isn't really justified\". She added that Trump wants lower rates as \"he is definitely trying to make sure that all parts of the economy benefit\". \"For people at the lower end of the income spectrum things have been difficult – inflation was very high, wages were not keeping up with inflation - and so there is a big part of the US population that frankly is still suffering with a cost of living crisis.\" The criminal probe into Powell, together with news of continued unrest in Iran, sparked a jump in the price of precious metals. The price of gold - which is often seen a safer asset in times of uncertainty - was up 1.4% at $4,572.36 per ounce on Monday, having hit a record high of $4,600.33 earlier. Silver also hit a record high - of $84.58 an ounce - before slipping back to $83.26 per ounce, a rise of 5.4% for the day.\n\nTrump previously took aim at Lisa Cook, a governor at the US central bank, whom he tried to fire over alleged mortgage fraud. The case was blocked by a US federal court and will be heard by the Supreme Court later this month. Criminal charges brought by Trump's justice department against political adversaries like New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against Trump in 2024, and ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation boss James Comey were also dismissed by a court. Comey was accused of making false statements and obstructing justice. He was fired by Trump during his first term after leading a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, which Trump won over Hillary Clinton. Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and said the prosecutions were politically charged.\n\nWatch: Trump jokes he wants Powell to lower interest rates in awkward exchange", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 03:26:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-12T09:17:53.855372"}

Chalamet, 30, continued his pursuit of greatness, and an Oscar, by beating stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to the award for best actor in a musical or comedy for table tennis caper Marty Supreme. Despite DiCaprio missing out, his film One Battle After Another won the most awards overall, with four prizes including best musical or comedy film and best director. Irish actress Jessie Buckley was named best drama actress for Hamnet, which also scored a surprise win in the best drama film category.\n\nVampire thriller Sinners had been considered the frontrunner, but it instead went home with the box office achievement prize as well as best score. The Golden Globes are a key stop on the road to the Academy Awards, and other acting winners on Sunday included Teyana Taylor, Rose Byrne, Wagner Moura and Stellan Skarsgård. Unlike the Oscars, the Globes also reward TV shows, and the night saw British actors Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty pick up more honours for their performances in Netflix drama Adolescence.\n\nWatch: Stars light up the red carpet at the 83rd Annual Golden Globes\n\nChalamet's 'sweet' win\n\nGetty Images Kylie Jenner didn't walk the red carpet with Chalamet, but met him inside the ceremony\n\nWith all eyes on the Oscars race, Timothée Chalamet's victory has given him a boost over his rivals. \"I'm in a category with many greats,\" he said when accepting his trophy. It was Chalamet's fifth Globes nomination, but his first win. \"My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up, always be grateful for what you have,\" he said. \"It's allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments make this moment that much sweeter. \"For my parents, for my partner, I love you so much,\" he added, looking at girlfriend Kylie Jenner.\n\nJessie Buckley says win is 'real honour'\n\nGetty Images Hamnet's Jessie Buckley won best actress, a category she is expected to sweep throughout awards season\n\nJessie Buckley was named best actress for her role in the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's best-selling novel Hamnet, about the death of William Shakespeare's son. \"This is not a normal feeling or situation to be in,\" she said in her acceptance speech. \"It was such an extraordinary set to be part of, because we were telling the story of probably the most famous Brit that ever lived, and we had a Chinese director, a lot of Irish, a mostly Polish crew, beside our British family.\" She concluded: \"This is a real honour, I love being part of this industry.\" Shortly afterwards, Hamnet director Chloe Zhao looked visibly shocked when the movie was announced as the winner of best drama film. Accepting the prize, producer Steven Spielberg said he had \"loved the book\" by O'Farrell, but felt Zhao was \"the only film-maker on the face of the planet who could tell the story\". Zhao said: \"The village of Hamnet that made this film together. Some of them lost their loved ones while we were making this film, and some of them are still struggling, and I just wanted to say we're thinking of you, we're here because of you, we love you.\"\n\nTeyana Taylor's tearful message\n\nGetty Images Teyana Taylor was named best supporting actress for One Battle After Another\n\nElsewhere, singer and actress Teyana Taylor, whose career started when she choreographed a Beyonce music video at the age of 15, cemented her Hollywood breakthrough by winning best supporting film actress for One Battle After Another. After tearfully thanking a list of people, she used her acceptance speech to send a message to \"my brown sisters and little brown girls watching tonight\". \"Our light does not need permission to shine,\" she told them. \"We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nSwedish actor Stellan Skarsgård, 74, won best supporting actor for Sentimental Value, and joked that he hadn't prepared a speech \"because I thought that I was too old\". He then made an impassioned plea for people to see films like his on the big screen. \"Cinema should be seen in cinemas,\" he said to cheers from the crowd.\n\nAustralia's Rose Byrne was named best actress in a film musical or comedy for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, and paid tribute to members of her family. \"My brother's my date. Thanks, George,\" she laughed. \"Thanks to my mum and dad, who bought Paramount+ so they could watch the Golden Globes from Sydney. \"And I want to thank my husband, Bobby Cannavale. He couldn't be here because, um, we're getting a bearded dragon, and he went to a reptile expo in New Jersey. So thank you, baby.\"\n\nGetty Images Rose Byrne was named best musical or comedy actress for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You\n\nMeanwhile, KPop Demon Hunters won best animated film and best song for Golden. Brazilian political thriller The Secret Agent was named best international film, while its star Wagner Moura won best drama actor. \"This is a film about generational trauma,\" Moura said, \"and I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too. So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments.\" Paul Thomas Anderson won best film director and screenplay for One Battle After Another. \"You guys are being so generous with this affection for me and this film,\" Anderson said, adding: \"I love doing what I do.\"\n\nAdolescence star 'still learning'\n\nGetty Images Owen Cooper repeated his recent Emmy and Critics Choice wins for his role in Adolescence\n\nBritish teenager Owen Cooper continued a year of adulation and awards acclaim for his performance in Adolescence, winning best TV supporting actor. The 16-year-old from Warrington appears to be keeping his feet on the ground, telling the assembled A-listers: \"I'm still very much an apprentice. I'm still learning every day. I'm still learning from the people that are sitting in front of you and sitting in front of me.\" And he still seems in disbelief at his meteoric rise, remarking: \"It's mad, what is going on?\" before signing off with the motto of his beloved Liverpool FC: \"You'll never walk alone.\"\n\nGetty Images Seth Rogen won best comedy TV actor for his leading role in Hollywood satire The Studio", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:13:40 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-12T09:17:54.166701"}

However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns.\n\nThe ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.\n\nIn December, a new law began requiring that the world's most popular social media sites - including Instagram and Facebook - stop Australians aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms.\n\nAbout 550,000 accounts were blocked by Meta during the first days of Australia's landmark social media ban for kids.\n\n\"We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans,\" Meta said in a blog update.\n\nThe company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during it's first week of compliance with the new law.\n\nThey again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.\n\n\"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law.\"\n\nVarious governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.\n\nThe policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029.\n\nHowever some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.\n\nAnd backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:45:34 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-12T09:17:54.321719"}

Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian. \"Everyone knew him for his kindness\", they said, adding his family is grieving and \"angry because he was killed by the regime\". Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. \"She fought for things she knew were right\", her uncle told CNN. Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says.\n\nSources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported. Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA. Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene. \"It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young,\" the friend said. The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: \"From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother.\" They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as \"someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery\". \"Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him,\" his friend said. \"The family are both grieving and angry.

Swiss prosecutors have argued that Jacques Moretti, a French national, is a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence. The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana also left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20. The fire is believed to have been started by sparklers in champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations.\n\nAuthorities acknowledged last week that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.\n\nWatch: Co-owner of Swiss ski bar apologises to victims\n\nJacques Moretti was first detained on Friday for an initial period of 48 hours. On Monday, a judge at what is known as a court of coercive measures ruled that he should be kept in custody for three months - a period that can be renewed under Swiss law. It is known as provisional - or preventive - detention and is meant to last until a case goes to court. In this instance, the court said the measure may be lifted upon payment of bail, whose sum would be set later. The couple were placed under criminal investigation days after the devastating fire. Moretti's wife, Jessica, who is under house arrest, told reporters on Friday that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".
