At least three people were killed, according to Ukrainian officials, including a four-year-old child, while energy infrastructure was also targeted, leaving several regions without power. Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed. Zelensky said \"people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe\" in the run-up to Christmas, and said the strikes sent \"an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities\" despite ongoing peace talks.\n\nHe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia\". Zelensky had previously warned it was in the Kremlin's \"nature\" to \"carry out massive attacks\" during the festive period. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nLocal authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death. Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added. Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service. An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said. Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit. Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia. Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant. The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.\n\nReuters Emergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capital\n\nWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\". The main focus of Russian attacks in recent days has been the southern port city of Odesa, which comes after Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. The Russian president made the threat in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on tankers belonging to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", vessels used to move goods including oil which are under Western sanctions.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:11:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:57.119660"}

Germany’s humanitarian budget of €1.05bn (£920m) for 2026 will be less than half of last year’s, with spending refocused on areas deemed a priority to Europe.\n\n“I think we are losing a consensus of solidarity and responsibility which has been established for a while now,” said Ralf Südhoff, director of the Berlin-based Centre for Humanitarian Action.\n\n“Germany this year has started to phase out Latin America, decreased engagement in Asia and say they want to focus now on crises which have an impact on Europe,” he said, noting that while Ukraine was in need of funding because of Russia’s invasion, its location in Europe meant it was saved from the cuts developing countries have experienced.\n\nThe UK also announced earlier this year that it would be cutting aid to fund defence spending. Norway has increased its civilian support to Ukraine by 2.5bn kroner (£185m), to a quarter of its aid budget, but has been accused of making Africa pay for that rise with a 355m kroner cut (£26m).\n\nFrance’s budget for 2026 will also see a €700m cut to aid spending, with a 60% reduction in food aid, while increasing defence spending by €6.7bn.\n\n“It’s a broader geopolitical trend and there’s a misleading belief by European actors that they have to play this game now in the same way as Moscow, Beijing, Washington,” said Südhoff, suggesting aid will be more “transactional” and directed to where donors see direct benefits for themselves. “The reaction now is not to fill the gap or attempt to do so but to follow the [American] cuts.”\n\nAnalysis of Germany’s 2026 aid budget by Venro, a coalition of German NGOs, shows that the country is slashing funding to traditional development and poverty-reduction programmes, with a 20% cut for the World Food Programme and 33% for the Gavi vaccine alliance.\n\nOne of the few elements of the budget not cut is Germany’s partnerships with the private sector in developing countries.\n\nAnita Kattakuzhy, director of policy at Near, a coalition of civil society groups in the global south, said a wider pattern is emerging among donors.\n\n“Budgets are being reshaped under political pressure, and the communities who bear the consequences have no way to shape those decisions,” said Kattakuzhy.\n\n“Cutting funding in this way may meet short-term priorities in donor capitals, but it destabilises the local systems that are keeping crises from getting worse.”\n\nAmong the countries most affected by aid cuts is Mozambique, which has suffered from cyclones and droughts as well as a resurgent conflict in the country’s Cabo Delgado province that has displaced more than 300,000 people since July.\n\nThe country has received only $31m of $222m funding required this year, leading to food distribution happening only every two months and covering 39% of caloric needs, according to the UN.\n\nThe cutting of development funding by Sweden will directly hit programmes used to rehabilitate and provide healthcare and education to people displaced by the insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, which began in 2017.\n\nAll four of the African countries removed from Sweden’s development funding have seen cuts for HIV/Aids services, as experts warn there will be a reversal of years of progress in fighting the disease.\n\nMozambique, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are among six countries, along with Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia – that could bear the brunt of cuts to health programmes tackling HIV/Aids, according to analysis by the Boston Consultant Group.\n\nIlaria Manunza, country director for Save the Children Mozambique, said aid cuts have already made 2025 very difficult: “Every cut compounds the risk of long-term developmental setbacks, particularly in education and child protection,” said Manunza. “If current trends continue, 2026 will be extremely challenging … there is a real risk that progress made over the past decade could be reversed.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:00:05 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:58.250661"}

The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending. But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\n\n\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\". \"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added. The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%. It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply, bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:56:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:32:09.831119"}

On the Epstein investigation, the DOJ's note reads \"the investigation to date has revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation\". The document also underlined that Andrew was not a \"target\" of the investigation and no evidence had been gathered that he had committed any crime under US law.

The 11,000-plus documents continue a stream of released information that began on Friday, the deadline mandated in a new law that required the department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the deceased paedophile and financier. Many of the documents released on Tuesday are redacted with names and information blacked out, including names of people who the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case. The justice department is facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law specifically states can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations. President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated Trump flew on Epstein's jet. The justice department said some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump. Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.\n\nEmail exchange between 'A' and Ghislaine Maxwell about 'girls'\n\nOf the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" stands out. The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\". \"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\" The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\". An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\". Email by 'A' from 'Balmoral' asked Ghislaine Maxwell for 'inappropriate friends', Epstein files show\n\nWho and what are in the Epstein files?\n\nWhat the underwhelming Epstein files release means for Trump and Maga Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru. In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\". The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response.\n\nFBI email lists out 10 alleged co-conspirators to Epstein\n\nUS Department of Justice\n\nAmong the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein. The emails said six of the 10 co-conspirators had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut. Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\". Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file. Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner. An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\". The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier. Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\". \"Mr. Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said. Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DOJ. \"There's 10 co-conspirators potentially that we knew nothing about that the DOJ had been investigating,\" Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency. The law passed by Congress and signed by President Trump states names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted and specifically asks the justice department for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions concerning \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".\n\nJustice Department says Epstein letter to Larry Nassar is a fake\n\nGetty Images Larry Nassar\n\nA letter included in the released batch of documents got a lot of attention online. But, according to the justice department, it is fake. The handwritten letter and envelope at first appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes. \"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the faux letter states. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\" The writer signs it, \"Life is unfair, Yours, J. Epstein.\" The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent back to a Manhattan jail where Epstein was detained before his death. The FBI was alerted to the returned letter and requested an analysis of it. That request was also included in the releases batch of documents. The justice department on Tuesday called the letter a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it. \"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X. \"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" they added. Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died. Even before the justice department's announcement of it being fake, the documents raised immediate questions. The return sender was listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was \"Metropolitan Correctional Center\". The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI. A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison. Nassar is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nTrump's travels aboard Epstein's private jet\n\nGetty Images\n\nTrump's name appears more in these files than in other batches of documents released by the justice department. Notably, in a January 2020 email, a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\". The recipient of the email was redacted. Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\". Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999. The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted. Trump travelled on Epstein's plane more than previously thought, prosecutor says\n\nImage in Epstein files that features Trump reinstated after backlash\n\nClinton and Trump - Two US presidents and their long associations with Jeffrey Epstein \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\" The timing of the trips coincide with years in which federal prosecutors were examining Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. She was ultimately found guilty of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse minors. But throughout the files released on Tuesday, many of the other mentions of Trump's name are simply in press clippings mentioning him, his campaigns, and other news moments. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in regards to Epstein. In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the Department of Justice said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\". \"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,\" the justice department said.\n\nFake video of Epstein included", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:08:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T02:10:57.679496"}

The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community. The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.\"\n\n\"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,\" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday. Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament. Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country. It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month. Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute. Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition.\n\nBeatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states. In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\". The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:11:10 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T22:26:08.958858"}

She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety.\n\nIn a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes.\n\nThe Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCombs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters.\n\nDuring a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.\n\nThe jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. That bid was not successful.\n\nAhead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years.\n\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\".\n\nCombs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison.\n\nIt argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\".\n\nBefore Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\"\n\n\"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\"\n\nCombs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation.

More than 1 million people have been displaced, many of them two, three or even four times.\n\nNeither the Mozambican army nor a Rwandan intervention have managed to quell the insurgency, which has ravaged northern Mozambique since October 2017, when militants from Islamic State-Mozambique, an affiliate of the main IS group in the Middle East, carried out their first attacks, in Mocímboa da Praia in Cabo Delgado province in the north-east.\n\nThe group drew global attention in March 2021 with an attack on the town of Palma. More than 600 people were killed in the assault and the military’s subsequent recapturing of the town, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a non-profit conflict monitor, including foreign workers on a multibillion-dollar Total liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.\n\nRwanda, whose military is better equipped and trained than Mozambique’s, deployed 1,000 troops to Cabo Delgado in July 2021, initially pushing back the militants.

After eight years … there are no effective initiatives of dialogue.”\n\nHe said much of the military effort was focused on securing the estimated $20bn LNG project, which Total said in October it would resume once it received government approval.\n\nNhamirre said: “First you need to ask what [objective] the Rwandan and Mozambican forces had. If it is to guarantee human security, then we can say that they have failed … But if the objective is to secure the LNG project, then they have achieved some success … The LNG project is definitely more secure than in 2021.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Displaced survivors of an attack by IS-linked militants arriving at Pemba port, Mozambique, in April 2021.

In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that there had been sharp increase in such kidnappings.\n\nSheila Nhancale, a researcher for HRW, said: “The displacement that is happening now is also increasing the risk of sexual violence, exploitation and abuse, particularly for women and children. Of the 100,000 displaced [in November], 70,000 are children.”\n\nPeople forced to flee are also facing shrinking support. Donors have given $195m to the humanitarian response this year – only 55% of the estimated need – compared with $246m last year, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nSebastián Traficante, the head of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières in Mozambique, said displaced people “have to stay in places with very poor conditions, with very poor access to basic services … that are already affected by eight years of conflict.\n\n“They just want this to end.

Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, especially among the religious right in America, and it has often been framed as religious persecution.\n\nHowever, Nigeria’s government rejects framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution, saying in the past that armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and US claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But the government has previously agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups.\n\nMany analysts say the situation is complex and has long roots in the region’s history. In some parts of the country, clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water.\n\nPriests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom, but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.\n\nTrump, who positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in 2024, campaigned on the promise of extraditing the US from decades of “endless wars”.

Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also so far ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, tells the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods – but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:09:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T05:01:10.478342"}

Zelensky said he expected the meeting to take place on Sunday and to focus on a US-brokered 20-point peace plan, as well as separate proposals for US security guarantees. Meanwhile, the Kremlin says President Vladimir Putin's senior aide has held further talks with US officials over the phone, and that Russia has committed to continuing with the negotiations. Russia has spoken of \"slow but steady progress\" in talks but has not commented on Zelensky's offer to withdraw troops from the eastern Donbas, if Russia pulls back too.\n\nUkraine has sought to secure guarantees from the US as part of a deal, and Zelensky has suggested that a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" is a potential option for areas of Donbas that Russia has failed to take by force. On Friday, Zelensky said he had received an update on the latest technical talks from his most senior negotiator, Rustem Umerov. He wrote on social media: \"We are not losing a single day. We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year.\" A White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump in February, the first after the US president returned to office, descended into a hostile shouting match, though their most recent meeting at the White House in October was far more amicable.\n\nReuters Ukrainian soldiers were pictured eating a Christmas meal together as fighting continued along the front line\n\nConfirmation of planned top-level talks came after the Ukrainian leader said he had spoken to Trump's chief negotiators, special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, for an hour over the phone on Christmas Day. He said the latest round of negotiations had generated \"new ideas\" on how to end the war, and described it as a \"really good conversation\". The White House has proposed establishing what would in effect be a demilitarised zone in eastern Ukraine where both sides agree not to deploy troops - a compromise that would avoid settling the intractable question of legal ownership over the contested territory. Zelensky signalled on Wednesday that if Ukraine were to pull back by up to 40km (25 miles) from the front line in the east to create an economic zone, then Russia would have to do the same from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's industrial heartland in the Donbas. Ukraine has secured a number of changes to an earlier 28-point draft plan, which was formulated by Steve Witkoff but widely seen as being favourable to Russia. Zelensky told reporters on Friday that the weekend talks in Florida would focus on several documents, including US security guarantees and a separate economic agreement. However, Zelensky has repeatedly said the question of territory has proved to be the most difficult issue to resolve, along with the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The White House has proposed Ukraine and Russia split the energy generated by the plant, the largest in Europe.

The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law.\n\nOn Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.\n\nBut the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.\n\nOn Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.\n\nThe 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.\n\nInvestigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.\n\nNajib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who has maintained his innocence but remains at large.\n\nBut the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib guilty of embezzlement in 2020.\n\nThat year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.\n\nHe was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term halved last year.\n\nThe latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013. Najib said he had believed the money was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah - a claim rejected by the judge on Friday.\n\nSeparately Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, was sentenced to ten years in jail in 2022 for bribery. She is free on bail pending an appeal against her conviction.\n\nThe scandal has had profound repercussions on Malaysian politics.

The [Pentagon] is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come …\n\n“Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation. Merry Christmas!”\n\nNigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said on Friday that the US strikes, which came after Trump had accused Nigeria’s government of failing to stop Christians being killed in the country, were “part of joint ongoing operations”.\n\nNigeria is officially secular and its population is almost evenly split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn attention from the religious right in the US, which has framed it as persecution. Nigeria’s government has pointed out that armed groups target Christians and Muslims.\n\nNigeria provided the intelligence for the airstrikes in Sokoto state, Tuggar told the country’s Channels Television on Friday. He said he had spoken to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for 19 minutes, then called the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, to get his go-ahead, before speaking to Rubio again for another five minutes.\n\n“We have been working closely with the Americans,” Tuggar said. “This is what we’ve always been hoping for, to work with the Americans, to work with other countries, to combat terrorism, to stop the death of innocent Nigerians … It’s a collaborative effort.”\n\nThe US military’s Africa Command (Africom) said the strikes in Sokoto state had been carried out in coordination with Nigerian authorities. An earlier Africom statement posted on X and then removed said they had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities.\n\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\n\n“I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”\n\nNeither the US nor the Nigerian authorities have said if anyone was killed in the airstrikes. Asked if there would be more, Tuggar said: “You can call it a new phase of an old conflict. For us it is something that is ongoing.”\n\nUS planes conducted surveillance missions over the region earlier this month. It is believed they were using an airport in neighbouring Ghana as a base.\n\nForests in Sokoto, which is bordered by Niger to the north, have been used as bases by gangs of armed bandits and members of Islamic State – Sahel Province (ISSP) , known locally as Lakurawa. Some analysts say the IS branch started when a group of herders joined together to fight bandits in the absence of state support. The state is mostly Muslim.\n\nClashes between Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of Nigeria have been aggravated by ethnicity and religion, but their roots lie in competition for land and water.\n\nPriests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.\n\nTuggar said the operation was about “protecting Nigerians and innocent lives”, not one religion or another. “The president emphasised yesterday, before he gave it the go-ahead, that it must be made clear that … it is a joint operation,” he said. “It is not targeting any religion, nor is it simply in the name of one religion or another.”\n\nA day before the Sokoto strikes, a Christmas Eve suicide bombing at a mosque in north-east Nigeria killed at least five people and left more than 30 seriously injured. The Nigerian army attributed the attack to the jihadist group Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in the region for almost two decades, mostly separate to the violence in the north-west.\n\nThere have been almost 6,000 incidents of violence in Nigeria in 2025, about half of them attacks targeting civilians, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (Acled), a non-profit conflict monitor. The state of Katsina, another Muslim-majority state two states to the east of Sokoto, had the highest number of incidents at 706. Sokoto had the fourth highest, 353.\n\nTrump positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in the 2024 US presidential election, campaigning on a promise of extricating Washington from decades of “endless wars”.\n\nHowever, the first year of his second term in the White House has been notable for a number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on countries including Yemen, Iran and Syria, as well as a huge military buildup in the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:41:45 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T15:27:37.920127"}

Somaliland controls the north-west tip of Somalia, where it operates a de facto state, and is bordered by Djibouti to the north and Ethiopia to the west and south.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office said the declaration was “in the spirit” of the Abraham accords, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and mostly Arab states signed in 2020.\n\nIt posted a video of Benjamin Netanyahu speaking via video call with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, in which he invited him to visit Israel and described the friendship between the two countries as “historic”. Abdullahi said he would be “glad to be in Jerusalem as soon as possible”.\n\nSa’ar said the recognition came after a year of dialogue between the two countries and that he had instructed Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs to immediately “institutionalise ties between the two countries”.\n\nIsraeli analysts have said that recognition of the breakaway state could be in Israel’s strategic interest, given Somaliland’s proximity to Yemen, where Israel has conducted extensive airstrikes against the Houthi rebels over the past two years.\n\nA report in November by the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli thinktank, said: “Somaliland’s territory could serve as a forward base for multiple missions: intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and their armament efforts; logistical support for Yemen’s legitimate government in its war against them; and a platform for direct operations against the Houthis.”\n\nThe Somaliland authorities already host a military base operated by the United Arab Emirates in Berbera, which has a military port and an airstrip for fighter jets and transport aircraft. Analysts have suggested that the base is a key part of the UAE’s anti-Houthi campaign in Yemen.\n\nSomaliland’s president revealed in May that US military officials, including the most senior officer in the Horn of Africa, had visited Somaliland and that another US delegation was expected to visit soon. “It’s a matter of time. Not if, but when and who will lead the recognition of Somaliland,” Abdullahi told the Guardian.\n\nProject 2025, which was published in 2023 and is alleged to have guided much of the doctrine of Donald Trump’s second administration, called for the recognition of Somaliland as a “hedge against the US’s deteriorating position in Djibouti”, where Chinese influence is growing.\n\nThis August, the Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz wrote to Trump asking him to recognise Somaliland. Cruz said Somaliland was an ally of Israel and that it had expressed support for the Abraham accords.\n\nThe US administration is reportedly split over the recognition of Somaliland, with some fearing such a move could endanger military cooperation with Somalia. The US has troops deployed there, where it supports Somali forces in their fight against the Islamist movement al-Shabaab.\n\nSomaliland has a population of a little more than 6.2 million. The breakaway state has a democratic system that has had peaceful transfers of power, though the Washington-based non-profit organisation Freedom House noted an “erosion of political rights and civic space” in recent years, with journalists and opposition figures facing repression from authorities.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:34:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:43:13.946860"}

He had been detained in jail two years beyond his five-year sentence as the Cairo authorities refused to recognise the period he held in pre-trial detention as part of his time served.\n\nA previous attempt by Abd el-Fattah to leave Cairo for London in November after his release from jail, was blocked by the security forces a month ago. He has since been trying to negotiate an agreement whereby he is allowed to travel freely between Cairo and London and not be permanently excluded from Egypt if he came to the UK.\n\nHis arrival in London was announced by his mother, Laila Soueif, on Facebook.\n\nHis sister Mona Seif said: “I can’t believe it’s finally happened and Alaa has made it to London. We thought it was impossible, but here he is. Hundreds of people around the world did so much to help bring this moment about. Alaa is free and we can finally begin to heal as a family.”\n\nThe family believe the agreement will allow him to travel back and forth between the UK and Egypt.\n\nJames Lynch of FairSquare, a human rights organisation that has worked alongside Abd el-Fattah’s family for several years, said: “I’m delighted that Alaa has safely returned to the UK to be reunited with his son after such a lengthy ordeal lasting well over a decade. After everything Alaa and his family have been through, I’m hopeful this marks the beginning of a new chapter for them.”\n\n0:57 Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah reunited with family after release from prison – video\n\nHis mother twice came close to death when she was admitted to hospital during an extended eight-month hunger strike designed to put pressure on the UK Foreign Office to do more to secure his release.\n\nThe British prime minister, Keir Starmer, made three calls to his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end his detention. But the Egyptians never allowed British consular visits to jail, saying they did not recognise his dual citizenship status.\n\nChanges in the Egyptian embassy in London may have helped produce a less inflexible stance.\n\nAbd el-Fattah, from a family of human rights activists, became a leading voice during the Arab spring. He has a direct, perceptive, non-sectarian writing style that has won him awards.\n\nHe has a teenage son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton and attends a special educational needs school. The boy visited him in Cairo soon after his release, in what was regarded as a successful reunion.\n\nAbd el-Fattah’s sister, Sana, explained at the time he had been blocked from flying out of Cairo: “We’re really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly.”\n\n“Khaled needs his father. My nephew … is very, very comfortable in his school and his setup in Brighton. We can’t change. We can’t keep creating instability.”\n\nHe had already served a five-year jail sentence passed in September 2019 on charges of “spreading false news” after a much-criticised trial, yet last year his family were told he would not be released until January 2027.\n\nStarmer made no criticism of the justice of Abd el-Fattah’s sentencing. “I’m delighted that Alaa is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief,” the prime minister wrote on social media. “I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment.\n\n“Alaa’s case has been a top priority for my government since we came to office.

Death to all Islamic terrorists! Thank you.”\n\nLoomer said she had been informed by the US defense department – which the Trump administration calls the war department – that the American cruise missile strikes carried out with the Nigerian government’s cooperation had been “a direct response to [IS] jihadi terrorists killing Christians in Nigeria”.\n\nThe US House member Randy Fine, a Florida Republican who in November supported a congressional resolution calling for Nigeria to be designated a “country of particular concern” due to its religious violence, described Thursday’s strikes as an “amazing Christmas present!”\n\n“With Muslim terrorists attacking Christians in Nigeria, Syria, and even Europe – simply for refusing to submit to Islam – the president is showing that we will no longer tolerate these barbarians,” Fine said on X, after suggesting earlier in December that “mainstream Muslims” should be “destroyed”.\n\nThe uniformity of the Republicans’ response comes in contrast to a campaign involving economic pressure as well as airstrikes on alleged drug boats that the Trump administration is waging on Venezuela to oust its president, Nicolás Maduro. Some Republicans have warned that the history of US “regime change” efforts are not promising and have warned against direct military strikes on Venezuela.\n\nAttacks on Christians by Islamic extremist groups in Nigeria such as Boko Haram had been drawing increased attention from US Christian groups that are generally aligned with Trump.\n\n“Do not test President Trump‘s resolved [sic] in this matter,” said a post from the Republican US House member Riley Moore of West Virginia, who introduced the Nigeria-related congressional resolution in November. “Tonight’s strike in coordination with the Nigerian government is just the first step to ending the slaughter of Christians and the security crisis affecting all Nigerians.”\n\nIn further comments on Friday, other Republican lawmakers praised Trump for carrying out the strikes. North Carolina senator Ted Budd, a Republican, said that IS “is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Christians & religious minorities in Nigeria”.\n\nBudd wrote that Trump’s “decisive strikes will save lives & protect religious freedom. May God bless our brave men & women in uniform.”\n\nCongressman Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who recently led a delegation to Nigeria, said that attitudes within the Nigerian government were “beginning to turn in favor of protecting Christians – in addition to taking actions against those terrorizing Christians and moderate Muslims”.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said on X that he commended the Trump administration as well as American troops for “these strikes against bloodthirsty [IS] savages who are not only persecuting Christians, but also have killed many Americans”.\n\nPressure on the administration to act in Nigeria had been building since July, when the US Commission on International Religious Freedom issued an advisory that said the Nigerian government was “often unable to prevent or slow to react to violent attacks by Fulani herders, bandit gangs, and insurgent entities such as JAS/Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)”.\n\nIn October, Ted Cruz – a Republican senator from Texas – said the US was able to identify the perpetrators of anti-Christian violence in Nigeria “and I intend to hold them accountable”. Cruz said that since 2009, “over 50,000 Christians in Nigeria have been massacred, and over 18,000 churches and 2,000 Christian schools have been destroyed”.\n\nAt the recent AmericaFest, a four-day gathering of US conservative organized by Turning Point USA, the Trinidadian rap star Nicki Minaj spoke with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, on the oppression of Christians in Nigeria. She said she loved Nigeria in part because her pastor is Nigerian.\n\n“Hearing that people are being kidnapped – while they’re in church, people are being kidnapped, people are being killed, brutalized, all because of their religion – that should spark outrage in America, and that’s what it’s doing,” Minaj said.\n\nThursday’s strikes in Nigeria come less than a week after the US hit more than 70 Islamic State networks and infrastructure in Syria in response to an attack that killed two American military service members as well as a civilian.\n\nAdm Brad Cooper, commander of the American military’s Central Command (Centcom), said the Syrian strikes were “critical to preventing [IS] from inspiring terrorist plots and attacks against the US homeland”.\n\nHegseth on Friday warned of additional US strikes against IS targets in northern Nigeria.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:50:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T18:37:41.632250"}

Both sides have agreed to freeze all troop movements and allow civilians living in border areas to return home, halting weeks of intense border clashes that have killed at least 41 people and displaced almost a million people. The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT). Once it has held for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand will also be released, the statement said. The breakthrough came after Thai and Cambodian officials held several days of talks aimed at ending fresh fighting between the two countries.\n\nThe joint statement outlines the terms of \"de-escalation\", which includes ceasing \"attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side\". \"Both sides must avoid unprovoked firing or advancement or movement of troops towards the other side's positions or troops,\" the statement said. The statement also said that the release of the 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand would be conducted \"in the spirit of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration\", an agreement between the two countries signed at a ceremony attended by US President Donald Trump in October. That ceasefire agreement was broken earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides have since blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce. The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani Province, and a Thai solider had been killed. Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate. Clashes have continued throughout December.

He is the candidate for the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), backed by Myanmar's military, in Aungmyaythazan, a constituency in the city of Mandalay. The crowd of 300-400 clutch the branded hats and flags they've been given, but soon wilt in the afternoon heat, some dozing off. Children run and play in between the rows of chairs. Many of these families are victims of the earthquake which badly damaged Mandalay and surrounding areas in March, and are hoping for a handout. They disappear the moment the rally finishes.\n\nA 'sham' election\n\nOn Sunday the people of Myanmar get their first opportunity to vote in an election since the military seized power in a coup nearly five years ago, setting off a devastating civil war. But the poll, already delayed many times by the ruling junta, is being widely condemned as a sham. The most popular party, the National League for Democracy, has been dissolved, and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is locked up in an undisclosed prison. Voting, which will happen in three stages over a period of a month, will not even be possible in large parts of the country still consumed by war. Even where voting is taking place, it is marred by a climate of fear and intimidation.\n\nWhen the BBC tried asking people at the rally in Mandalay what they thought of the election, we were told not to by party officials. They might say the wrong thing, one man explained – they don't know how to speak to journalists. The number of plain-clothes military intelligence officers present there helps explain their nervousness. In a dictatorship which has criminalised liking Facebook pages criticising the election, or using the word revolution, even these staunchly pro-military party activists feared the consequences of allowing a foreign journalist the chance to ask uncensored questions. The same fear lingers on the streets of Mandalay. At a market stall selling fresh river fish the customers all refused to answer what they thought of the election. We have no choice, so we have to vote, one said. The fish seller shooed us away. \"You will bring me trouble,\" she said. Only one woman was brave enough to speak frankly, but we needed to find a private place to meet, and to conceal her identity, just to hear her view of the election. \"This election is a lie,\" she said. \"Everyone is afraid. Everyone has lost their humanity and their freedom. So many people have died, been tortured or fled to other countries. If the military keeps running the country, how can things change?\" She would not vote, she said, but she knew that decision carried risks.\n\nLulu Luo/ BBC Most people we encountered did not want to discuss the election\n\nThe military authorities imposed a new law in July criminalising \"any speech, organising, inciting, protesting, or distributing leaflets in order to destroy a part of the electoral process\". Earlier this month Tayzar San, a doctor and one of the first to organise a protest against the 2021 coup, was also among the first to be charged under the law, after he distributed leaflets calling for a boycott of the election. The junta has offered a reward for information leading to his arrest. In September three young people in Yangon were given sentences of 42 to 49 years each for posting stickers showing a bullet and a ballot box together.\n\nTayzar San/Facebook Tayzar San distributing leaflets boycotting the election\n\n\"Co-operate and crush all those harming the union,\" commands a large red poster looming over the families and couples enjoying a late afternoon stroll under the old red-brick walls of the royal palace in Mandalay. In this menacing climate anything approaching a free vote is unimaginable.\n\nA general's gambit\n\nYet the junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has a spring in his step these days. He seems confident this extraordinary election, where there will be no voting at all in as much as one half of the country, will give him the legitimacy he has failed to acquire during his five catastrophic years in power. He even attended a Christmas mass in Yangon's cathedral and condemned the \"hatred and resentment between individuals\" which led to \"domination, oppression, and violence in human communities\". This, from a man charged by the UN and human rights groups with genocide against Muslim Rohingyas, whose coup set off a civil war which, according to the data analysis group ACLED, has killed 90,000 people.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing\n\nMin Aung Hlaing's election gambit has the full diplomatic support of China, which, bizarrely for a one-party state, is giving technical and financial support for this multi-party exercise. It is likely to be reluctantly accepted in the rest of Asia too. His army, newly equipped with Chinese and Russian weapons, has been regaining ground lost over the past two years to the various armed groups opposing the coup. He is clearly hoping to include more reconquered territory in the third stage of the election at the end of January. With Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD out of the picture his USDP is all but guaranteed to win. In the last, free election in 2020, the USDP won only six percent of parliamentary seats. Some observers have noted that Min Aung Hlaing is not popular even within his own regime, or his own party, where his leadership qualities are questioned. He will probably keep the presidency after the election, but his power will, to some extent, be diluted by the resumption of parliamentary politics, albeit without most of the parties that won seats in the 2020 election. The election is clearly viewed by China as an off-ramp, a way for the military to get out of the destructive deadlock caused by its ill-judged coup.\n\n'No-one is ready to compromise'\n\nEven a short distance from the apparently peaceful city life of Mandalay, the deep scars left by Myanmar's civil war, which is still far from over, are visible. On the opposite side of the Irrawaddy River lies the spectacular temple complex at Mingun, once a popular tourist attraction. Getting there requires a short drive along a riverside road, but for the past four years this, like much of the area around Mandalay, has been contested territory, where volunteer People's Defence Forces control many villages and launch ambushes against army convoys. To reach Mingun we needed to get through several checkpoints. We sat in a tea shop with the local police commander to negotiate our passage. He was a young man, wearing the huge strain of his job on his face. He had a revolver stuck in the back of his trousers, and two even younger men – boys, perhaps - carrying military-issue assault rifles sat close by as his bodyguards.\n\nLulu Luo/ BBC Many young men have taken up arms on both sides of this conflict\n\nHe said he had to carry these weapons just to move about the village. On his phone were images of his opponents: young men, raggedly dressed, with an assortment of weapons they may have smuggled from border regions of Myanmar or obtained from dead soldiers and police officers. One group, calling itself the Unicorn Guerrilla Force, was his toughest adversary. They never negotiated, he said. \"If we see each other we always shoot. That's the way it is.\" The election, he added, would not be taking place in most of the villages to the north of him. \"Everyone here has taken sides in this conflict. It is so complicated and difficult. But no-one is ready to compromise.\" After an hour we were told it would be too dangerous to reach Mingun.

His actions triggered widespread protests and criticism from opposition groups and civil society, most of whom doubted his vow not to personally run for office.\n\nOn Sunday, 6.7 million eligible voters in Guinea will head to the ballot box for the first presidential election since the 2021 coup. Among the nine candidates are the former minister Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea and the former junta supporter turned critic Faya Millimono of the Liberal Bloc party.\n\nBut thanks to a controversial referendum in September that led to the adoption of a new constitution allowing him to run and extending presidential terms from five to seven years, the clear frontrunner is Doumbouya.\n\nThe opposition coalition Forces vives de Guinée has called his candidacy a betrayal. “The man who presented himself as the restorer of democracy chose to become its gravedigger,” it said in a statement last month after Doumbouya officially deposited his intent to run with the supreme court.\n\nPolitical upheavals have been a recurring feature in west Africa, a region that has earned the moniker of “coup belt” after seven successful coups and several unsuccessful attempts since 2020. While Guinea has remained under the Ecowas umbrella, fellow juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, angered by its post-coup sanctions, have split from the regional bloc to form the pro-Russian Alliance of Sahel States (AES). If it holds, the Guinean election will be the first in any of the junta-run states since 2020.\n\nView image in fullscreen A campaign billboard in Conakry of the Guinean presidential candidate Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea. Photograph: Souleymane Camara/Reuters\n\nWithin Guinea, many believe the general’s victory is a foregone conclusion, given his consolidation of power since ascending to the presidency and promoting himself to a general. Even now, the presidential race is notable not for those who are on the ballot, but for those who are not.\n\nThe biggest opposition parties remain suspended, and their most prominent leaders have been detained, barred from running or – like the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, are in exile. Many say a climate of fear pervades the country due to the junta’s crackdown against its critics, with several dissidents in jail.\n\nConversely, Doumbouya pardoned the former dictator Moussa Dadis Camara who was given a 20-year sentence for his role in one of Guinea’s most serious human rights atrocities: the 2009 massacre and mass rape of protesters at a stadium in Conakry. The pardon, granted before the final hearing, prompted several human rights groups to write a joint open letter to the junta leader alongside families of victims, urging him to reconsider. That process is now in limbo.\n\nAhead of the vote, Doumbouya has been accumulating goodwill.This month, the shiny new Simandou mine, which has the world’s largest untapped reserve of iron ore, was launched after nearly three decades of delays caused by political instability and corruption. Doumbouya’s government is touting the project as a bridge to prosperity for Guinea and a sign of incoming development, despite mass job losses and environmental complaints.\n\nThe election stakes are high: in the coming years, the multi-layered Simandou mine project – which also includes the construction of ports and a railway – is expected to transform the economy of Guinea, where half of the population lives on below $2 a day. Given existential concerns around transparency, many are waiting to see what the winning government does after the election.\n\n“Our salvation lies in a return to the [proper] constitutional order,” said Abdoulaye Koroma, a presidential candidate for the Rally for Renaissance and Development party.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 08:00:33 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T08:34:44.488389"}

Dologuélé was the runner-up in the last two elections – 2015 and 2020 – while Dondra briefly served under the president.\n\nThe opposition hopes to tap into the frustrations of people living in a country where conflict is a daily reality. More than half a million people remain internally displaced within CAR, with a similar number living as refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, Touadéra, a former mathematics professor who has been in power since 2016, is widely expected to extend his run in office.\n\nHe went from an academic to a statesman after the then-president, François Bozizé, appointed him prime minister in 2008. Touadéra stayed in that role until 2013, when the administration was toppled by a rebel coalition, as sectarian violence triggered a civil war.\n\nAfter a chaotic three-year transition, Touadéra ran for office, and the perception that he was neutral, independent of the ex-Séléka and anti-Balaka militias, powered his second-round victory.\n\nA peace accord was signed in April with the two main rebel groups, and there is hope the country might be slowly stabilising. There had been “tangible progress to establish peace”, said Lewis Mudge, the central Africa director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAbdou Abarry, the head of the UN regional 0ffice for central Africa (Unoca) agreed, although added there were still challenges. “This is an opportunity to commend the remarkable recovery of the country, which is laying the foundations for peace consolidation among domestic actors and has undertaken measures to secure its borders, notably with Chad and Cameroon,” he told the UN security council this month.\n\nStill, there are concerns that supply-chain issues and violence could disrupt the vote, especially in some rural areas. The UN peacekeeping mission Minusca, whose mandate was recently renewed until next year, is providing the security and logistical support the state’s crumbling infrastructure cannot manage.\n\nThere are claims the voter list was only published online, and not physically, even though most people have no internet access or electricity. The electoral issues have led to a band of opposition politicians announcing a boycott.\n\nAccording to Mudge, the irregularities could “disenfranchise large segments of the population” and undercut the integrity of the process.\n\nMany people worry that another Touadéra term – a 2023 constitutional referendum not only scrapped term limits but extended presidential mandates from five to seven years – would mean more free roaming for outside interests.\n\nAfter taking office, Touadéra put faith in the Russian mercenary firm Wagner, which provides part of his private security, while Minusca and Rwandan troops helped secure the countryside. Since its arrival in 2018, Wagner’s influence within CAR has grown such that despite the founder Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death, Touadéra has resisted Moscow’s calls to integrate the military contractors within Africa Corps, its successor entity.\n\nRwanda, where the government often mentions the need for “African solutions to African problems”, has taken a different approach from Russia, focusing on smaller business interests in CAR.\n\nIn August, a pro-opposition media outlet claimed the government had evicted its own soldiers from a World Bank-funded youth training centre in Nzila, a village on the outskirts of the capital, Bangui, to clear the way for Rwandan troops to engage in a large livestock farming operation.\n\n“Touadéra is determined to sell off the country piece by piece and sacrifice the youth of the Central African Republic,” the editorial read.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T05:30:45.412106"}

The military government is holding a phased ballot nearly five years after it seized power in a coup, which sparked widespread opposition and spiralled into a civil war. Observers say the junta, with China's support, is seeking to legitimise and entrench its power as it seeks a way out of the devastating stalemate. More than 200 people have been charged for disrupting or opposing the polls under a new law which carries severe punishments, including the death penalty.\n\nPolling began on Sunday after reports of explosions in at least two regions of Myanmar. Three people were taken to hospital following a rocket attack on an uninhabited house in the Mandalay region in the early hours of Sunday, the chief minister of the region confirmed to the BBC. One of those people is in a serious condition. Separately, more than ten houses were damaged in the Myawaddy township, near the border with Thailand, following a series of explosions late on Saturday. A local resident told the BBC that a child was killed in the attack, and three people were taken to hospital in an emergency condition. Voters have told the BBC that the election feels more \"disciplined and systematic\" than those previously. \"The experience of voting has changed a lot,\" said Ma Su ZarChi, who lives in the Mandalay region. \"Before I voted, I was afraid. Now that I have voted, I feel relieved. I cast my ballot as someone who has tried their best for the country.\" First-time voter Ei Pyay Phyo Maung, 22, told the BBC she was casting her ballot because she believed that voting is \"the responsibility of every citizen\". \"My hope is for the lower classes - right now, the prices of goods are skyrocketing, and I want to support someone who can bring them down for those struggling the most,\" she said. \"I want a president who provides equally for all people.\"\n\nThe Burmese junta has rejected criticism of the polls, maintaining that it aims to \"return [the country] to a multi-party democratic system\". After casting his vote at a highly fortified polling station in the capital, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing told the BBC that the election would be free and fair. \"I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, a civil servant. I can't just say that I want to be president,\" he said, stressing that there are three phases of the election. Earlier this week, he warned that those who refuse to vote are rejecting \"progress toward democracy\".\n\nWin Kyaw Thu/BBC Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing cast his ballot in the capital Nay Pyi Taw\n\nFilm director Mike Tee, actor Kyaw Win Htut and comedian Ohn Daing were among the prominent figures convicted under the law against disrupting polls, which was enacted in July.

Civilians are \"being coerced from all sides\", Mr Türk said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that armed rebel groups have issued their own threats asking people to boycott the polls. The military has been fighting on several fronts, against both armed resistance groups who oppose the coup, as well as ethnic armies which have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year following relentless airstrikes enabled by support from China and Russia.

On screen, she was a French cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality. One publication called her \"the princess of pout and the countess of come hither\", but it was an image she grew to loathe. Ruthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress. Eventually, she abandoned her career to campaign for animal welfare. Years later, her reputation was damaged when she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred. Her son also sued her for emotional damage after she said she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\". It was a scar on the memory of an icon, who - in her prime - put the bikini, female desire, and French cinema on the map.\n\nLido/Shutterstock Bardot helped to make the bikini socially acceptable in the 1950s\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris on 28 September 1934. She and her sister, Marie-Jeanne, grew up in a luxurious apartment in the plushest district of the city. Her Catholic parents were wealthy and pious, and demanded high standards of their children. The girls' friendships were closely policed. When they broke their parent's favourite vase, they were whipped as a punishment.\n\nRoger Viollet via Getty Images Her parents wanted Brigitte Bardot to become a ballet dancer\n\nWith German troops occupying Paris during World War II, Bardot spent most of her time at home, dancing to records. Her mother encouraged her interest and enrolled her in ballet classes from the age of seven. Her teacher at the Paris Conservatoire described her as an outstanding pupil, and she went on to win awards.\n\nLife as a 'jeune fille'\n\nBut Bardot found life claustrophobic. By the age of 15, she later recalled, \"I was seeking something, perhaps a fulfilment of myself.\" A family friend persuaded her to pose for the cover of Elle, the leading women's magazine in France, and the photographs caused a sensation.\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images Brigitte Bardot's early magazine covers redefined fashion and the concept of beauty\n\nAt the time, fashionable women had short hair, carefully matched their accessories, and sported tailored jackets and silky evening wear. Brigitte's hair flowed around her shoulders. With the lithe, athletic body of the ballerina, she was nothing like her fellow models. Pictured in a series of young, modish outfits, she became the personification of a new \"jeune fille\" (young girl) style. At the age of 16, she found herself the most famous cover girl in Paris. Her pictures caught the attention of the film director Marc Allegret, who instructed his assistant, Roger Vadim, to track her down.\n\nQUINIO/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was infatuated with aspiring director Roger Vadim\n\nThe screen tests were not successful, but Vadim - who was six years older - took her on, first as his protégé and then as his fiancée. They began an intense affair, but when Bardot's parents found out, they threatened to send her away to England.\n\nS.N. Pathe Cinema/Getty Images Roger Vadim helped his teenage wife launch her film career\n\nRoger Vadim, her 'wild wolf'\n\nIn retaliation, she attempted to take her own life, but was discovered and stopped just in time. Brigitte was infatuated with the aspiring director. He seemed to her as a \"wild wolf\". \"He looked at me, scared me, attracted me, and I didn't know where I was anymore,\" she later explained.\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images Bardot and Vadim on their wedding day at the Church of Passy, Paris, 12 December 1952. Vadim sold the pictures of the ceremony to Paris-Match\n\nUnder such pressure, her parents relented, but forbade the couple from marrying until Brigitte was 18. As soon as that milestone was passed, the couple walked down the aisle.\n\nBecoming an icon\n\nVadim began to mould Bardot into the star that he believed she could be. He sold the pictures of their wedding to Paris-Match and instructed her in how to perform in public. He helped his new wife find small roles in a dozen minor films, often playing pouty-yet-innocent female love interests. But, until 1956, she was chiefly famous for posing in bikinis - until then a garment banned in Spain, Italy and much of America for being on the razor edge of decency - and popularising a beehive hairdo. Then came peroxide, and the part that made her a star. That year, Vadim's debut film, And God Created Woman, opened in Paris. It failed to make money in France, but caused uproar in the United States.\n\nMarka/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Bardot created uproar in And God Created Woman\n\nIn a country used to Doris Day, Bardot was a sensation. Her character pursues her sexual appetites, without shame, as men do. She dances barefoot in a trance, her skin glowing with sweat, with her hair worn wild and loose. Her lack of inhibition causes social order to collapse; outside the cinema, the reaction was just as intense. The existentialist Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\" - raising Brigitte to the status of a philosophy. But the American moral majority mobilised. The film was banned in some states, and newspapers denounced its depravity. To audiences, Bardot became indistinguishable from the character she played. Paris-Match branded her \"immoral from head to toe\". And when Bardot ran off with her co-star, Jean-Louis Trintignant, her image as a wanton libertine was inescapable.\n\nAtlantis Films/Pictorial Parade/Courtesy of Getty Images Existentialist philosophers hailed Bardot as an icon of \"absolute freedom\"\n\nShe divorced Vadim, who reacted as only a Frenchman could. \"I prefer to have that kind of wife,\" he said, \"knowing she is unfaithful, rather than possess a woman who just loved me and no-one else.\" He went on to work with Bardot again, and later live with Catherine Deneuve and marry Jane Fonda.\n\nA reluctant mother\n\nIn 1959, Brigitte - after several love affairs - married the actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she starred in Babette Goes To War. The couple had a son, Nicolas, but Bardot resented her pregnancy: repeatedly punching herself in the stomach and begging a doctor for morphine to induce a miscarriage. \"I looked at my flat, slender belly in the mirror like a dear friend upon whom I was about to close a coffin lid,\" she later recalled.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Bardot resented her pregnancy and was later sued by her son for emotional damage\n\nAfter the inevitable divorce, Nicolas did not see his mother for decades. He sued Bardot for emotional damage when she published an autobiography in which she stated that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\". Brigitte was now the highest paid actress in France, with some suggesting that she was more valuable in terms of foreign trade than the country's car industry. But she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress. \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\" She began to attract the attention of Europe's most respected film-makers, winning critical acclaim in Jean-Luc Godard's powerful, New Wave drama, Le Mépris (Contempt). But the overall quality of her output was mixed, especially when she ventured outside France and into Hollywood. A third marriage, to a millionaire German playboy, was followed by a string of lovers - although, uncharacteristically, she did reject Sean Connery.\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images Bardot grew tired of her sex kitten image and quit acting to campaign for animal welfare. \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\"\n\nShe made dozens of records, alongside Serge Gainsbourg and Sacha Distel. With Gainsbourg, she recorded the raunchy Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus, although she begged him not to release it. A year later, he re-recorded the song with the British actress, Jane Birkin. It became a huge hit all over Europe, with Bardot's version remaining under wraps for 20 years.\n\nAnimal rights campaigner\n\nAfter nearly 50 films, she announced she was retiring to devote her life to animal welfare in 1973. \"I gave my beauty and my youth to men\", she said. \"I'm going to give my wisdom and experience to animals\".\n\nPhilippe Caron/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nShe raised 3m francs (then about £300,000) to establish the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, by auctioning off her jewellery and film memorabilia. Bardot - or B.B. as she was known in France - campaigned against the annual seal cull in Canada, and irritated some of her countrymen by condemning the eating of horse meat. She became a vegetarian, attacked the Chinese government for \"torturing\" bears, and spent hundreds of thousands on a programme to sterilise Romanian stray dogs.\n\nSygma via Getty Images Bardot campaigned against the culling of seals and the fur trade, among other issues\n\nA troubled end to a troubled life\n\nIn her later years, she was prosecuted on multiple occasions for racial hatred. She objected to the way the Islamic and Jewish faiths slaughter animals for food. But the way she voiced her criticism was unforgivable, and - indeed - illegal. In 1999, she wrote that \"my homeland is invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims\". This landed Bardot with a huge fine. She went on to criticise interracial marriages and insult gay men who, in her words, \"jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air, and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through\". Bardot was in court so often that, in 2008, the prosecutor declared that he was \"weary\" of charging her.\n\nGilles BASSIGNAC/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was in court so often that the prosecutor said he was \"weary\" of charging her", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:18:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T10:27:02.614782"}

The cinema icon - BB as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare. Paying tribute, President Emmanuel Macron said France is mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\". Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.\n\nIn a statement, the animal welfare foundation she established said it was announcing her death with \"immense sadness\". The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said she was \"a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation.\" It did not specify where or when Bardot died. In a tribute on social media, President Macron wrote: \"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. \"French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.\" Another who paid tribute was French far-right politician Marine Le Pen: \"France loses an exceptional woman, through her talent, her courage, her frankness, her beauty.\" Bardot's husband, whom she married in 1992, was Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the late far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen - the father of Marine.\n\nHerbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty Images Bardot tore up the rule book of French cinema in the 1950s\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris in 1934 to a wealthy family, who wanted her to become a ballerina. She was discovered in her teens after posing on the cover of Elle magazine, swiftly becoming a sensation in her home country, and was persuaded to enter the cinema world. She played iconic roles, the most notable in the 1956 film And God Created Woman, directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim, in which she played a sexually liberated woman. The film scandalised the American public and was banned in some US states, while the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\".\n\nThrough the late 1950s and 1960s, she became a global phenomenon with roles in The Truth, earning critical acclaim for her dramatic depth; Contempt, a Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece; and Viva Maria!, showcasing her comedic flair alongside Jeanne Moreau. Beyond her most iconic roles, Bardot showcased her versatility in films like Love on a Pillow, where she portrayed a complex, emotionally-torn character, and Two Weeks in September, a romantic drama that highlighted her ability to convey vulnerability. In The Bear and the Doll, she brought playful charm to a comedic role, proving her range across genres. These films, though less celebrated, underscored her ability to captivate audiences in diverse narratives. As well as her work in film, Bardot will also be remembered as a fashion icon, with her blonde tousled hair and bold eyeliner setting beauty trends worldwide. After wearing an off-the-shoulder number in Cannes in 1953, similar styles became known as the Bardot neckline. She was married four times and had one son, Nicolas, with French actor and film producer Jacques Charrier, who died in September. Nicolas later sued his mother for emotional damage after she wrote in an autobiography that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\".\n\nKeystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images Bardot, Jacques Charrier and their three-day-old son Nicolas in 1960\n\nRuthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress. At the height of her fame, she announced she was retiring at the age of 39 to devote her life to animal welfare. \"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals,\" Bardot famously declared. In 1986, she launched the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which works to protect wild and domestic animals. She became a vegetarian, and in 2013 even threatened to apply for Russian citizenship in protest against plans to kill two sick elephants in a French zoo. Reacting to her death, France's oldest animal protection association - The Société Protectrice des Animaux - paid tribute to an \"iconic and passionate figure for the animal cause\".\n\nCharly Hel/Prestige/Getty Images Bardot, pictured here in 2001, became an increasingly controversial figure in her later life", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:34:26 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T14:24:54.688115"}

This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nIt is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.\n\nKurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.\n\nArben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.\n\nThere is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.\n\nRepairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.\n\nThe EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.\n\nThe fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.\n\nOne analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power.\n\nBut he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:27:02 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T02:22:43.143033"}

The army, navy, air force and rocket force would be dispatched for the drills scheduled for Tuesday, which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said. Codenamed \"Justice Mission 2025\", the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms. Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.\n\nTaiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms. Taiwan's defence ministry said that they detected Chinese aircraft and ships around Taiwan on Monday morning, and have deployed their own forces and missile systems to monitor the situation. Its forces are on \"high alert\" to defend Taiwan and \"protect our people\", the ministry said. In a post on Weibo, the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command - in charge of the Taiwan Strait - described the upcoming military exercise as a \"shield of justice\". \"All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield!\" the post read. While China has long called for the \"peaceful reunification\" with Taiwan, it also has a law stating it will resort to \"non-peaceful means\" to prevent the island's \"secession\". Beijing has accused Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te of pursuing \"Taiwan independence\". The president maintains Taiwan is already a sovereign nation and therefore has no need to formally declare independence. On Sunday, Lai said in a local television interview that Taiwan needed to \"keep raising the difficulty so [China] can never meet the standard\" for an invasion. He also said that his administration was committed to \"maintaining the status quo\" and would not provoke China - though he added that peace relies on \"real strength\". Polls consistently show that most Taiwanese people want the \"status quo\", meaning they neither want to unify with China, nor to formally declare independence.\n\nCCTV Chinese state media published a map released by the military showing Tuesday's drill locations around Taiwan\n\nSince 2022 Beijing has ramped up military drills in the Taiwan Strait, usually in response to what it deems as threats such as former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and Lai's inauguration in 2024. China's last live-fire exercise in the Taiwan Strait, held in April, simulated strikes on key ports and energy facilities, the People's Liberation Army said at the time. Along with the drills, the Chinese military released a series of cartoons depicting Lai as a \"parasite\". This week's military drills are the first to be held under Yang Zhibin, the new chief of the Eastern Theater Command who assumed his role in October. Taiwan holds military exercises of its own, both to prepare its population for an attack and showcase its defences to Beijing. This year's Han Kuang exercise, which took place over 10 days, was the largest and longest one yet. Since taking office, Lai has vowed to boost defence spending and enhance the island's defence capabilities in the face of increasing tensions with Beijing.

I watched the Cold War reach its height, then simply evaporate. But I've never seen a year quite as worrying as 2025 has been - not just because several major conflicts are raging but because it is becoming clear that one of them has geopolitical implications of unparalleled importance. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the current conflict in his country could escalate into a world war. After nearly 60 years of observing conflict, I've got a nasty feeling he's right.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Ukraine's President has warned that the current conflict in Ukraine could escalate into a world war\n\nNato governments are on high alert for any signs that Russia is cutting the undersea cables that carry the electronic traffic that keeps Western society going. Their drones are accused of testing the defences of Nato countries. Their hackers develop ways of putting ministries, emergency services and huge corporations out of operation. Authorities in the west are certain Russia's secret services murder and attempt to murder dissidents who have taken refuge in the West. An inquiry into the attempted murder in Salisbury of the former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skrypal in 2018 (plus the actual fatal poisoning of a local woman, Dawn Sturgess) concluded that the attack had been agreed at the highest level in Russia. That means President Putin himself.\n\nThis time feels different\n\nThe year 2025 has been marked by three very different wars. There is Ukraine of course, where the UN says 14,000 civilians have died. In Gaza, where Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu promised \"mighty vengeance\" after about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 and 251 people were taken hostage. Since then, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action, including more than 30,000 women and children according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry – figures the UN considers reliable. Meanwhile there has been a ferocious civil war between two military factions in Sudan. More than 150,000 people have been killed there over the past couple of years; around 12 million have been forced out of their homes. Maybe, if this had been the only war in 2025, the outside world would have done more to stop it; but it wasn't. \"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump, as his aircraft flew him to Israel after he had negotiated a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting. It's true that fewer people are dying in Gaza now. Despite the ceasefire, the Gaza war certainly doesn't feel as though it's been solved. Given the appalling suffering in the Middle East it may sound strange to say the war in Ukraine is on a completely different level to this. But it is.\n\nAFP via Getty Images \"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump\n\nThe Cold War aside, most of the conflicts I've covered over the years have been small-scale affairs: nasty and dangerous, certainly, but not serious enough to threaten the peace of the entire world. Some conflicts, such as Vietnam, the first Gulf War, and the war in Kosovo, did occasionally look as though they might tip over into something much worse, but they never did. The great powers were too nervous about the dangers that a localised, conventional war might turn into a nuclear one. \"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,\" the British Gen Sir Mike Jackson reportedly shouted over his radio in Kosovo in 1999, when his Nato superior ordered British and French forces to seize an airfield in Pristina after the Russian troops had got there first. In the coming year, 2026, though, Russia, noting President Trump's apparent lack of interest in Europe, seems ready and willing to push for much greater dominance. Earlier this month, Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to. At a later televised event he said: \"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours\".\n\nGetty Images Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to\n\nBut already Russia, a major world power, has invaded an independent European country, resulting in huge numbers of civilian and also military deaths. It is accused by Ukraine of kidnapping at least 20,000 children. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his involvement in this, something Russia has always denied. Russia says it invaded in order to protect itself against Nato encroachment, but President Putin has indicated another motive: the desire to restore Russia's regional sphere of influence.\n\nAmerican disapproval\n\nHe is gratefully aware that this last year, 2025, has seen something most Western countries had regarded as unthinkable: the possibility that an American president might turn his back on the strategic system which has been in force ever since World War Two. Not only is Washington now uncertain it wants to protect Europe, it disapproves of the direction it believes Europe is heading in. The Trump administration's new national security strategy report claims Europe now faces the \"stark prospect of civilisational erasure\". The Kremlin welcomed the report, saying it is consistent with Russia's own vision. You bet it is. Inside Russia, Putin has silenced most internal opposition to himself and to the Ukraine war, according to the UN special rapporteur focusing on human rights in Russia. He's got his own problems, though: the possibility of inflation rising again after a recent cooling, oil revenues falling, and his government having had to raise VAT to help pay for the war.\n\nGetty Images US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky clashed during a meeting at the White House in February 2025\n\nThe economies of the European Union are 10 times bigger than Russia's; even more than that if you add the UK. The combined European population of 450 million, is over three times Russia's 145 million. Still, Western Europe has seemed nervous of losing its creature comforts, and was until recently reluctant to pay for its own defence as long as America can be persuaded to protect it. America, too, is different nowadays: less influential, more inward-looking, and increasingly different from the America I've reported on for my entire career. Now, very much as in the 1920s and 30s, it wants to concentrate on its own national interests. Even if President Trump loses a lot of his political strength at next year's mid-term elections, he may have shifted the dial so far towards isolationism that even a more Nato-minded American president in 2028 might find it hard to come to Europe's aid. Don't think Vladimir Putin hasn't noticed that.\n\nThe risk of escalation\n\nThe coming year, 2026, does look as though it'll be important. Zelensky may well feel obliged to agree to a peace deal, carving off a large part of Ukrainian territory. Will there be enough bankable guarantees to stop President Putin coming back for more in a few years' time? For Ukraine and its European supporters, already feeling that they are at war with Russia, that's an important question. Europe will have to take over a far greater share of keeping Ukraine going, but if the United States turns its back on Ukraine, as it sometimes threatens to do, that will be a colossal burden.\n\nGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty Images If the United States turns its back on Ukraine, that will be a colossal burden for Europe\n\nBut could the war turn into a nuclear confrontation? We know President Putin is a gambler; a more careful leader would have shied away from invading Ukraine in February 2022. His henchmen make bloodcurdling threats about wiping the UK and other European countries off the map with Russia's vaunted new weapons, but he's usually much more restrained himself. While the Americans are still active members of Nato, the risk that they could respond with a devastating nuclear attack of their own is still too great. For now.\n\nChina's global role\n\nAs for China, President Xi Jinping has made few outright threats against the self-governed island of Taiwan recently. But two years ago the then director of the CIA William Burns said Xi Jinping had ordered the People's Liberation Army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. If China doesn't take some sort of decisive action to claim Taiwan, Xi Jinping could consider this to look pretty feeble. He won't want that. You might think that China is too strong and wealthy nowadays to worry about domestic public opinion. Not so. Ever since the uprising against Deng Xiaoping in 1989, which ended with the Tiananmen massacre, Chinese leaders have monitored the way the country reacts with obsessive care. I watched the events unfold in Tiananmen myself, reporting and even sometimes living in the Square.\n\nAFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool President Xi Jinping (centre) has made few outright threats against Taiwan recently\n\nThe story of 4 June 1989 wasn't as simple as we thought at the time: armed soldiers shooting down unarmed students. That certainly happened, but there was another battle going on in Beijing and many other Chinese cities. Thousands of ordinary working-class people came out onto the streets, determined to use the attack on the students as a chance to overthrow the control of the Chinese Communist Party altogether. When I drove through the streets two days later, I saw at least five police stations and three local security police headquarters burned out. In one suburb the angry crowd had set fire to a policeman and propped up his charred body against a wall. A uniform cap was put at a jaunty angle on his head, and a cigarette had been stuck between his blackened lips. It turns out the army wasn't just putting down a long-standing demonstration by students, it was stamping out a popular uprising by ordinary Chinese people. China's political leadership, still unable to bury the memories of what happened 36 years ago, is constantly on the look-out for signs of opposition - whether from organised groups like Falun Gong or the independent Christian church or the democracy movement in Hong Kong, or just people demonstrating against local corruption. All are stamped on with great force. I have spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989, watching its rise to economic and political dominance. I even came to know a top politician who was Xi Jinping's rival and competitor. His name was Bo Xilai, and he was an anglophile who spoke surprisingly openly about China's politics. He once said to me, \"You'll never understand how insecure a government feels when it knows it hasn't been elected.\" As for Bo Xilai, he was jailed for life in 2013 after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.\n\nJohn Simpson has spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989 (pictured in Tiananmen Square, 2016)\n\nAltogether, then, 2026 looks like being an important year. China's strength will grow, and its strategy for taking over Taiwan - Xi Jinping's great ambition - will become clearer. It may be that the war in Ukraine will be settled, but on terms that are favourable to President Putin. He may be free to come back for more Ukrainian territory when he's ready. And President Trump, even though his political wings could be clipped in November's mid-term elections, will distance the US from Europe even more. From the European point of view, the outlook could scarcely be more gloomy. If you thought World War Three would be a shooting-match with nuclear weapons, think again. It's much more likely to be a collection of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, which will see autocracy flourish. It could even threaten to break up the Western alliance. And the process has already started.

While both the US and Ukrainian presidents described the talks as \"great\", Trump reiterated that a key sticking point was the question of territory. Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine hand over more land. Addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky said they had come to an agreement on \"90%\" of a 20-point peace plan, while Trump said a security guarantee for Ukraine was \"close to 95%\" done. Zelensky later said US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week for further talks on issues aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nReuters\n\n\"We had a substantive conversation on all issues and highly value the progress that the Ukrainian and American teams have made over the past weeks,\" Zelensky said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. A proposal to turn the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Russia largely controls, into a demilitarised zone remains \"unresolved\", Trump said. \"Some of that land has been taken,\" he told reporters after the meeting. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months.\" Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas. Russia wants Ukraine to pull back from the small part of the territory it still controls in Donbas, while Kyiv has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by Ukrainian forces. The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back. He later reversed course. \"[That] is a very tough issue,\" he said. \"One that will get resolved.\" Security guarantees for Ukraine are \"95% done\", Trump said, without formally committing to logistical support or troop deployment to help protect Ukraine from future attacks. Trump floated the possibility of trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine, saying it could happen \"at the right time\". While the US president is keen to add the Ukraine-Russia war to the list of conflicts he claims to have ended, he cautioned that stalled or scrapped talks that go \"really badly\" could mean that the war continues.\n\nTrump: Agreement on Donbas 'unresolved' but 'getting closer'", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 02:06:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T06:50:56.089553"}

That is how it is for Ahmed, 18. He emerges from a mosque in the heart of Gaziantep in south-east Turkey - not far from the Syrian border - wearing a black T-shirt with \"Syria\" written on the front. His family fled his homeland when he was five years old, but he is planning to go back in a year or two at most. \"I am impatient to get there,\" he tells me. \"I am trying to save money first, because wages in Syria are low.\" Still, he insists the future will be better there. \"Syria will be rebuilt and it will be like gold,\" he says.\n\nIf he goes back, he will be following in the footsteps of more than half a million Syrians who have left Turkey since the ousting of Syria's long-time dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in December 2024. Many had been here since 2011, when civil war began devouring their country. In the years that followed, Turkey became a safe haven, taking in more Syrians than any other country. The number reached 3.5 million at its peak, causing political tension and - on occasion - xenophobic attacks. Officially, no Syrian will be forced to go, but some feel they are being pushed - by bureaucratic changes, and by a waning welcome. Civil society organisations \"are getting the message from the authorities that it's time to go\", says a Syrian woman who did not want to be named. \"I have a lot of good Turkish friends. Even they and my neighbours have asked why I am still here. Of course we will go back, but in an organised way. If we all go back together, it will be chaos.\"\n\nGetty Images Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December 2024\n\nAya Mustafa, 32, is eager to leave - but not yet. We meet under a winter sun by the stone walls of a castle, which has towered over Gaziantep since the Byzantine era. Her hometown, Aleppo, is less than two hours' drive away. She says going back is a constant topic of conversation in the Syrian community. \"Every day, every hour, we speak about this point,\" says Aya, whose family were lawyers and teachers back home, but had to start again in Turkey, baking and hairdressing to earn a living. \"We are talking about how we can return, and when, and what we can do. But there are many challenges, to be honest. Many families have children who were born here and can't even speak Arabic.\" Then there is the level of destruction in new Syria - where war has done its worst - and where the interim president, Ahmed Al Sharaa, is a former senior leader of Al Qaeda who has worked to reinvent his image. Aya saw the ruins of Aleppo for herself when she went back to visit. Her family home is still standing but now occupied by someone else. \"It's a big decision to go back to Syria,\" she says, \"especially for people with elderly relatives. I have my grandmother and my disabled sister. We need the basics like electricity and water and jobs to survive there.\" For now, she says, her family can't survive in Syria, but they will return in time. \"We believe that day will come,\" she says, with a broad smile. \"It will take some years [to rebuild]. But in the end, we will see everyone in Syria.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Syria's interim President, Ahmed Al Sharaa, is a former leader of Al Qaeda who has worked to reinvent his image\n\nA short drive away, we get a very different view from a Syrian family of four - father, mother and two teenage sons. The father - who does not want to be named - runs an aid organisation helping his fellow countrymen. Over glasses of tea and helpings of baklava, I ask if he and his family would move back. His response is swift and adamant. \"No, not for me and for my family,\" he says. \"And the same goes for my organisation. We have projects inside Syria, and we hope to extend that activity. But my family and my organisation will stay here in Turkey.\" Asked why, he lists problems with the economy, security, education and the health system. Syria's interim government \"hasn't any experience to deal with the situation\", he tells me. \"Some ask us to give them a chance, but one year has passed and the indications are not good.\" He too has visited the new Syria, and, like Aya, was not reassured. \"The security situation is very bad,\" he says. \"Every day there are killings. Regardless of who the victims are, they have souls.\" His voice softens when he speaks of his 80-year-old father in Damascus, who hasn't seen his grandsons for 12 years, and may never see them again. For now, he and his family can remain in Turkey, but he's already making contingency plans in case government policy changes. \"Plan A is that we will stay here in Turkey,\" he says. \"If we cannot, I'm thinking about plan B, C and even D. I am an engineer, always planning.\" None of those plans involve a return to Syria.\n\nIf going home is hard, staying in Turkey isn't easy either. Syrians have \"temporary protection\" that comes with restrictions. They are not supposed to leave the cities where they are first registered. Work permits are hard to get, and many are in low paid jobs, living on the margins. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who backed the uprising against Assad - has insisted that no Syrian will be driven out, but refugee advocates say there are growing pressures beneath the surface. They point to the ending of free medical care for Syrians from January, and new government regulations which make it more expensive to hire them. \"These new elements cast a shadow over how voluntary returns are,\" says Metin Corabatir, who heads an independent Turkish research centre on asylum and migration, IGAM. And he says presidential and parliamentary elections – due by 2028 – may be another threat for Syrians here. \"Normally President Erdogan is their main protector,\" Mr Corabatir tells me. \"He says they can stay as long as they want. And he repeated this after the regime changed. But if there is an election, and a political gain for the AKP [ruling party] to make, there might be some policy changes.\"\n\nGetty Images More than half a million Syrians have left Turkey since the ousting of Assad", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:05:53 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T06:50:56.249882"}

Any decisions made could have a potentially momentous impact on questions that determine the future of the region. The US has been Israel's strongest military and political backer throughout two years of war in Gaza and many are now looking to the meeting as a test of the leaders' relationship and how aligned they are on key topics. It will be their sixth meeting since Trump's return to office 11 months ago.\n\nAmong the expected points of discussion is the future of relations with Syria's new government, Iranian rearmament, and Hezbollah's role in Lebanon. Perhaps most critically, they will discuss progress of the Gaza ceasefire deal, where Israel's government has taken several positions diverging from those of the US government.\n\nThe talks will take place as storms continue to lash Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians remain living in basic tents that offer little protection from the cold and flooding. On Monday, the death of a two-month-old baby due to the severe cold was reported by the Hamas-run health ministry, bringing the total killed by the wintry weather since 10 December to three, while another 17 people have been killed by damaged buildings collapsing in the storms. The UN and numerous aid agencies have accused Israel of not meeting its ceasefire obligations by continuing to restrict full access to basic supplies and equipment. Israel has said it is meeting its obligations in facilitating an increase in aid deliveries. The Trump administration wants to see the ceasefire progress to its second phase in January, whereby a Palestinian technocratic government would be established alongside the deployment of an international security force, Hamas would disarm, Israeli troops would withdraw, and the reconstruction of the devastated territory would begin. Critics have suggested that Netanyahu may instead seek to delay the progress of the ceasefire, saying he does not want to engage seriously with questions of a political future for Palestinians and will instead push for Hamas to fully disarm before Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. Hamas officials have repeatedly said that its full disarmament should take place alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state. The 20-point peace plan promoted by Trump and signed by both Israel and Hamas recognises Palestinian aspirations to a sovereign state, however Netanyahu and his ministers have consistently rejected Palestinian statehood since the ceasefire came into effect in October. Last week, Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country would build settlements in Gaza and would \"never fully withdraw\" from the territory even if Hamas disarms, despite this being a key tenet of the ceasefire deal.\n\nReuters Recent winter weather in Gaza has reportedly caused 20 deaths due to the collapse of damaged buildings or exposure to cold", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:52:16 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:28.384765"}
