At least three people were killed, according to Ukrainian officials, including a four-year-old child, while energy infrastructure was also targeted, leaving several regions without power. Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed. Zelensky said \"people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe\" in the run-up to Christmas, and said the strikes sent \"an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities\" despite ongoing peace talks.\n\nHe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia\". Zelensky had previously warned it was in the Kremlin's \"nature\" to \"carry out massive attacks\" during the festive period. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nLocal authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death. Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added. Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service. An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said. Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit. Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia. Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant. The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.\n\nReuters Emergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capital\n\nWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\". The main focus of Russian attacks in recent days has been the southern port city of Odesa, which comes after Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea. The Russian president made the threat in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on tankers belonging to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", vessels used to move goods including oil which are under Western sanctions.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:11:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:57.119660"}

Germany’s humanitarian budget of €1.05bn (£920m) for 2026 will be less than half of last year’s, with spending refocused on areas deemed a priority to Europe.\n\n“I think we are losing a consensus of solidarity and responsibility which has been established for a while now,” said Ralf Südhoff, director of the Berlin-based Centre for Humanitarian Action.\n\n“Germany this year has started to phase out Latin America, decreased engagement in Asia and say they want to focus now on crises which have an impact on Europe,” he said, noting that while Ukraine was in need of funding because of Russia’s invasion, its location in Europe meant it was saved from the cuts developing countries have experienced.\n\nThe UK also announced earlier this year that it would be cutting aid to fund defence spending. Norway has increased its civilian support to Ukraine by 2.5bn kroner (£185m), to a quarter of its aid budget, but has been accused of making Africa pay for that rise with a 355m kroner cut (£26m).\n\nFrance’s budget for 2026 will also see a €700m cut to aid spending, with a 60% reduction in food aid, while increasing defence spending by €6.7bn.\n\n“It’s a broader geopolitical trend and there’s a misleading belief by European actors that they have to play this game now in the same way as Moscow, Beijing, Washington,” said Südhoff, suggesting aid will be more “transactional” and directed to where donors see direct benefits for themselves. “The reaction now is not to fill the gap or attempt to do so but to follow the [American] cuts.”\n\nAnalysis of Germany’s 2026 aid budget by Venro, a coalition of German NGOs, shows that the country is slashing funding to traditional development and poverty-reduction programmes, with a 20% cut for the World Food Programme and 33% for the Gavi vaccine alliance.\n\nOne of the few elements of the budget not cut is Germany’s partnerships with the private sector in developing countries.\n\nAnita Kattakuzhy, director of policy at Near, a coalition of civil society groups in the global south, said a wider pattern is emerging among donors.\n\n“Budgets are being reshaped under political pressure, and the communities who bear the consequences have no way to shape those decisions,” said Kattakuzhy.\n\n“Cutting funding in this way may meet short-term priorities in donor capitals, but it destabilises the local systems that are keeping crises from getting worse.”\n\nAmong the countries most affected by aid cuts is Mozambique, which has suffered from cyclones and droughts as well as a resurgent conflict in the country’s Cabo Delgado province that has displaced more than 300,000 people since July.\n\nThe country has received only $31m of $222m funding required this year, leading to food distribution happening only every two months and covering 39% of caloric needs, according to the UN.\n\nThe cutting of development funding by Sweden will directly hit programmes used to rehabilitate and provide healthcare and education to people displaced by the insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region, which began in 2017.\n\nAll four of the African countries removed from Sweden’s development funding have seen cuts for HIV/Aids services, as experts warn there will be a reversal of years of progress in fighting the disease.\n\nMozambique, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are among six countries, along with Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia – that could bear the brunt of cuts to health programmes tackling HIV/Aids, according to analysis by the Boston Consultant Group.\n\nIlaria Manunza, country director for Save the Children Mozambique, said aid cuts have already made 2025 very difficult: “Every cut compounds the risk of long-term developmental setbacks, particularly in education and child protection,” said Manunza. “If current trends continue, 2026 will be extremely challenging … there is a real risk that progress made over the past decade could be reversed.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:00:05 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:58.250661"}

The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years. The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending. But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\n\n\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\". \"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added. The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%. It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services. Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply, bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:56:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:32:09.831119"}

On the Epstein investigation, the DOJ's note reads \"the investigation to date has revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation\". The document also underlined that Andrew was not a \"target\" of the investigation and no evidence had been gathered that he had committed any crime under US law.

The 11,000-plus documents continue a stream of released information that began on Friday, the deadline mandated in a new law that required the department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the deceased paedophile and financier. Many of the documents released on Tuesday are redacted with names and information blacked out, including names of people who the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case. The justice department is facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law specifically states can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations. President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated Trump flew on Epstein's jet. The justice department said some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump. Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.\n\nEmail exchange between 'A' and Ghislaine Maxwell about 'girls'\n\nOf the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" stands out. The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\". \"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\" The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\". An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\". Email by 'A' from 'Balmoral' asked Ghislaine Maxwell for 'inappropriate friends', Epstein files show\n\nWho and what are in the Epstein files?\n\nWhat the underwhelming Epstein files release means for Trump and Maga Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru. In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\". The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response.\n\nFBI email lists out 10 alleged co-conspirators to Epstein\n\nUS Department of Justice\n\nAmong the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein. The emails said six of the 10 co-conspirators had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut. Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\". Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file. Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner. An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\". The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier. Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\". \"Mr. Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said. Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DOJ. \"There's 10 co-conspirators potentially that we knew nothing about that the DOJ had been investigating,\" Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency. The law passed by Congress and signed by President Trump states names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted and specifically asks the justice department for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions concerning \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".\n\nJustice Department says Epstein letter to Larry Nassar is a fake\n\nGetty Images Larry Nassar\n\nA letter included in the released batch of documents got a lot of attention online. But, according to the justice department, it is fake. The handwritten letter and envelope at first appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes. \"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the faux letter states. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\" The writer signs it, \"Life is unfair, Yours, J. Epstein.\" The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent back to a Manhattan jail where Epstein was detained before his death. The FBI was alerted to the returned letter and requested an analysis of it. That request was also included in the releases batch of documents. The justice department on Tuesday called the letter a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it. \"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X. \"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" they added. Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died. Even before the justice department's announcement of it being fake, the documents raised immediate questions. The return sender was listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was \"Metropolitan Correctional Center\". The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI. A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison. Nassar is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nTrump's travels aboard Epstein's private jet\n\nGetty Images\n\nTrump's name appears more in these files than in other batches of documents released by the justice department. Notably, in a January 2020 email, a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\". The recipient of the email was redacted. Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\". Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999. The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted. Trump travelled on Epstein's plane more than previously thought, prosecutor says\n\nImage in Epstein files that features Trump reinstated after backlash\n\nClinton and Trump - Two US presidents and their long associations with Jeffrey Epstein \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\" The timing of the trips coincide with years in which federal prosecutors were examining Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. She was ultimately found guilty of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse minors. But throughout the files released on Tuesday, many of the other mentions of Trump's name are simply in press clippings mentioning him, his campaigns, and other news moments. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in regards to Epstein. In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the Department of Justice said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\". \"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,\" the justice department said.\n\nFake video of Epstein included", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:08:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T02:10:57.679496"}

The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community. The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.\"\n\n\"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,\" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday. Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament. Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country. It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month. Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute. Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition.\n\nBeatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states. In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\". The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:11:10 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T22:26:08.958858"}

She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety.\n\nIn a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes.\n\nThe Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCombs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters.\n\nDuring a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.\n\nThe jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. That bid was not successful.\n\nAhead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years.\n\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\".\n\nCombs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison.\n\nIt argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\".\n\nBefore Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\"\n\n\"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\"\n\nCombs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation.

More than 1 million people have been displaced, many of them two, three or even four times.\n\nNeither the Mozambican army nor a Rwandan intervention have managed to quell the insurgency, which has ravaged northern Mozambique since October 2017, when militants from Islamic State-Mozambique, an affiliate of the main IS group in the Middle East, carried out their first attacks, in Mocímboa da Praia in Cabo Delgado province in the north-east.\n\nThe group drew global attention in March 2021 with an attack on the town of Palma. More than 600 people were killed in the assault and the military’s subsequent recapturing of the town, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a non-profit conflict monitor, including foreign workers on a multibillion-dollar Total liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.\n\nRwanda, whose military is better equipped and trained than Mozambique’s, deployed 1,000 troops to Cabo Delgado in July 2021, initially pushing back the militants.

After eight years … there are no effective initiatives of dialogue.”\n\nHe said much of the military effort was focused on securing the estimated $20bn LNG project, which Total said in October it would resume once it received government approval.\n\nNhamirre said: “First you need to ask what [objective] the Rwandan and Mozambican forces had. If it is to guarantee human security, then we can say that they have failed … But if the objective is to secure the LNG project, then they have achieved some success … The LNG project is definitely more secure than in 2021.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Displaced survivors of an attack by IS-linked militants arriving at Pemba port, Mozambique, in April 2021.

In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that there had been sharp increase in such kidnappings.\n\nSheila Nhancale, a researcher for HRW, said: “The displacement that is happening now is also increasing the risk of sexual violence, exploitation and abuse, particularly for women and children. Of the 100,000 displaced [in November], 70,000 are children.”\n\nPeople forced to flee are also facing shrinking support. Donors have given $195m to the humanitarian response this year – only 55% of the estimated need – compared with $246m last year, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nSebastián Traficante, the head of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières in Mozambique, said displaced people “have to stay in places with very poor conditions, with very poor access to basic services … that are already affected by eight years of conflict.\n\n“They just want this to end.

Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, especially among the religious right in America, and it has often been framed as religious persecution.\n\nHowever, Nigeria’s government rejects framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution, saying in the past that armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and US claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But the government has previously agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups.\n\nMany analysts say the situation is complex and has long roots in the region’s history. In some parts of the country, clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water.\n\nPriests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom, but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.\n\nTrump, who positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in 2024, campaigned on the promise of extraditing the US from decades of “endless wars”.

Triggered by a rare cyclone in November, the deluge killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the island of Sumatra. In Aceh, the worst-hit province which accounted for nearly half of the deaths, many still do not have ready access to clean water, food, electricity and medical supplies. In a sign of just how frustrating managing the crisis has become, the governor of North Aceh broke down publicly earlier this month. \"Does the central government not know [what we're experiencing]? I don't understand,\" a tearful Ismail A Jalil said in front of cameras. But President Prabowo Subianto has refused foreign aid, insisting the situation is \"under control\". \"Indonesia is capable of overcoming this disaster,\" he told his cabinet last week. Prabowo has also so far ignored calls to declare it a national disaster, which would unlock emergency funds and streamline relief efforts.\n\nPrabowo's administration has increasingly been criticised as reactive, disorganised and out of touch – adjectives that some analysts say have come to define his presidency, which he won in February 2024 on the back of populist pledges. Already this year, his flagship billion-dollar free school meals programme has been mired in controversy over mass food poisonings. In August and September, thousands of Indonesians took to the streets over unemployment and rising costs of living, in what were some of the biggest protests the country has seen in decades. And now his government's response to November's floods has become yet another challenge for the leader, even as his approval ratings have held steady at about 78%.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Many in Aceh still do not have ready access to clean water, food and electricity\n\nDesperate calls for help\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of protesters rallied in Aceh's capital, Banda Aceh, waving white flags and demanding that the central government opens the door to foreign aid. Standing among the crowd was a little girl holding a sheet of paper, which read: \"I am just three years old, I want to grow up in a safe and sustainable world.\" Though typically seen as a symbol for surrender, the white flags that have popped up across the province – on broken rooftops, along eroded riverbanks and outside mosques – are a call for international solidarity, protesters say. \"The flags do not mean we are giving in. They are a distress signal to grab the attention of friends outside, to let them know the conditions in Aceh today are very bad,\" Husnul Khawatinnissa, who was at the rally, tells the BBC. Entire villages have been wiped out, while widespread damage to roads and infrastructure has also isolated many communities. Survivors have spoken of sickness and starvation. \"How long more do we have to wash ourselves in mud and floodwaters,\" shouted Nurmi Ali, another demonstrator. Provincial authorities have reached out to the United Nations for support, with the Aceh governor declaring he welcomes help \"from anyone, anywhere\". Prabowo's administration has said relief efforts are under way on a \"national scale\", noting that it has disbursed some 60 trillion rupiah ($3.6bn) for reconstruction efforts.\n\nDisaster strikes again\n\nFor some in Aceh, the situation brings back painful memories of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the worst natural disasters ever. A magnitude 9.1 undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that triggered waves up to 30m (100 feet) high which slammed into the Indian Ocean coastline that morning, killing an estimated 230,000 people in more than a dozen countries. Aceh, already ravaged by decades of civil war, was among the hardest-hit. Locals say they had only recently finished rebuilding their lives when disaster struck again in November. Relief arrived more quickly after the 2004 tsunami, even though it was far more devastating, they say. Various countries, multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and private organisations poured billions of dollars into the recovery effort. The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects. \"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck. The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added. Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods – but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.\n\nGetty Images Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:09:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T05:01:10.478342"}

Zelensky said he expected the meeting to take place on Sunday and to focus on a US-brokered 20-point peace plan, as well as separate proposals for US security guarantees. Meanwhile, the Kremlin says President Vladimir Putin's senior aide has held further talks with US officials over the phone, and that Russia has committed to continuing with the negotiations. Russia has spoken of \"slow but steady progress\" in talks but has not commented on Zelensky's offer to withdraw troops from the eastern Donbas, if Russia pulls back too.\n\nUkraine has sought to secure guarantees from the US as part of a deal, and Zelensky has suggested that a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" is a potential option for areas of Donbas that Russia has failed to take by force. On Friday, Zelensky said he had received an update on the latest technical talks from his most senior negotiator, Rustem Umerov. He wrote on social media: \"We are not losing a single day. We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year.\" A White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump in February, the first after the US president returned to office, descended into a hostile shouting match, though their most recent meeting at the White House in October was far more amicable.\n\nReuters Ukrainian soldiers were pictured eating a Christmas meal together as fighting continued along the front line\n\nConfirmation of planned top-level talks came after the Ukrainian leader said he had spoken to Trump's chief negotiators, special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, for an hour over the phone on Christmas Day. He said the latest round of negotiations had generated \"new ideas\" on how to end the war, and described it as a \"really good conversation\". The White House has proposed establishing what would in effect be a demilitarised zone in eastern Ukraine where both sides agree not to deploy troops - a compromise that would avoid settling the intractable question of legal ownership over the contested territory. Zelensky signalled on Wednesday that if Ukraine were to pull back by up to 40km (25 miles) from the front line in the east to create an economic zone, then Russia would have to do the same from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's industrial heartland in the Donbas. Ukraine has secured a number of changes to an earlier 28-point draft plan, which was formulated by Steve Witkoff but widely seen as being favourable to Russia. Zelensky told reporters on Friday that the weekend talks in Florida would focus on several documents, including US security guarantees and a separate economic agreement. However, Zelensky has repeatedly said the question of territory has proved to be the most difficult issue to resolve, along with the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The White House has proposed Ukraine and Russia split the energy generated by the plant, the largest in Europe.

The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law.\n\nOn Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.\n\nBut the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.\n\nOn Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.\n\nThe 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.\n\nInvestigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.\n\nNajib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who has maintained his innocence but remains at large.\n\nBut the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib guilty of embezzlement in 2020.\n\nThat year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.\n\nHe was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term halved last year.\n\nThe latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013. Najib said he had believed the money was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah - a claim rejected by the judge on Friday.\n\nSeparately Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, was sentenced to ten years in jail in 2022 for bribery. She is free on bail pending an appeal against her conviction.\n\nThe scandal has had profound repercussions on Malaysian politics.

The [Pentagon] is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come …\n\n“Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation. Merry Christmas!”\n\nNigeria’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said on Friday that the US strikes, which came after Trump had accused Nigeria’s government of failing to stop Christians being killed in the country, were “part of joint ongoing operations”.\n\nNigeria is officially secular and its population is almost evenly split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn attention from the religious right in the US, which has framed it as persecution. Nigeria’s government has pointed out that armed groups target Christians and Muslims.\n\nNigeria provided the intelligence for the airstrikes in Sokoto state, Tuggar told the country’s Channels Television on Friday. He said he had spoken to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for 19 minutes, then called the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, to get his go-ahead, before speaking to Rubio again for another five minutes.\n\n“We have been working closely with the Americans,” Tuggar said. “This is what we’ve always been hoping for, to work with the Americans, to work with other countries, to combat terrorism, to stop the death of innocent Nigerians … It’s a collaborative effort.”\n\nThe US military’s Africa Command (Africom) said the strikes in Sokoto state had been carried out in coordination with Nigerian authorities. An earlier Africom statement posted on X and then removed said they had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities.\n\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\n\n“I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”\n\nNeither the US nor the Nigerian authorities have said if anyone was killed in the airstrikes. Asked if there would be more, Tuggar said: “You can call it a new phase of an old conflict. For us it is something that is ongoing.”\n\nUS planes conducted surveillance missions over the region earlier this month. It is believed they were using an airport in neighbouring Ghana as a base.\n\nForests in Sokoto, which is bordered by Niger to the north, have been used as bases by gangs of armed bandits and members of Islamic State – Sahel Province (ISSP) , known locally as Lakurawa. Some analysts say the IS branch started when a group of herders joined together to fight bandits in the absence of state support. The state is mostly Muslim.\n\nClashes between Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of Nigeria have been aggravated by ethnicity and religion, but their roots lie in competition for land and water.\n\nPriests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.\n\nTuggar said the operation was about “protecting Nigerians and innocent lives”, not one religion or another. “The president emphasised yesterday, before he gave it the go-ahead, that it must be made clear that … it is a joint operation,” he said. “It is not targeting any religion, nor is it simply in the name of one religion or another.”\n\nA day before the Sokoto strikes, a Christmas Eve suicide bombing at a mosque in north-east Nigeria killed at least five people and left more than 30 seriously injured. The Nigerian army attributed the attack to the jihadist group Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in the region for almost two decades, mostly separate to the violence in the north-west.\n\nThere have been almost 6,000 incidents of violence in Nigeria in 2025, about half of them attacks targeting civilians, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (Acled), a non-profit conflict monitor. The state of Katsina, another Muslim-majority state two states to the east of Sokoto, had the highest number of incidents at 706. Sokoto had the fourth highest, 353.\n\nTrump positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in the 2024 US presidential election, campaigning on a promise of extricating Washington from decades of “endless wars”.\n\nHowever, the first year of his second term in the White House has been notable for a number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on countries including Yemen, Iran and Syria, as well as a huge military buildup in the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:41:45 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T15:27:37.920127"}

Somaliland controls the north-west tip of Somalia, where it operates a de facto state, and is bordered by Djibouti to the north and Ethiopia to the west and south.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office said the declaration was “in the spirit” of the Abraham accords, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and mostly Arab states signed in 2020.\n\nIt posted a video of Benjamin Netanyahu speaking via video call with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, in which he invited him to visit Israel and described the friendship between the two countries as “historic”. Abdullahi said he would be “glad to be in Jerusalem as soon as possible”.\n\nSa’ar said the recognition came after a year of dialogue between the two countries and that he had instructed Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs to immediately “institutionalise ties between the two countries”.\n\nIsraeli analysts have said that recognition of the breakaway state could be in Israel’s strategic interest, given Somaliland’s proximity to Yemen, where Israel has conducted extensive airstrikes against the Houthi rebels over the past two years.\n\nA report in November by the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli thinktank, said: “Somaliland’s territory could serve as a forward base for multiple missions: intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and their armament efforts; logistical support for Yemen’s legitimate government in its war against them; and a platform for direct operations against the Houthis.”\n\nThe Somaliland authorities already host a military base operated by the United Arab Emirates in Berbera, which has a military port and an airstrip for fighter jets and transport aircraft. Analysts have suggested that the base is a key part of the UAE’s anti-Houthi campaign in Yemen.\n\nSomaliland’s president revealed in May that US military officials, including the most senior officer in the Horn of Africa, had visited Somaliland and that another US delegation was expected to visit soon. “It’s a matter of time. Not if, but when and who will lead the recognition of Somaliland,” Abdullahi told the Guardian.\n\nProject 2025, which was published in 2023 and is alleged to have guided much of the doctrine of Donald Trump’s second administration, called for the recognition of Somaliland as a “hedge against the US’s deteriorating position in Djibouti”, where Chinese influence is growing.\n\nThis August, the Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz wrote to Trump asking him to recognise Somaliland. Cruz said Somaliland was an ally of Israel and that it had expressed support for the Abraham accords.\n\nThe US administration is reportedly split over the recognition of Somaliland, with some fearing such a move could endanger military cooperation with Somalia. The US has troops deployed there, where it supports Somali forces in their fight against the Islamist movement al-Shabaab.\n\nSomaliland has a population of a little more than 6.2 million. The breakaway state has a democratic system that has had peaceful transfers of power, though the Washington-based non-profit organisation Freedom House noted an “erosion of political rights and civic space” in recent years, with journalists and opposition figures facing repression from authorities.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:34:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:43:13.946860"}

He had been detained in jail two years beyond his five-year sentence as the Cairo authorities refused to recognise the period he held in pre-trial detention as part of his time served.\n\nA previous attempt by Abd el-Fattah to leave Cairo for London in November after his release from jail, was blocked by the security forces a month ago. He has since been trying to negotiate an agreement whereby he is allowed to travel freely between Cairo and London and not be permanently excluded from Egypt if he came to the UK.\n\nHis arrival in London was announced by his mother, Laila Soueif, on Facebook.\n\nHis sister Mona Seif said: “I can’t believe it’s finally happened and Alaa has made it to London. We thought it was impossible, but here he is. Hundreds of people around the world did so much to help bring this moment about. Alaa is free and we can finally begin to heal as a family.”\n\nThe family believe the agreement will allow him to travel back and forth between the UK and Egypt.\n\nJames Lynch of FairSquare, a human rights organisation that has worked alongside Abd el-Fattah’s family for several years, said: “I’m delighted that Alaa has safely returned to the UK to be reunited with his son after such a lengthy ordeal lasting well over a decade. After everything Alaa and his family have been through, I’m hopeful this marks the beginning of a new chapter for them.”\n\n0:57 Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah reunited with family after release from prison – video\n\nHis mother twice came close to death when she was admitted to hospital during an extended eight-month hunger strike designed to put pressure on the UK Foreign Office to do more to secure his release.\n\nThe British prime minister, Keir Starmer, made three calls to his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end his detention. But the Egyptians never allowed British consular visits to jail, saying they did not recognise his dual citizenship status.\n\nChanges in the Egyptian embassy in London may have helped produce a less inflexible stance.\n\nAbd el-Fattah, from a family of human rights activists, became a leading voice during the Arab spring. He has a direct, perceptive, non-sectarian writing style that has won him awards.\n\nHe has a teenage son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton and attends a special educational needs school. The boy visited him in Cairo soon after his release, in what was regarded as a successful reunion.\n\nAbd el-Fattah’s sister, Sana, explained at the time he had been blocked from flying out of Cairo: “We’re really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly.”\n\n“Khaled needs his father. My nephew … is very, very comfortable in his school and his setup in Brighton. We can’t change. We can’t keep creating instability.”\n\nHe had already served a five-year jail sentence passed in September 2019 on charges of “spreading false news” after a much-criticised trial, yet last year his family were told he would not be released until January 2027.\n\nStarmer made no criticism of the justice of Abd el-Fattah’s sentencing. “I’m delighted that Alaa is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief,” the prime minister wrote on social media. “I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment.\n\n“Alaa’s case has been a top priority for my government since we came to office.

Death to all Islamic terrorists! Thank you.”\n\nLoomer said she had been informed by the US defense department – which the Trump administration calls the war department – that the American cruise missile strikes carried out with the Nigerian government’s cooperation had been “a direct response to [IS] jihadi terrorists killing Christians in Nigeria”.\n\nThe US House member Randy Fine, a Florida Republican who in November supported a congressional resolution calling for Nigeria to be designated a “country of particular concern” due to its religious violence, described Thursday’s strikes as an “amazing Christmas present!”\n\n“With Muslim terrorists attacking Christians in Nigeria, Syria, and even Europe – simply for refusing to submit to Islam – the president is showing that we will no longer tolerate these barbarians,” Fine said on X, after suggesting earlier in December that “mainstream Muslims” should be “destroyed”.\n\nThe uniformity of the Republicans’ response comes in contrast to a campaign involving economic pressure as well as airstrikes on alleged drug boats that the Trump administration is waging on Venezuela to oust its president, Nicolás Maduro. Some Republicans have warned that the history of US “regime change” efforts are not promising and have warned against direct military strikes on Venezuela.\n\nAttacks on Christians by Islamic extremist groups in Nigeria such as Boko Haram had been drawing increased attention from US Christian groups that are generally aligned with Trump.\n\n“Do not test President Trump‘s resolved [sic] in this matter,” said a post from the Republican US House member Riley Moore of West Virginia, who introduced the Nigeria-related congressional resolution in November. “Tonight’s strike in coordination with the Nigerian government is just the first step to ending the slaughter of Christians and the security crisis affecting all Nigerians.”\n\nIn further comments on Friday, other Republican lawmakers praised Trump for carrying out the strikes. North Carolina senator Ted Budd, a Republican, said that IS “is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Christians & religious minorities in Nigeria”.\n\nBudd wrote that Trump’s “decisive strikes will save lives & protect religious freedom. May God bless our brave men & women in uniform.”\n\nCongressman Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who recently led a delegation to Nigeria, said that attitudes within the Nigerian government were “beginning to turn in favor of protecting Christians – in addition to taking actions against those terrorizing Christians and moderate Muslims”.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said on X that he commended the Trump administration as well as American troops for “these strikes against bloodthirsty [IS] savages who are not only persecuting Christians, but also have killed many Americans”.\n\nPressure on the administration to act in Nigeria had been building since July, when the US Commission on International Religious Freedom issued an advisory that said the Nigerian government was “often unable to prevent or slow to react to violent attacks by Fulani herders, bandit gangs, and insurgent entities such as JAS/Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)”.\n\nIn October, Ted Cruz – a Republican senator from Texas – said the US was able to identify the perpetrators of anti-Christian violence in Nigeria “and I intend to hold them accountable”. Cruz said that since 2009, “over 50,000 Christians in Nigeria have been massacred, and over 18,000 churches and 2,000 Christian schools have been destroyed”.\n\nAt the recent AmericaFest, a four-day gathering of US conservative organized by Turning Point USA, the Trinidadian rap star Nicki Minaj spoke with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, on the oppression of Christians in Nigeria. She said she loved Nigeria in part because her pastor is Nigerian.\n\n“Hearing that people are being kidnapped – while they’re in church, people are being kidnapped, people are being killed, brutalized, all because of their religion – that should spark outrage in America, and that’s what it’s doing,” Minaj said.\n\nThursday’s strikes in Nigeria come less than a week after the US hit more than 70 Islamic State networks and infrastructure in Syria in response to an attack that killed two American military service members as well as a civilian.\n\nAdm Brad Cooper, commander of the American military’s Central Command (Centcom), said the Syrian strikes were “critical to preventing [IS] from inspiring terrorist plots and attacks against the US homeland”.\n\nHegseth on Friday warned of additional US strikes against IS targets in northern Nigeria.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:50:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T18:37:41.632250"}

Both sides have agreed to freeze all troop movements and allow civilians living in border areas to return home, halting weeks of intense border clashes that have killed at least 41 people and displaced almost a million people. The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT). Once it has held for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand will also be released, the statement said. The breakthrough came after Thai and Cambodian officials held several days of talks aimed at ending fresh fighting between the two countries.\n\nThe joint statement outlines the terms of \"de-escalation\", which includes ceasing \"attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side\". \"Both sides must avoid unprovoked firing or advancement or movement of troops towards the other side's positions or troops,\" the statement said. The statement also said that the release of the 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand would be conducted \"in the spirit of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration\", an agreement between the two countries signed at a ceremony attended by US President Donald Trump in October. That ceasefire agreement was broken earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides have since blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce. The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani Province, and a Thai solider had been killed. Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate. Clashes have continued throughout December.

He is the candidate for the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), backed by Myanmar's military, in Aungmyaythazan, a constituency in the city of Mandalay. The crowd of 300-400 clutch the branded hats and flags they've been given, but soon wilt in the afternoon heat, some dozing off. Children run and play in between the rows of chairs. Many of these families are victims of the earthquake which badly damaged Mandalay and surrounding areas in March, and are hoping for a handout. They disappear the moment the rally finishes.\n\nA 'sham' election\n\nOn Sunday the people of Myanmar get their first opportunity to vote in an election since the military seized power in a coup nearly five years ago, setting off a devastating civil war. But the poll, already delayed many times by the ruling junta, is being widely condemned as a sham. The most popular party, the National League for Democracy, has been dissolved, and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is locked up in an undisclosed prison. Voting, which will happen in three stages over a period of a month, will not even be possible in large parts of the country still consumed by war. Even where voting is taking place, it is marred by a climate of fear and intimidation.\n\nWhen the BBC tried asking people at the rally in Mandalay what they thought of the election, we were told not to by party officials. They might say the wrong thing, one man explained – they don't know how to speak to journalists. The number of plain-clothes military intelligence officers present there helps explain their nervousness. In a dictatorship which has criminalised liking Facebook pages criticising the election, or using the word revolution, even these staunchly pro-military party activists feared the consequences of allowing a foreign journalist the chance to ask uncensored questions. The same fear lingers on the streets of Mandalay. At a market stall selling fresh river fish the customers all refused to answer what they thought of the election. We have no choice, so we have to vote, one said. The fish seller shooed us away. \"You will bring me trouble,\" she said. Only one woman was brave enough to speak frankly, but we needed to find a private place to meet, and to conceal her identity, just to hear her view of the election. \"This election is a lie,\" she said. \"Everyone is afraid. Everyone has lost their humanity and their freedom. So many people have died, been tortured or fled to other countries. If the military keeps running the country, how can things change?\" She would not vote, she said, but she knew that decision carried risks.\n\nLulu Luo/ BBC Most people we encountered did not want to discuss the election\n\nThe military authorities imposed a new law in July criminalising \"any speech, organising, inciting, protesting, or distributing leaflets in order to destroy a part of the electoral process\". Earlier this month Tayzar San, a doctor and one of the first to organise a protest against the 2021 coup, was also among the first to be charged under the law, after he distributed leaflets calling for a boycott of the election. The junta has offered a reward for information leading to his arrest. In September three young people in Yangon were given sentences of 42 to 49 years each for posting stickers showing a bullet and a ballot box together.\n\nTayzar San/Facebook Tayzar San distributing leaflets boycotting the election\n\n\"Co-operate and crush all those harming the union,\" commands a large red poster looming over the families and couples enjoying a late afternoon stroll under the old red-brick walls of the royal palace in Mandalay. In this menacing climate anything approaching a free vote is unimaginable.\n\nA general's gambit\n\nYet the junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has a spring in his step these days. He seems confident this extraordinary election, where there will be no voting at all in as much as one half of the country, will give him the legitimacy he has failed to acquire during his five catastrophic years in power. He even attended a Christmas mass in Yangon's cathedral and condemned the \"hatred and resentment between individuals\" which led to \"domination, oppression, and violence in human communities\". This, from a man charged by the UN and human rights groups with genocide against Muslim Rohingyas, whose coup set off a civil war which, according to the data analysis group ACLED, has killed 90,000 people.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing\n\nMin Aung Hlaing's election gambit has the full diplomatic support of China, which, bizarrely for a one-party state, is giving technical and financial support for this multi-party exercise. It is likely to be reluctantly accepted in the rest of Asia too. His army, newly equipped with Chinese and Russian weapons, has been regaining ground lost over the past two years to the various armed groups opposing the coup. He is clearly hoping to include more reconquered territory in the third stage of the election at the end of January. With Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD out of the picture his USDP is all but guaranteed to win. In the last, free election in 2020, the USDP won only six percent of parliamentary seats. Some observers have noted that Min Aung Hlaing is not popular even within his own regime, or his own party, where his leadership qualities are questioned. He will probably keep the presidency after the election, but his power will, to some extent, be diluted by the resumption of parliamentary politics, albeit without most of the parties that won seats in the 2020 election. The election is clearly viewed by China as an off-ramp, a way for the military to get out of the destructive deadlock caused by its ill-judged coup.\n\n'No-one is ready to compromise'\n\nEven a short distance from the apparently peaceful city life of Mandalay, the deep scars left by Myanmar's civil war, which is still far from over, are visible. On the opposite side of the Irrawaddy River lies the spectacular temple complex at Mingun, once a popular tourist attraction. Getting there requires a short drive along a riverside road, but for the past four years this, like much of the area around Mandalay, has been contested territory, where volunteer People's Defence Forces control many villages and launch ambushes against army convoys. To reach Mingun we needed to get through several checkpoints. We sat in a tea shop with the local police commander to negotiate our passage. He was a young man, wearing the huge strain of his job on his face. He had a revolver stuck in the back of his trousers, and two even younger men – boys, perhaps - carrying military-issue assault rifles sat close by as his bodyguards.\n\nLulu Luo/ BBC Many young men have taken up arms on both sides of this conflict\n\nHe said he had to carry these weapons just to move about the village. On his phone were images of his opponents: young men, raggedly dressed, with an assortment of weapons they may have smuggled from border regions of Myanmar or obtained from dead soldiers and police officers. One group, calling itself the Unicorn Guerrilla Force, was his toughest adversary. They never negotiated, he said. \"If we see each other we always shoot. That's the way it is.\" The election, he added, would not be taking place in most of the villages to the north of him. \"Everyone here has taken sides in this conflict. It is so complicated and difficult. But no-one is ready to compromise.\" After an hour we were told it would be too dangerous to reach Mingun.

His actions triggered widespread protests and criticism from opposition groups and civil society, most of whom doubted his vow not to personally run for office.\n\nOn Sunday, 6.7 million eligible voters in Guinea will head to the ballot box for the first presidential election since the 2021 coup. Among the nine candidates are the former minister Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea and the former junta supporter turned critic Faya Millimono of the Liberal Bloc party.\n\nBut thanks to a controversial referendum in September that led to the adoption of a new constitution allowing him to run and extending presidential terms from five to seven years, the clear frontrunner is Doumbouya.\n\nThe opposition coalition Forces vives de Guinée has called his candidacy a betrayal. “The man who presented himself as the restorer of democracy chose to become its gravedigger,” it said in a statement last month after Doumbouya officially deposited his intent to run with the supreme court.\n\nPolitical upheavals have been a recurring feature in west Africa, a region that has earned the moniker of “coup belt” after seven successful coups and several unsuccessful attempts since 2020. While Guinea has remained under the Ecowas umbrella, fellow juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, angered by its post-coup sanctions, have split from the regional bloc to form the pro-Russian Alliance of Sahel States (AES). If it holds, the Guinean election will be the first in any of the junta-run states since 2020.\n\nView image in fullscreen A campaign billboard in Conakry of the Guinean presidential candidate Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea. Photograph: Souleymane Camara/Reuters\n\nWithin Guinea, many believe the general’s victory is a foregone conclusion, given his consolidation of power since ascending to the presidency and promoting himself to a general. Even now, the presidential race is notable not for those who are on the ballot, but for those who are not.\n\nThe biggest opposition parties remain suspended, and their most prominent leaders have been detained, barred from running or – like the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, are in exile. Many say a climate of fear pervades the country due to the junta’s crackdown against its critics, with several dissidents in jail.\n\nConversely, Doumbouya pardoned the former dictator Moussa Dadis Camara who was given a 20-year sentence for his role in one of Guinea’s most serious human rights atrocities: the 2009 massacre and mass rape of protesters at a stadium in Conakry. The pardon, granted before the final hearing, prompted several human rights groups to write a joint open letter to the junta leader alongside families of victims, urging him to reconsider. That process is now in limbo.\n\nAhead of the vote, Doumbouya has been accumulating goodwill.This month, the shiny new Simandou mine, which has the world’s largest untapped reserve of iron ore, was launched after nearly three decades of delays caused by political instability and corruption. Doumbouya’s government is touting the project as a bridge to prosperity for Guinea and a sign of incoming development, despite mass job losses and environmental complaints.\n\nThe election stakes are high: in the coming years, the multi-layered Simandou mine project – which also includes the construction of ports and a railway – is expected to transform the economy of Guinea, where half of the population lives on below $2 a day. Given existential concerns around transparency, many are waiting to see what the winning government does after the election.\n\n“Our salvation lies in a return to the [proper] constitutional order,” said Abdoulaye Koroma, a presidential candidate for the Rally for Renaissance and Development party.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 08:00:33 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T08:34:44.488389"}

Dologuélé was the runner-up in the last two elections – 2015 and 2020 – while Dondra briefly served under the president.\n\nThe opposition hopes to tap into the frustrations of people living in a country where conflict is a daily reality. More than half a million people remain internally displaced within CAR, with a similar number living as refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, Touadéra, a former mathematics professor who has been in power since 2016, is widely expected to extend his run in office.\n\nHe went from an academic to a statesman after the then-president, François Bozizé, appointed him prime minister in 2008. Touadéra stayed in that role until 2013, when the administration was toppled by a rebel coalition, as sectarian violence triggered a civil war.\n\nAfter a chaotic three-year transition, Touadéra ran for office, and the perception that he was neutral, independent of the ex-Séléka and anti-Balaka militias, powered his second-round victory.\n\nA peace accord was signed in April with the two main rebel groups, and there is hope the country might be slowly stabilising. There had been “tangible progress to establish peace”, said Lewis Mudge, the central Africa director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAbdou Abarry, the head of the UN regional 0ffice for central Africa (Unoca) agreed, although added there were still challenges. “This is an opportunity to commend the remarkable recovery of the country, which is laying the foundations for peace consolidation among domestic actors and has undertaken measures to secure its borders, notably with Chad and Cameroon,” he told the UN security council this month.\n\nStill, there are concerns that supply-chain issues and violence could disrupt the vote, especially in some rural areas. The UN peacekeeping mission Minusca, whose mandate was recently renewed until next year, is providing the security and logistical support the state’s crumbling infrastructure cannot manage.\n\nThere are claims the voter list was only published online, and not physically, even though most people have no internet access or electricity. The electoral issues have led to a band of opposition politicians announcing a boycott.\n\nAccording to Mudge, the irregularities could “disenfranchise large segments of the population” and undercut the integrity of the process.\n\nMany people worry that another Touadéra term – a 2023 constitutional referendum not only scrapped term limits but extended presidential mandates from five to seven years – would mean more free roaming for outside interests.\n\nAfter taking office, Touadéra put faith in the Russian mercenary firm Wagner, which provides part of his private security, while Minusca and Rwandan troops helped secure the countryside. Since its arrival in 2018, Wagner’s influence within CAR has grown such that despite the founder Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death, Touadéra has resisted Moscow’s calls to integrate the military contractors within Africa Corps, its successor entity.\n\nRwanda, where the government often mentions the need for “African solutions to African problems”, has taken a different approach from Russia, focusing on smaller business interests in CAR.\n\nIn August, a pro-opposition media outlet claimed the government had evicted its own soldiers from a World Bank-funded youth training centre in Nzila, a village on the outskirts of the capital, Bangui, to clear the way for Rwandan troops to engage in a large livestock farming operation.\n\n“Touadéra is determined to sell off the country piece by piece and sacrifice the youth of the Central African Republic,” the editorial read.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T05:30:45.412106"}

The military government is holding a phased ballot nearly five years after it seized power in a coup, which sparked widespread opposition and spiralled into a civil war. Observers say the junta, with China's support, is seeking to legitimise and entrench its power as it seeks a way out of the devastating stalemate. More than 200 people have been charged for disrupting or opposing the polls under a new law which carries severe punishments, including the death penalty.\n\nPolling began on Sunday after reports of explosions in at least two regions of Myanmar. Three people were taken to hospital following a rocket attack on an uninhabited house in the Mandalay region in the early hours of Sunday, the chief minister of the region confirmed to the BBC. One of those people is in a serious condition. Separately, more than ten houses were damaged in the Myawaddy township, near the border with Thailand, following a series of explosions late on Saturday. A local resident told the BBC that a child was killed in the attack, and three people were taken to hospital in an emergency condition. Voters have told the BBC that the election feels more \"disciplined and systematic\" than those previously. \"The experience of voting has changed a lot,\" said Ma Su ZarChi, who lives in the Mandalay region. \"Before I voted, I was afraid. Now that I have voted, I feel relieved. I cast my ballot as someone who has tried their best for the country.\" First-time voter Ei Pyay Phyo Maung, 22, told the BBC she was casting her ballot because she believed that voting is \"the responsibility of every citizen\". \"My hope is for the lower classes - right now, the prices of goods are skyrocketing, and I want to support someone who can bring them down for those struggling the most,\" she said. \"I want a president who provides equally for all people.\"\n\nThe Burmese junta has rejected criticism of the polls, maintaining that it aims to \"return [the country] to a multi-party democratic system\". After casting his vote at a highly fortified polling station in the capital, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing told the BBC that the election would be free and fair. \"I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, a civil servant. I can't just say that I want to be president,\" he said, stressing that there are three phases of the election. Earlier this week, he warned that those who refuse to vote are rejecting \"progress toward democracy\".\n\nWin Kyaw Thu/BBC Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing cast his ballot in the capital Nay Pyi Taw\n\nFilm director Mike Tee, actor Kyaw Win Htut and comedian Ohn Daing were among the prominent figures convicted under the law against disrupting polls, which was enacted in July.

Civilians are \"being coerced from all sides\", Mr Türk said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that armed rebel groups have issued their own threats asking people to boycott the polls. The military has been fighting on several fronts, against both armed resistance groups who oppose the coup, as well as ethnic armies which have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year following relentless airstrikes enabled by support from China and Russia.

On screen, she was a French cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality. One publication called her \"the princess of pout and the countess of come hither\", but it was an image she grew to loathe. Ruthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress. Eventually, she abandoned her career to campaign for animal welfare. Years later, her reputation was damaged when she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred. Her son also sued her for emotional damage after she said she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\". It was a scar on the memory of an icon, who - in her prime - put the bikini, female desire, and French cinema on the map.\n\nLido/Shutterstock Bardot helped to make the bikini socially acceptable in the 1950s\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris on 28 September 1934. She and her sister, Marie-Jeanne, grew up in a luxurious apartment in the plushest district of the city. Her Catholic parents were wealthy and pious, and demanded high standards of their children. The girls' friendships were closely policed. When they broke their parent's favourite vase, they were whipped as a punishment.\n\nRoger Viollet via Getty Images Her parents wanted Brigitte Bardot to become a ballet dancer\n\nWith German troops occupying Paris during World War II, Bardot spent most of her time at home, dancing to records. Her mother encouraged her interest and enrolled her in ballet classes from the age of seven. Her teacher at the Paris Conservatoire described her as an outstanding pupil, and she went on to win awards.\n\nLife as a 'jeune fille'\n\nBut Bardot found life claustrophobic. By the age of 15, she later recalled, \"I was seeking something, perhaps a fulfilment of myself.\" A family friend persuaded her to pose for the cover of Elle, the leading women's magazine in France, and the photographs caused a sensation.\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images Brigitte Bardot's early magazine covers redefined fashion and the concept of beauty\n\nAt the time, fashionable women had short hair, carefully matched their accessories, and sported tailored jackets and silky evening wear. Brigitte's hair flowed around her shoulders. With the lithe, athletic body of the ballerina, she was nothing like her fellow models. Pictured in a series of young, modish outfits, she became the personification of a new \"jeune fille\" (young girl) style. At the age of 16, she found herself the most famous cover girl in Paris. Her pictures caught the attention of the film director Marc Allegret, who instructed his assistant, Roger Vadim, to track her down.\n\nQUINIO/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was infatuated with aspiring director Roger Vadim\n\nThe screen tests were not successful, but Vadim - who was six years older - took her on, first as his protégé and then as his fiancée. They began an intense affair, but when Bardot's parents found out, they threatened to send her away to England.\n\nS.N. Pathe Cinema/Getty Images Roger Vadim helped his teenage wife launch her film career\n\nRoger Vadim, her 'wild wolf'\n\nIn retaliation, she attempted to take her own life, but was discovered and stopped just in time. Brigitte was infatuated with the aspiring director. He seemed to her as a \"wild wolf\". \"He looked at me, scared me, attracted me, and I didn't know where I was anymore,\" she later explained.\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images Bardot and Vadim on their wedding day at the Church of Passy, Paris, 12 December 1952. Vadim sold the pictures of the ceremony to Paris-Match\n\nUnder such pressure, her parents relented, but forbade the couple from marrying until Brigitte was 18. As soon as that milestone was passed, the couple walked down the aisle.\n\nBecoming an icon\n\nVadim began to mould Bardot into the star that he believed she could be. He sold the pictures of their wedding to Paris-Match and instructed her in how to perform in public. He helped his new wife find small roles in a dozen minor films, often playing pouty-yet-innocent female love interests. But, until 1956, she was chiefly famous for posing in bikinis - until then a garment banned in Spain, Italy and much of America for being on the razor edge of decency - and popularising a beehive hairdo. Then came peroxide, and the part that made her a star. That year, Vadim's debut film, And God Created Woman, opened in Paris. It failed to make money in France, but caused uproar in the United States.\n\nMarka/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Bardot created uproar in And God Created Woman\n\nIn a country used to Doris Day, Bardot was a sensation. Her character pursues her sexual appetites, without shame, as men do. She dances barefoot in a trance, her skin glowing with sweat, with her hair worn wild and loose. Her lack of inhibition causes social order to collapse; outside the cinema, the reaction was just as intense. The existentialist Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\" - raising Brigitte to the status of a philosophy. But the American moral majority mobilised. The film was banned in some states, and newspapers denounced its depravity. To audiences, Bardot became indistinguishable from the character she played. Paris-Match branded her \"immoral from head to toe\". And when Bardot ran off with her co-star, Jean-Louis Trintignant, her image as a wanton libertine was inescapable.\n\nAtlantis Films/Pictorial Parade/Courtesy of Getty Images Existentialist philosophers hailed Bardot as an icon of \"absolute freedom\"\n\nShe divorced Vadim, who reacted as only a Frenchman could. \"I prefer to have that kind of wife,\" he said, \"knowing she is unfaithful, rather than possess a woman who just loved me and no-one else.\" He went on to work with Bardot again, and later live with Catherine Deneuve and marry Jane Fonda.\n\nA reluctant mother\n\nIn 1959, Brigitte - after several love affairs - married the actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she starred in Babette Goes To War. The couple had a son, Nicolas, but Bardot resented her pregnancy: repeatedly punching herself in the stomach and begging a doctor for morphine to induce a miscarriage. \"I looked at my flat, slender belly in the mirror like a dear friend upon whom I was about to close a coffin lid,\" she later recalled.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Bardot resented her pregnancy and was later sued by her son for emotional damage\n\nAfter the inevitable divorce, Nicolas did not see his mother for decades. He sued Bardot for emotional damage when she published an autobiography in which she stated that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\". Brigitte was now the highest paid actress in France, with some suggesting that she was more valuable in terms of foreign trade than the country's car industry. But she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress. \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\" She began to attract the attention of Europe's most respected film-makers, winning critical acclaim in Jean-Luc Godard's powerful, New Wave drama, Le Mépris (Contempt). But the overall quality of her output was mixed, especially when she ventured outside France and into Hollywood. A third marriage, to a millionaire German playboy, was followed by a string of lovers - although, uncharacteristically, she did reject Sean Connery.\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty Images Bardot grew tired of her sex kitten image and quit acting to campaign for animal welfare. \"I have not had very much chance to act,\" she complained, \"mostly I have had to undress.\"\n\nShe made dozens of records, alongside Serge Gainsbourg and Sacha Distel. With Gainsbourg, she recorded the raunchy Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus, although she begged him not to release it. A year later, he re-recorded the song with the British actress, Jane Birkin. It became a huge hit all over Europe, with Bardot's version remaining under wraps for 20 years.\n\nAnimal rights campaigner\n\nAfter nearly 50 films, she announced she was retiring to devote her life to animal welfare in 1973. \"I gave my beauty and my youth to men\", she said. \"I'm going to give my wisdom and experience to animals\".\n\nPhilippe Caron/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nShe raised 3m francs (then about £300,000) to establish the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, by auctioning off her jewellery and film memorabilia. Bardot - or B.B. as she was known in France - campaigned against the annual seal cull in Canada, and irritated some of her countrymen by condemning the eating of horse meat. She became a vegetarian, attacked the Chinese government for \"torturing\" bears, and spent hundreds of thousands on a programme to sterilise Romanian stray dogs.\n\nSygma via Getty Images Bardot campaigned against the culling of seals and the fur trade, among other issues\n\nA troubled end to a troubled life\n\nIn her later years, she was prosecuted on multiple occasions for racial hatred. She objected to the way the Islamic and Jewish faiths slaughter animals for food. But the way she voiced her criticism was unforgivable, and - indeed - illegal. In 1999, she wrote that \"my homeland is invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims\". This landed Bardot with a huge fine. She went on to criticise interracial marriages and insult gay men who, in her words, \"jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air, and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through\". Bardot was in court so often that, in 2008, the prosecutor declared that he was \"weary\" of charging her.\n\nGilles BASSIGNAC/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Bardot was in court so often that the prosecutor said he was \"weary\" of charging her", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:18:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T10:27:02.614782"}

The cinema icon - BB as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare. Paying tribute, President Emmanuel Macron said France is mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\". Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.\n\nIn a statement, the animal welfare foundation she established said it was announcing her death with \"immense sadness\". The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said she was \"a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation.\" It did not specify where or when Bardot died. In a tribute on social media, President Macron wrote: \"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. \"French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.\" Another who paid tribute was French far-right politician Marine Le Pen: \"France loses an exceptional woman, through her talent, her courage, her frankness, her beauty.\" Bardot's husband, whom she married in 1992, was Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the late far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen - the father of Marine.\n\nHerbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty Images Bardot tore up the rule book of French cinema in the 1950s\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris in 1934 to a wealthy family, who wanted her to become a ballerina. She was discovered in her teens after posing on the cover of Elle magazine, swiftly becoming a sensation in her home country, and was persuaded to enter the cinema world. She played iconic roles, the most notable in the 1956 film And God Created Woman, directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim, in which she played a sexually liberated woman. The film scandalised the American public and was banned in some US states, while the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\".\n\nThrough the late 1950s and 1960s, she became a global phenomenon with roles in The Truth, earning critical acclaim for her dramatic depth; Contempt, a Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece; and Viva Maria!, showcasing her comedic flair alongside Jeanne Moreau. Beyond her most iconic roles, Bardot showcased her versatility in films like Love on a Pillow, where she portrayed a complex, emotionally-torn character, and Two Weeks in September, a romantic drama that highlighted her ability to convey vulnerability. In The Bear and the Doll, she brought playful charm to a comedic role, proving her range across genres. These films, though less celebrated, underscored her ability to captivate audiences in diverse narratives. As well as her work in film, Bardot will also be remembered as a fashion icon, with her blonde tousled hair and bold eyeliner setting beauty trends worldwide. After wearing an off-the-shoulder number in Cannes in 1953, similar styles became known as the Bardot neckline. She was married four times and had one son, Nicolas, with French actor and film producer Jacques Charrier, who died in September. Nicolas later sued his mother for emotional damage after she wrote in an autobiography that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\".\n\nKeystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images Bardot, Jacques Charrier and their three-day-old son Nicolas in 1960\n\nRuthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress. At the height of her fame, she announced she was retiring at the age of 39 to devote her life to animal welfare. \"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals,\" Bardot famously declared. In 1986, she launched the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which works to protect wild and domestic animals. She became a vegetarian, and in 2013 even threatened to apply for Russian citizenship in protest against plans to kill two sick elephants in a French zoo. Reacting to her death, France's oldest animal protection association - The Société Protectrice des Animaux - paid tribute to an \"iconic and passionate figure for the animal cause\".\n\nCharly Hel/Prestige/Getty Images Bardot, pictured here in 2001, became an increasingly controversial figure in her later life", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:34:26 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T14:24:54.688115"}

This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nIt is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.\n\nKurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.\n\nArben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.\n\nThere is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.\n\nRepairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.\n\nThe EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.\n\nThe fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.\n\nOne analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power.\n\nBut he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:27:02 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T02:22:43.143033"}

The army, navy, air force and rocket force would be dispatched for the drills scheduled for Tuesday, which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said. Codenamed \"Justice Mission 2025\", the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms. Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.\n\nTaiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms. Taiwan's defence ministry said that they detected Chinese aircraft and ships around Taiwan on Monday morning, and have deployed their own forces and missile systems to monitor the situation. Its forces are on \"high alert\" to defend Taiwan and \"protect our people\", the ministry said. In a post on Weibo, the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command - in charge of the Taiwan Strait - described the upcoming military exercise as a \"shield of justice\". \"All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield!\" the post read. While China has long called for the \"peaceful reunification\" with Taiwan, it also has a law stating it will resort to \"non-peaceful means\" to prevent the island's \"secession\". Beijing has accused Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te of pursuing \"Taiwan independence\". The president maintains Taiwan is already a sovereign nation and therefore has no need to formally declare independence. On Sunday, Lai said in a local television interview that Taiwan needed to \"keep raising the difficulty so [China] can never meet the standard\" for an invasion. He also said that his administration was committed to \"maintaining the status quo\" and would not provoke China - though he added that peace relies on \"real strength\". Polls consistently show that most Taiwanese people want the \"status quo\", meaning they neither want to unify with China, nor to formally declare independence.\n\nCCTV Chinese state media published a map released by the military showing Tuesday's drill locations around Taiwan\n\nSince 2022 Beijing has ramped up military drills in the Taiwan Strait, usually in response to what it deems as threats such as former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and Lai's inauguration in 2024. China's last live-fire exercise in the Taiwan Strait, held in April, simulated strikes on key ports and energy facilities, the People's Liberation Army said at the time. Along with the drills, the Chinese military released a series of cartoons depicting Lai as a \"parasite\". This week's military drills are the first to be held under Yang Zhibin, the new chief of the Eastern Theater Command who assumed his role in October. Taiwan holds military exercises of its own, both to prepare its population for an attack and showcase its defences to Beijing. This year's Han Kuang exercise, which took place over 10 days, was the largest and longest one yet. Since taking office, Lai has vowed to boost defence spending and enhance the island's defence capabilities in the face of increasing tensions with Beijing.

I watched the Cold War reach its height, then simply evaporate. But I've never seen a year quite as worrying as 2025 has been - not just because several major conflicts are raging but because it is becoming clear that one of them has geopolitical implications of unparalleled importance. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the current conflict in his country could escalate into a world war. After nearly 60 years of observing conflict, I've got a nasty feeling he's right.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Ukraine's President has warned that the current conflict in Ukraine could escalate into a world war\n\nNato governments are on high alert for any signs that Russia is cutting the undersea cables that carry the electronic traffic that keeps Western society going. Their drones are accused of testing the defences of Nato countries. Their hackers develop ways of putting ministries, emergency services and huge corporations out of operation. Authorities in the west are certain Russia's secret services murder and attempt to murder dissidents who have taken refuge in the West. An inquiry into the attempted murder in Salisbury of the former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skrypal in 2018 (plus the actual fatal poisoning of a local woman, Dawn Sturgess) concluded that the attack had been agreed at the highest level in Russia. That means President Putin himself.\n\nThis time feels different\n\nThe year 2025 has been marked by three very different wars. There is Ukraine of course, where the UN says 14,000 civilians have died. In Gaza, where Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu promised \"mighty vengeance\" after about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 and 251 people were taken hostage. Since then, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action, including more than 30,000 women and children according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry – figures the UN considers reliable. Meanwhile there has been a ferocious civil war between two military factions in Sudan. More than 150,000 people have been killed there over the past couple of years; around 12 million have been forced out of their homes. Maybe, if this had been the only war in 2025, the outside world would have done more to stop it; but it wasn't. \"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump, as his aircraft flew him to Israel after he had negotiated a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting. It's true that fewer people are dying in Gaza now. Despite the ceasefire, the Gaza war certainly doesn't feel as though it's been solved. Given the appalling suffering in the Middle East it may sound strange to say the war in Ukraine is on a completely different level to this. But it is.\n\nAFP via Getty Images \"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump\n\nThe Cold War aside, most of the conflicts I've covered over the years have been small-scale affairs: nasty and dangerous, certainly, but not serious enough to threaten the peace of the entire world. Some conflicts, such as Vietnam, the first Gulf War, and the war in Kosovo, did occasionally look as though they might tip over into something much worse, but they never did. The great powers were too nervous about the dangers that a localised, conventional war might turn into a nuclear one. \"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,\" the British Gen Sir Mike Jackson reportedly shouted over his radio in Kosovo in 1999, when his Nato superior ordered British and French forces to seize an airfield in Pristina after the Russian troops had got there first. In the coming year, 2026, though, Russia, noting President Trump's apparent lack of interest in Europe, seems ready and willing to push for much greater dominance. Earlier this month, Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to. At a later televised event he said: \"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours\".\n\nGetty Images Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to\n\nBut already Russia, a major world power, has invaded an independent European country, resulting in huge numbers of civilian and also military deaths. It is accused by Ukraine of kidnapping at least 20,000 children. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his involvement in this, something Russia has always denied. Russia says it invaded in order to protect itself against Nato encroachment, but President Putin has indicated another motive: the desire to restore Russia's regional sphere of influence.\n\nAmerican disapproval\n\nHe is gratefully aware that this last year, 2025, has seen something most Western countries had regarded as unthinkable: the possibility that an American president might turn his back on the strategic system which has been in force ever since World War Two. Not only is Washington now uncertain it wants to protect Europe, it disapproves of the direction it believes Europe is heading in. The Trump administration's new national security strategy report claims Europe now faces the \"stark prospect of civilisational erasure\". The Kremlin welcomed the report, saying it is consistent with Russia's own vision. You bet it is. Inside Russia, Putin has silenced most internal opposition to himself and to the Ukraine war, according to the UN special rapporteur focusing on human rights in Russia. He's got his own problems, though: the possibility of inflation rising again after a recent cooling, oil revenues falling, and his government having had to raise VAT to help pay for the war.\n\nGetty Images US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky clashed during a meeting at the White House in February 2025\n\nThe economies of the European Union are 10 times bigger than Russia's; even more than that if you add the UK. The combined European population of 450 million, is over three times Russia's 145 million. Still, Western Europe has seemed nervous of losing its creature comforts, and was until recently reluctant to pay for its own defence as long as America can be persuaded to protect it. America, too, is different nowadays: less influential, more inward-looking, and increasingly different from the America I've reported on for my entire career. Now, very much as in the 1920s and 30s, it wants to concentrate on its own national interests. Even if President Trump loses a lot of his political strength at next year's mid-term elections, he may have shifted the dial so far towards isolationism that even a more Nato-minded American president in 2028 might find it hard to come to Europe's aid. Don't think Vladimir Putin hasn't noticed that.\n\nThe risk of escalation\n\nThe coming year, 2026, does look as though it'll be important. Zelensky may well feel obliged to agree to a peace deal, carving off a large part of Ukrainian territory. Will there be enough bankable guarantees to stop President Putin coming back for more in a few years' time? For Ukraine and its European supporters, already feeling that they are at war with Russia, that's an important question. Europe will have to take over a far greater share of keeping Ukraine going, but if the United States turns its back on Ukraine, as it sometimes threatens to do, that will be a colossal burden.\n\nGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty Images If the United States turns its back on Ukraine, that will be a colossal burden for Europe\n\nBut could the war turn into a nuclear confrontation? We know President Putin is a gambler; a more careful leader would have shied away from invading Ukraine in February 2022. His henchmen make bloodcurdling threats about wiping the UK and other European countries off the map with Russia's vaunted new weapons, but he's usually much more restrained himself. While the Americans are still active members of Nato, the risk that they could respond with a devastating nuclear attack of their own is still too great. For now.\n\nChina's global role\n\nAs for China, President Xi Jinping has made few outright threats against the self-governed island of Taiwan recently. But two years ago the then director of the CIA William Burns said Xi Jinping had ordered the People's Liberation Army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. If China doesn't take some sort of decisive action to claim Taiwan, Xi Jinping could consider this to look pretty feeble. He won't want that. You might think that China is too strong and wealthy nowadays to worry about domestic public opinion. Not so. Ever since the uprising against Deng Xiaoping in 1989, which ended with the Tiananmen massacre, Chinese leaders have monitored the way the country reacts with obsessive care. I watched the events unfold in Tiananmen myself, reporting and even sometimes living in the Square.\n\nAFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool President Xi Jinping (centre) has made few outright threats against Taiwan recently\n\nThe story of 4 June 1989 wasn't as simple as we thought at the time: armed soldiers shooting down unarmed students. That certainly happened, but there was another battle going on in Beijing and many other Chinese cities. Thousands of ordinary working-class people came out onto the streets, determined to use the attack on the students as a chance to overthrow the control of the Chinese Communist Party altogether. When I drove through the streets two days later, I saw at least five police stations and three local security police headquarters burned out. In one suburb the angry crowd had set fire to a policeman and propped up his charred body against a wall. A uniform cap was put at a jaunty angle on his head, and a cigarette had been stuck between his blackened lips. It turns out the army wasn't just putting down a long-standing demonstration by students, it was stamping out a popular uprising by ordinary Chinese people. China's political leadership, still unable to bury the memories of what happened 36 years ago, is constantly on the look-out for signs of opposition - whether from organised groups like Falun Gong or the independent Christian church or the democracy movement in Hong Kong, or just people demonstrating against local corruption. All are stamped on with great force. I have spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989, watching its rise to economic and political dominance. I even came to know a top politician who was Xi Jinping's rival and competitor. His name was Bo Xilai, and he was an anglophile who spoke surprisingly openly about China's politics. He once said to me, \"You'll never understand how insecure a government feels when it knows it hasn't been elected.\" As for Bo Xilai, he was jailed for life in 2013 after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.\n\nJohn Simpson has spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989 (pictured in Tiananmen Square, 2016)\n\nAltogether, then, 2026 looks like being an important year. China's strength will grow, and its strategy for taking over Taiwan - Xi Jinping's great ambition - will become clearer. It may be that the war in Ukraine will be settled, but on terms that are favourable to President Putin. He may be free to come back for more Ukrainian territory when he's ready. And President Trump, even though his political wings could be clipped in November's mid-term elections, will distance the US from Europe even more. From the European point of view, the outlook could scarcely be more gloomy. If you thought World War Three would be a shooting-match with nuclear weapons, think again. It's much more likely to be a collection of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, which will see autocracy flourish. It could even threaten to break up the Western alliance. And the process has already started.

While both the US and Ukrainian presidents described the talks as \"great\", Trump reiterated that a key sticking point was the question of territory. Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine hand over more land. Addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky said they had come to an agreement on \"90%\" of a 20-point peace plan, while Trump said a security guarantee for Ukraine was \"close to 95%\" done. Zelensky later said US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week for further talks on issues aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nReuters\n\n\"We had a substantive conversation on all issues and highly value the progress that the Ukrainian and American teams have made over the past weeks,\" Zelensky said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. A proposal to turn the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Russia largely controls, into a demilitarised zone remains \"unresolved\", Trump said. \"Some of that land has been taken,\" he told reporters after the meeting. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months.\" Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas. Russia wants Ukraine to pull back from the small part of the territory it still controls in Donbas, while Kyiv has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by Ukrainian forces. The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back. He later reversed course. \"[That] is a very tough issue,\" he said. \"One that will get resolved.\" Security guarantees for Ukraine are \"95% done\", Trump said, without formally committing to logistical support or troop deployment to help protect Ukraine from future attacks. Trump floated the possibility of trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine, saying it could happen \"at the right time\". While the US president is keen to add the Ukraine-Russia war to the list of conflicts he claims to have ended, he cautioned that stalled or scrapped talks that go \"really badly\" could mean that the war continues.\n\nTrump: Agreement on Donbas 'unresolved' but 'getting closer'", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 02:06:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T06:50:56.089553"}

That is how it is for Ahmed, 18. He emerges from a mosque in the heart of Gaziantep in south-east Turkey - not far from the Syrian border - wearing a black T-shirt with \"Syria\" written on the front. His family fled his homeland when he was five years old, but he is planning to go back in a year or two at most. \"I am impatient to get there,\" he tells me. \"I am trying to save money first, because wages in Syria are low.\" Still, he insists the future will be better there. \"Syria will be rebuilt and it will be like gold,\" he says.\n\nIf he goes back, he will be following in the footsteps of more than half a million Syrians who have left Turkey since the ousting of Syria's long-time dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in December 2024. Many had been here since 2011, when civil war began devouring their country. In the years that followed, Turkey became a safe haven, taking in more Syrians than any other country. The number reached 3.5 million at its peak, causing political tension and - on occasion - xenophobic attacks. Officially, no Syrian will be forced to go, but some feel they are being pushed - by bureaucratic changes, and by a waning welcome. Civil society organisations \"are getting the message from the authorities that it's time to go\", says a Syrian woman who did not want to be named. \"I have a lot of good Turkish friends. Even they and my neighbours have asked why I am still here. Of course we will go back, but in an organised way. If we all go back together, it will be chaos.\"\n\nGetty Images Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December 2024\n\nAya Mustafa, 32, is eager to leave - but not yet. We meet under a winter sun by the stone walls of a castle, which has towered over Gaziantep since the Byzantine era. Her hometown, Aleppo, is less than two hours' drive away. She says going back is a constant topic of conversation in the Syrian community. \"Every day, every hour, we speak about this point,\" says Aya, whose family were lawyers and teachers back home, but had to start again in Turkey, baking and hairdressing to earn a living. \"We are talking about how we can return, and when, and what we can do. But there are many challenges, to be honest. Many families have children who were born here and can't even speak Arabic.\" Then there is the level of destruction in new Syria - where war has done its worst - and where the interim president, Ahmed Al Sharaa, is a former senior leader of Al Qaeda who has worked to reinvent his image. Aya saw the ruins of Aleppo for herself when she went back to visit. Her family home is still standing but now occupied by someone else. \"It's a big decision to go back to Syria,\" she says, \"especially for people with elderly relatives. I have my grandmother and my disabled sister. We need the basics like electricity and water and jobs to survive there.\" For now, she says, her family can't survive in Syria, but they will return in time. \"We believe that day will come,\" she says, with a broad smile. \"It will take some years [to rebuild]. But in the end, we will see everyone in Syria.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Syria's interim President, Ahmed Al Sharaa, is a former leader of Al Qaeda who has worked to reinvent his image\n\nA short drive away, we get a very different view from a Syrian family of four - father, mother and two teenage sons. The father - who does not want to be named - runs an aid organisation helping his fellow countrymen. Over glasses of tea and helpings of baklava, I ask if he and his family would move back. His response is swift and adamant. \"No, not for me and for my family,\" he says. \"And the same goes for my organisation. We have projects inside Syria, and we hope to extend that activity. But my family and my organisation will stay here in Turkey.\" Asked why, he lists problems with the economy, security, education and the health system. Syria's interim government \"hasn't any experience to deal with the situation\", he tells me. \"Some ask us to give them a chance, but one year has passed and the indications are not good.\" He too has visited the new Syria, and, like Aya, was not reassured. \"The security situation is very bad,\" he says. \"Every day there are killings. Regardless of who the victims are, they have souls.\" His voice softens when he speaks of his 80-year-old father in Damascus, who hasn't seen his grandsons for 12 years, and may never see them again. For now, he and his family can remain in Turkey, but he's already making contingency plans in case government policy changes. \"Plan A is that we will stay here in Turkey,\" he says. \"If we cannot, I'm thinking about plan B, C and even D. I am an engineer, always planning.\" None of those plans involve a return to Syria.\n\nIf going home is hard, staying in Turkey isn't easy either. Syrians have \"temporary protection\" that comes with restrictions. They are not supposed to leave the cities where they are first registered. Work permits are hard to get, and many are in low paid jobs, living on the margins. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who backed the uprising against Assad - has insisted that no Syrian will be driven out, but refugee advocates say there are growing pressures beneath the surface. They point to the ending of free medical care for Syrians from January, and new government regulations which make it more expensive to hire them. \"These new elements cast a shadow over how voluntary returns are,\" says Metin Corabatir, who heads an independent Turkish research centre on asylum and migration, IGAM. And he says presidential and parliamentary elections – due by 2028 – may be another threat for Syrians here. \"Normally President Erdogan is their main protector,\" Mr Corabatir tells me. \"He says they can stay as long as they want. And he repeated this after the regime changed. But if there is an election, and a political gain for the AKP [ruling party] to make, there might be some policy changes.\"\n\nGetty Images More than half a million Syrians have left Turkey since the ousting of Assad", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:05:53 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T06:50:56.249882"}

Any decisions made could have a potentially momentous impact on questions that determine the future of the region. The US has been Israel's strongest military and political backer throughout two years of war in Gaza and many are now looking to the meeting as a test of the leaders' relationship and how aligned they are on key topics. It will be their sixth meeting since Trump's return to office 11 months ago.\n\nAmong the expected points of discussion is the future of relations with Syria's new government, Iranian rearmament, and Hezbollah's role in Lebanon. Perhaps most critically, they will discuss progress of the Gaza ceasefire deal, where Israel's government has taken several positions diverging from those of the US government.\n\nThe talks will take place as storms continue to lash Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians remain living in basic tents that offer little protection from the cold and flooding. On Monday, the death of a two-month-old baby due to the severe cold was reported by the Hamas-run health ministry, bringing the total killed by the wintry weather since 10 December to three, while another 17 people have been killed by damaged buildings collapsing in the storms. The UN and numerous aid agencies have accused Israel of not meeting its ceasefire obligations by continuing to restrict full access to basic supplies and equipment. Israel has said it is meeting its obligations in facilitating an increase in aid deliveries. The Trump administration wants to see the ceasefire progress to its second phase in January, whereby a Palestinian technocratic government would be established alongside the deployment of an international security force, Hamas would disarm, Israeli troops would withdraw, and the reconstruction of the devastated territory would begin. Critics have suggested that Netanyahu may instead seek to delay the progress of the ceasefire, saying he does not want to engage seriously with questions of a political future for Palestinians and will instead push for Hamas to fully disarm before Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. Hamas officials have repeatedly said that its full disarmament should take place alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state. The 20-point peace plan promoted by Trump and signed by both Israel and Hamas recognises Palestinian aspirations to a sovereign state, however Netanyahu and his ministers have consistently rejected Palestinian statehood since the ceasefire came into effect in October. Last week, Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country would build settlements in Gaza and would \"never fully withdraw\" from the territory even if Hamas disarms, despite this being a key tenet of the ceasefire deal.\n\nReuters Recent winter weather in Gaza has reportedly caused 20 deaths due to the collapse of damaged buildings or exposure to cold", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:52:16 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:28.384765"}

We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace.\" In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems. He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack. \"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised,\" he said. But he added that Russia does not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported. The claim by Moscow comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war. Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done. Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.

But $2 billion is just a fraction of what the US has traditionally spent on aid. In 2022 its contribution to the UN's humanitarian work was estimated at $17 billion (£12.6bn).\n\nIt comes amid huge cuts in US funding for humanitarian operations, and further cuts expected from other donors, such as the UK and Germany.\n\nThe announcement was made in Geneva by Jeremy Lewin, President Trump's Under Secretary for Foreign Assistance, and the UN's emergency relief chief, Tom Fletcher.\n\nThe United States has pledged $2 billion (£1.5bn) to fund United Nations (UN) humanitarian programmes, but has warned the UN it must \"adapt or die\".\n\nAnd the funding comes with some strings attached. Although UN donors do sometimes earmark specific projects, the UN funding prioritises just 17 countries, among them Haiti, Syria, and Sudan.\n\nAfghanistan and Yemen will not, Mr Lewin said, receive any money, adding that Washington had evidence that in Afghanistan UN funds were being diverted to the Taliban and that \"President Trump will never tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money going to terrorist groups\".\n\nSuch restrictions will be hard for aid agencies working in countries not on the list. The impact of funding cuts has already led to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Afghanistan, and reductions in food rations for displaced people in Sudan. Globally, child mortality, which has been declining, is set to rise this year.\n\nThe conditions placed on the new US funding also rule out spending money on projects related to tackling climate change, which Mr Lewin said were not \"life saving\", and not in \"the US interest\".\n\nMr Lewin, a Trump loyalist who reportedly masterminded the shutdown of USAID and the firing of its thousands of staff, warned the UN that it must \"adapt or die\", saying that the US \"piggy bank is not open to those organisations that just want to return to the old system\".\n\nThe US says funding must be focused and efficient, with no duplication among aid projects. These are qualities Tom Fletcher, and the entire UN system, say they wholeheartedly support. It's in no one's interests, least of all those of the estimated 200 people caught up in crises, for money to be spent unwisely.\n\nBut while the UN is gratefully welcoming the new US funding, there remain big questions about whether the conditions around it are too politicised. The fundamental principles of humanitarian aid are that it should be neutral, impartial, and directed at those most in need. Eliminating specific countries, or specific crises such as climate change, challenges those principles.\n\nBut, as it struggles with a continued funding crises, and, in Washington, a very skeptical donor, many in the UN will be acknowledging that $2 billion is better than nothing.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:51:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T18:38:17.726372"}

Climbers had been required to pay a deposit of $4,000 (£2964), which they would only get back if they brought at least 8kg (18lbs) of waste back down with them. It was hoped it would begin to tackle the rubbish problem on the world's highest peak, which is estimated to be covered in some 50 tonnes of waste. But after 11 years - and with the rubbish still piling up - the scheme is being shelved because it \"failed to show a tangible result\".\n\nDavid Liano Clean-up campaigns have usually focused on lower camps of Mt Everest as it is difficult and costly to operate at higher altitudes\n\nHimal Gautam, director at the tourism department, told the BBC that not only had the garbage issue \"not gone away\", but the deposit scheme itself had \"become an administrative burden\". Tourism ministry and mountaineering department officials told the BBC most of the deposit money had been refunded over the years - which should mean most climbers brought back their trash. But the scheme is said to have failed because the rubbish climbers have brought back is usually from lower camps - not the higher camps where the garbage problem is worst. \"From higher camps, people tend to bring back oxygen bottles only,\" said Tshering Sherpa, chief executive officer of the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, which runs an Everest checkpoint. \"Other things like tents and cans and boxes of packed foods and drinks are mostly left behind there, that is why we can see so much of waste piling up.\" Mr Sherpa said on average a climber produces up to 12kg (26lbs) of waste on the mountain where they spend up to six weeks for acclimatisation and climbing. Apart from the \"flawed rule\" that required climbers to bring back less trash than they produce, authorities in the Everest region said lack of monitoring has been the main challenge. \"Apart from the check point above the Khumbu Icefall, there is no monitoring of what climbers are doing,\" said Mr Sherpa. Nepalese authorities are hoping a new scheme will be more effective.\n\nGetty Images Even the lower parts of the Everest region below the base camp see abandoned waste by visitors and trekkers\n\nUnder the changed rule, officials said, a non-refundable clean-up fee from climbers will be used to set up a checkpoint at Camp Two and also deploy mountain rangers who will keep going to the higher parts of the mountain to make sure climbers bring down their trash. Tourism ministry officials said it will most probably be $4,000 per climber - the same amount as deposit money - and will come into effect once passed by the parliament. Mingma Sherpa, chairperson of the Pasang Lhamu rural municipality, said the change was something the Sherpa community had lobbied for for many years now. \"We had been questioning the effectiveness of the deposit scheme all this time because we are not aware of anyone who was penalised for not bringing their trash down. \"And there was no designated fund but now this non-refundable fee will lead to creation of a fund that can enable us to do all these clean-up and monitoring works.\"\n\nGetty Images Increasing number of climbers on Mount Everest has been a growing concern for sustainable mountaineering", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:46:24 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T20:31:02.374055"}

The US president, whose 20-point peace plan requires the militant group to disarm, made the comments as he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida for talks on Monday.

As peace efforts intensified in 2025 under pressure from US President Donald Trump's administration, 40% more obituaries of soldiers were published in Russian sources compared with the previous year. Overall, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. BBC News Russian has been counting Russian war losses together with independent outlet Mediazona and a group of volunteers since February 2022. We keep a list of named individuals whose deaths we were able to confirm using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves. The real death toll is believed to be much higher, and military experts we have consulted believe our analysis of cemeteries, war memorials and obituaries might represent 45-65% of the total. That would put the number of Russian deaths at between 243,000 and 352,000. The number of obituaries for any given period is a preliminary estimate of the confirmed losses, as some need additional verification and will eventually be discarded. But it can indicate how the intensity of fighting is changing over time.\n\n2025 starts with a relatively low number of published obituaries in January, compared with the previous months. Then the number rises in February, when Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked directly for the first time about ending the war in Ukraine. The next peak in August coincides with the two presidents meeting each other in Alaska, a diplomatic coup for Putin that was widely seen as an end to his international isolation. In October, when a planned second Russia-US summit was eventually shelved, and then in November, when the US presented a 28-point peace proposal, an average of 322 obituaries were published per day - twice the average in 2024. It is difficult to put increased Russian losses down to any one factor, but the Kremlin sees territorial gains as a way of influencing negotiations with the US in its favour: Putin aide Yuri Ushakov stressed recently that \"recent successes\" had had a positive impact.\n\nMurat Mukashev was among those who gambled on a quick peace deal, and it cost him his life. Mukashev was an activist who had never supported Putin's policies. Over the years, he had taken part in demonstrations against police violence and torture, and joined rallies for LGBT rights and the release of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's main opponent who died in prison in 2024.\n\nMurat Mukashev Murat Mukashev was never a Putin supporter and had protested against the war and police violence\n\nHe had repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on social media from 2022. Then, in early 2024, Mukashev was detained near his home in Moscow and charged with large-scale drug dealing. While his case was being tried he was offered a contract with the defence ministry, according to his friends and family. They saw the heavy charges levelled against him as a typical ploy to get people to sign up. A 2024 law allows the accused a way out of a criminal conviction if they join up - an attractive option in a country with an acquittal rate of less than 1%. Mukashev refused the offer, and the court sentenced him to 10 years in a high-security penal colony. In prison in November 2024, he changed his mind. Friends said he was encouraged by Trump's promises to end the war quickly and decided he needed to sign up as soon as possible to secure his release before a peace deal was reached. \"He saw this as a chance to be released instead of being imprisoned for 10 years of strict regime,\" reads a statement from his support group. There was no explanation of how he reconciled taking part in the war with his reluctance to kill. On June 11 2025, Mukashev died fighting as part of an assault squad in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine. Like him, the majority of Russians killed at the front in 2025 had nothing to do with the military at the start of the full-scale war, BBC figures show. But since the bloody battle for the city of Avdiivka in October 2023, there has been a steady increase in casualties among so-called \"volunteers\" - those who have voluntarily signed a contract since the start of the invasion. They now appear to form the majority of Russia's new recruits, as opposed to professional soldiers who joined the army before the invasion or those mobilised for military service afterwards. A year ago 15% of Russian military deaths were volunteers, but in 2025 it was one in three.\n\nReuters File pic of Russian recruits in Rostov region\n\nLocal governments, under pressure to maintain a constant flow of new recruits, advertise hefty pay-outs, meet people who have large debts and campaign in universities and colleges. This means that the Kremlin has been able to compensate for heavy losses at the front while avoiding the politically risky move of a large-scale mandatory mobilisation. By October, 336,000 people had signed up for the military this year, according to National Security Council deputy chief Dmitry Medvedev - well over 30,000 a month. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has since said that 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed every month. If both are right, Russia is still recruiting more soldiers than it is losing. Based on obituaries and relatives' accounts, most of those who signed up to fight did so voluntarily; but there are reports of pressure and coercion, especially on regular conscripts and those charged with criminal offences. Some recruits mistakenly believe that after they have signed up for a year they can return to their old life with money in their pockets. A new recruit can earn up to 10m roubles (£95,000; $128,000) in a year. In reality all contracts signed with the defence ministry since September 2022 are automatically renewed until the war is over.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:12:41 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T02:22:03.981332"}

In 2024, the band announced that they were leaving their record agency Ador, alleging workplace harassment which Ador denied. The move set off a legal tussle that was only resolved in October this year - following a court ruling which said that the band had to stay with Ador until 2029. A month later, all five members said they would return to their record label. But on Monday, Ador announced that it had terminated their contract with one of its members, Danielle Marsh - bringing to an end any hope of a full-group comeback and leaving fans devastated.\n\nMany took to social media with the slogan: \"NewJeans is five or nothing.\" Other fans also questioned why Marsh was singled out. \"Does this make any sense???

The statement also named two other NewJeans members: Hanni, who it said decided to remain with the label after \"extended conversations\" which included her family, and Minji, who is still in \"ongoing conversations\" with the agency.

Bardot died on Sunday aged 91. A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right. But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.\n\nBardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off. Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for women's liberty and abortion rights. Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour.\n\nBut Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred. Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague. But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion. \"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media. There are differing types of national tribute in France. Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018.

The Saudi foreign ministry accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for southern Yemen, to launch recent offensives in the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra.

Two of the trickiest issues in Washington's 20-point plan involve territory and the fate of Europe's biggest nuclear plant, which is currently occupied by Russia. The Kremlin agrees with Trump that negotiations are \"at a final stage\", and Zelensky's next step is to meet European leaders in France on 6 January, but any one of the sticking points could jeopardise a deal.\n\nFate of Ukraine's industrial heartland coveted by Putin\n\nVladimir Putin has not budged from his maximalist demand for the whole of Ukraine's industrial Donbas, although Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has offered a compromise. Russian forces occupy most of the Luhansk region in the east but little more than 75% of Donetsk, and Putin wants it all, including the remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. \"We can't just withdraw, it's out of our law,\" says Zelensky. \"It's not only the law. People live there, 300,000 people... We can't lose those people.\" He has proposed Ukrainian forces pull back from the area to create a demilitarised or free economic zone policed by Ukraine, if the Russians pull back the same distance too. The current line of contact would then be policed by international forces. It is difficult to imagine Putin agreeing to any of that, and Russia's generals have told him they are capturing Ukrainian territory fast.\n\nAnadolu via Getty Images The two eastern cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk are coming under regular Russian attack\n\n\"If the authorities in Kyiv don't want to settle this business peacefully, we'll resolve all the problems before us by military means,\" Putin has claimed. Both sides are widely seen as suffering from exhaustion, and analysts from the Institute for the Study of War have estimated it would take Russian forces until August 2027 to conquer the rest of Donetsk if they are able to maintain their current rate of advance - which is not a given. Zelensky's compromise would also require Russian troops to leave other areas of Ukrainian territory where they maintain a limited presence, including Kharkiv and Sumy region in the north, Dnipropetrovsk in the east and Myokolaiv in the south. Without movement on Donetsk, the chance of a peace deal looks unrealistic, but a Russian compromise may not be out of the question. Kremlin envoy Yuri Ushakov said recently \"it's entirely possible that there won't be any troops [in Donbas], either Russian or Ukrainian\", although he was adamant the territory would be part of the Russian Federation.\n\nUkraine's huge nuclear power plant in Russian hands\n\nEver since March 2022, Russia has occupied Europe's biggest nuclear plant at Enerhodar, on the banks of the Dnipro river. But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years - and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown. To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant. Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone. The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has said that is unrealistic and instead the US and Ukraine could jointly manage it 50-50, with the US deciding where half of the power went - by implication to Russia. Ukraine's problem is that Russia will not let it go and the head of Russia's Rosatom nuclear agency Alexei Likachev has stressed that only one entity - Russia - can run it and ensure its safety. He has held out the possibility that Ukraine could use electricity generated by the plant in the context of international co-operation. Compromise on this issue may not be insurmountable, but it would require a level of trust between two neighbouring states when none exists.\n\nWashington Post via Getty Images The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant dominates the skyline near the Dnipro river\n\nLack of mutual trust despite positive rhetoric\n\nIt is hard to imagine significant progress on the biggest sticking points when there is so little trust. When Trump suggested this week that Putin \"wants to see Ukraine succeed… including supplying energy… at very low prices\", Zelensky clearly did not believe a word of it - he does not consider Putin as serious about peace. \"I don't trust Russians and... I don't trust Putin, and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" the Ukrainian leader said. Russia has also shown little faith in Kyiv - accusing Ukrainian forces of targeting drones at a Putin residence in the Novgorod region, although it gave no evidence of the attack. Ukraine denies it even happened and believes it is a Russian pretext for further Russian strikes on government buildings in Kyiv.\n\nOther sticking points that could derail deal\n\nKyiv has asked the US and European leaders for security guarantees to ensure a Nato-style response in the event of a further Russian attack. Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military. Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine. Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it. Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult. Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU. Few believe it will happen very soon.\n\nCould Ukrainians hold a vote on a deal?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:33:40 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T17:37:48.641121"}

A police spokesman likened the break-in to the Hollywood heist film Ocean's Eleven, telling AFP news agency it was \"very professionally executed\". During the heist at Sparkasse savings bank in the city of Gelsenkirchen, thieves broke open more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes containing money, gold and jewellery.

Yemen could yet become only one theatre in which the two vastly wealthy Gulf states vie for political influence, control of shipping lanes and commercial access.\n\nThe UAE has been dabbling in Yemen for years due to its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council.\n\nMany observers, including diplomats in Riyadh, had assumed that the UAE – often thought of as the junior if more ideological partner – would back down and tell the STC to delay or jettison its plan to declare independence and instead settle for negotiations on greater autonomy or more seats in Yemen’s coalition government body, the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC).\n\nSaudi Arabia had always seen Yemen as its preserve, first trying to defeat the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the north with a much-criticised bombing campaign in 2015 and then under international pressure reverting to diplomacy to try to reconcile the Houthis with the UN-recognised government in Aden.\n\nBut in the past month, the UAE has kicked over many assumed red lines in Yemen, leading to the Saudi bombing of vehicles docking at the Yemen port of Mukalla. Riyadh pointedly said the vehicles had been sent for STC use and had come from an Emirati port.\n\nSaudi Arabia said: “The Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat.”\n\nBut the UAE has been quietly considering commercial opportunities in Yemen for years. Tapping into the genuine, popular desire to restore the independence the south enjoyed prior to unification with the north in 1990, the UAE chose the STC as its vehicle.\n\nIt was a shrewd bet. The STC was finally recognised as a genuine player in 2019 when it was given seats on the PLC.\n\nAfter years being sidelined in UN peace efforts, the STC leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, slowly gained western recognition and was allowed to attend events such as the UN general assembly.\n\nBut the STC, feeding off longstanding cultural and economic grievances with the north, was never content with federalist solutions, and felt anyway it had been sidelined in the PLC.\n\nThis month, the STC grabbed its opportunity, sending in its forces into Hadramaut, the largest governorate in the south.\n\nWith its sudden eastward expansion, the STC controlled nearly all of the territory of the former South Yemen state, including its most productive oilfields.\n\nAfter seizing Hadramaut, it was relatively easyto take al Mahra, the most easterly governorate.\n\nIt was a severe shock to Saudi Arabia, which has since been applying diplomatic pressure on Abu Dhabi to demand the STC’s withdrawal.\n\nIn a ferocious diplomatic battle, Riyadh tried to isolate the UAE and the STC, making it clear that even if the STC stood its ground, southern Yemen would never progress beyond a micro-state lacking international recognition.\n\nSo far, the UAE is not buckling. The withdrawal of the few remaining UAE counter terror forces in Yemen announced on Tuesday is of no significance since UAE support for the STC remains.\n\nAbdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist, is portraying the UAE defence of the STC almost as a litmus test of the UAE’s character. He wrote on X: “The UAE does not let down nor abandon its allies. It supports them with generosity and political and military abundance. It does not leave them midway on the road to face their fate without support. It is clear in its policies and steps. It does not flee nor evade confrontation. It has a clear vision of its national and humanitarian responsibility and fulfils it with utmost care.”\n\nEqually patriotic statements are emerging from Riyadh. Farea al-Muslimi the Yemen and wider Gulf research fellow at Chatham House, is in little doubt about the enormity of what may be at stake.\n\n“After years of indirect competition through local proxies, the dispute now appears to be moving toward a more direct confrontation, with Saudi Arabia publicly accusing the UAE of actions that threaten its national security along its southern border,” he said.\n\n“The conflict reflects fundamental disagreements between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over the future political structure of Yemen and the balance of influence within it. Notably, the UAE – despite its greater geographic distance – has pursued a more interventionist and experimental approach on the ground.\n\n“Tensions between the two countries have been building for years. These actions suggest that the situation is entering a particularly dangerous phase. This development also evokes troubling parallels with the 2017 Gulf crisis involving Qatar, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE coordinated a major diplomatic rupture that destabilised regional relations for years.”\n\nAl-Muslimi added that the Houthis were “likely to view the growing rift between two of their principal adversaries with considerable advantage, observing as former coalition partners – who jointly fought and failed to defeat them – now turn against one another”.\n\nWestern governments, taking their lead from Washington, have shown in Sudan little desire to criticise the UAE in public, and in Yemen their sympathies will be with Saudi Arabia and the retention of a unitary state.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:19:44 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T17:37:49.379916"}

He said staff had told him there was a \"50% chance we go to Paris, 50% chance we go back to London\".\n\n\"I guess my new year plan is in the hands of the tunnel operators now,\" the 27-year-old Parisian said. Eurostar said it planned to run all of its services on Wednesday but warned there may still be some delays and cancellations. The service from London to Paris scheduled for 06:00 GMT has been cancelled. The problem with the overhead power supply and a broken down LeShuttle train blocked all routes on Tuesday, causing disruptions for thousands trying to get away for New Year's Eve. Some Eurostar and LeShuttle services had resumed on Tuesday evening, but delays remained, with only one of the tunnel's two rail lines open. Getlink, who run the Channel Tunnel, said work continued through the night to fix the power issue. On Wednesday morning, an update on Eurostar's website said: \"Services have resumed today following a power issue in the Channel Tunnel yesterday and some further issues with rail infrastructure overnight. \"We plan to run all of our services today, however due to knock-on impacts there may still be some delays and possible last-minute cancellations. \"Please check for live updates on the status of your train on the train status and timetables page.\"\n\nDennis van der Steen, from the Netherlands, was heading home to Amsterdam to spend New Year's Eve with his family and friends. Instead he said he spent six hours stuck on board a Eurostar train, before it began to move again at about 03:00 GMT. \"We're stuck,\" he told the BBC. He said there was no power onboard the train when it stopped, and that some passengers slept while others were \"also very worried\". He was later told his train would continue on its journey. Another passenger described feeling a \"rollercoaster of emotions\" for hours, not knowing whether the train he was on would be able to continue across the Channel or return to London. His train eventually made it to Brussels, he said, adding: \"Glad to be home, saw many families stranded.\"\n\nKelly North and Bethany Massey-Chase tell the BBC how they've had to re-book their Eurostar service to Paris\n\nImages of massive crowds of travellers stranded at London St Pancras International flooded social media following Tuesday's power outage. A photograph shared with the BBC by a train driver for Eurostar appeared to show overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks. Meanwhile, cars that had hoped to use the Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near the LeShuttle Terminal in Folkestone. Tim Brown, who had been trying to return to the UK after spending Christmas in Germany, told PA News he had been stuck in his car on the LeShuttle train for more than three hours with \"no access to food or water\". At least a dozen Eurostar services between the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had been cancelled by midday on Tuesday. The rail operator apologised and said passengers could rearrange their plans free of charge or can cancel their booking and get a refund or an e-voucher. On Tuesday, Eurostar has urged its customers \"to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available\". \"We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have been already been cancelled.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:56:15 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T04:59:53.179696"}

Zia, who was the country's first female prime minister, died on Tuesday from a prolonged illness. She was 80. The mourners held out their hands in prayer and carried flags printed with her photographs as a motorcade carrying Zia's body - including the hearse wrapped with the national flag - drove on streets near the parliament house.

Zia will be buried next to her husband Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 while serving as president - an incident that thrusted Zia into political limelight. She went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years. She was dubbed an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to participate in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s. Her career, which included spells in prison and house arrest, was defined by a bitter feud with her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina. Over the past 16 years, under Hasina's Awami League government, Zia emerged as the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule many saw as increasingly autocratic. Despite Zia's illness, the BNP said she had intended to run for parliament in February, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution last year unseated Hasina. According to the party's candidate list released earlier this month, Zia was to contest in three constituencies. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, Zia's son Tarique Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader.

Kaja Kallas' comments on social media appear to be a reference to the Kremlin's allegation that Ukraine attempted a drone strike on one of Vladimir Putin's residences. \"No one should accept unfounded claims from the aggressor who has indiscriminately targeted Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians,\" Kallas wrote on social media. Earlier this week Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia.\n\nRussia would review its position in the ongoing peace negotiations as a result, the Kremlin said. Since Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov first shared the claims, Russian state media and politicians have discussed the alleged attack in increasingly incendiary tones. \"The attack is a strike on the heart of Russia,\" said Andrei Kartapolov, head of the Russian parliament's defence committee. \"After what [Ukraine] has done, there can be no forgiveness.\" Although the Kremlin initially said it saw no point in sharing proof of the alleged attack, on Wednesday the Russian army released what it said was evidence of the attempted strike. It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot. The profile of the wrecked UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) does bear similarities to Ukrainian-produced Chakluns – but because the components of the drone pictured are inexpensive and widely available online, they cannot be conclusively to traced to the Ukrainian military.\n\nRussian defence ministry Russia's defence ministry released a map which it claimed showed the path of the drones launched by Ukraine\n\nRussia's defence ministry also released a video of what it said was a local resident who described hearing noises like a rocket at the time of the alleged attack. However, one Russian investigative media outlet said it had spoken to more than a dozen residents of the area around Putin's residence and none had heard anything that could indicate 91 drones had approached or been shot down by air defences. \"If something like that had happened, the whole city would have been talking about it,\" one person told the outlet. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has strenuously denied the allegations, tying them to the ongoing US-led process to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. In recent weeks the American and Ukrainian delegations have been working closely and Zelensky has expressed cautious optimism that his country's demands were going to be taken into account. In his view, he said on Tuesday, the claims about the drone attack on Putin's Valdai residence were about \"the fact that over the past month there were quite successful talks and a positive meeting between our teams, culminating in our meeting with President Trump.\" Russia wanted to disrupt the \"positive momentum\" between the US and Ukraine, Zelensky said. When the claims emerged Zelensky also warned that the alleged drone strike would be used as an excuse to carry out strikes on Kyiv and Ukrainian government buildings. Overnight on Wednesday air alerts briefly rang out in the capital as a drone approached, but no hits or damage were reported.\n\nState Emergency Service of Ukraine On 30 December Odesa suffered an intense attack which left several civilians injured\n\nInstead, several locations across the country were hit by drones and Odesa on the Black Sea suffered a large-scale attack which saw an apartment block hit and six people injured, including three children.

An overhaul of the tax system announced late last year removes many exemptions that were in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child rule. It also exempts marriage-related services and elderly care from value added tax (VAT) - part of a broader effort that includes extending parental leave and issuing cash handouts. Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young Chinese people to marry, and couples to have children.\n\nOfficial figures show that China's population has shrunk three years in a row, with just 9.54 million babies born in 2024. That is around half of the number of births recorded a decade ago, when China started to ease its rules on how many children people could have. Still, the tax on contraceptives, including condoms, birth control pills and devices, has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates, as well as ridicule. Some people point out that it would take a lot more than pricey condoms to persuade them to have children. As one retailer urged shoppers to stock up ahead of the price hike, a social media user joked: \"I'll buy a lifetime's worth of condoms now.\" People can tell the difference between the price of a condom and that of raising a child, wrote another. China is one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. Costs are pushed up by school fees in a highly competitive academic environment, and the challenge women have juggling work and parenting, the study said. The economic slowdown, partly brought on by a property crisis that has hit savings, has left families, and especially young people, feeling uncertain or less confident about their future. \"I have one child, and I don't want any more,\" says 36-year-old Daniel Luo, who lives in the eastern province of Henan. \"It's like when subway fares increase. When they go up by a yuan or two, people who take the subway don't change their habits. You still have to take the subway, right?\" He says he is not concerned by the price hike. \"A box of condoms might cost an extra five yuan, maybe 10, at most 20. Over a year, that's just a few hundred yuan, completely affordable.\"\n\nGetty Images Young couples in China, like elsewhere, are having fewer or no children\n\nBut cost might be a problem for others, and that's what worries Rosy Zhao, who lives in the city of Xi'an in central China. She says making contraception, which is a necessity, more expensive could mean students or those struggling financially \"take a risk\". That would be the policy's \"most dangerous potential outcome\", she added. Observers appear divided on the aim of the tax overhaul. The idea that a tax hike on condoms will impact birth rates is \"overthinking it\", says demographer Yi Fuxian from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He believes Beijing is keen to collect taxes \"wherever it can\" as it battles a housing market slump and growing national debt. At nearly $1tn (£742bn), China's VAT revenue made up close to 40% of the country's tax collection last year. The move to tax condoms is \"symbolic\" and reflects Beijing's attempts to encourage people to lift China's \"strikingly low\" fertility numbers, said Henrietta Levin from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is also hampering efforts, she adds, is that a lot of the policies and subsidies will have to be implemented by indebted provincial governments - and it's unclear if they can spare sufficient resources. China's approach to urging people to have children also risks backfiring if people feel the government is being \"too intrusive\" about what is deeply personal choice, she said. Recently there have been media reports that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about their menstrual cycles and plans to have children. The local health bureau in Yunnan province said such data was needed to identify expectant mothers. But this has not helped the government's image, Ms Levin said. \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\"\n\nGetty Images China is one of the priciest countries to raise a child, a study in 2024 found", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:07:11 GMT", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T23:43:40.031569"}

Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four years of conflict would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\". In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his troops that \"we believe in you and our victory\". Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence of Ukraine using drones to target Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied.\n\nIt included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot. Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said. However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.\n\nWatch: BBC's Steve Rosenberg asks Russians what they are hoping for in 2026\n\nIn his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas. Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear. \"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\" By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter. Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\" Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said.

Viewers rushed to watch the final episode, which concludes the 10-year run of the sci-fi horror series, as it was released at 01:00 GMT. Some fans also attended special cinema screenings of the finale in cities across the US and Canada, several of which were attended by the show's stars. Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, Stranger Things first aired in 2016 and stars Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder and David Harbour.\n\nThe dramatic two-hour series finale, titled Chapter Eight: The Rightside Up, initially overloaded Netflix servers. Several fans said they were shown an error message as they tried to play it - something that often happens with big new releases on streaming platforms. But the episode was soon restored and viewers were able to watch a finale that included massive battle scenes and emotional tributes that brought in all five seasons, giving closure to the characters that we've fallen in love with over the years. The finale left you on the edge of your seat at moments and had you both cheering and crying in others.\n\nNetflix Finn Wolfhard was cheered by fans as he arrived to introduce the finale at a screening in Vancouver\n\nA lot was riding on Netflix and The Duffer Brothers, who created the 1980s-inspired, monster-infused, inter-dimensional series. Ending any beloved series comes with both anticipation and a lot of critics. So far this season, fans have picked apart scenes and gone through past seasons in an attempt to piece together how it all might end in the Upside Down. Viewers have been quick to point out gaps in the story or issues they felt with the script writing, pointing out flaws in Will Byers' coming out scene or issues such as Holly Wheeler's jacket having a logo for Under Amour (a brand that wasn't created until 1996) appearing on screen. Countless theories discussed on social media only hyped up the ending of this saga. Fans guessed about possibilities like time travel coming into play (clocks have been a major plot point for multiple seasons, after all), took bets on what main character might die and some had far-fetched thoughts on Henry Creel \"Vecna\" using mind control on the characters throughout this season to explain various holes in the storytelling. In the end, some theories were spot on. Others, not one bit. Do not read any further if you do not want to know what happens in the finale of Stranger Things.\n\nGetty Images Actor Brett Gelman attended a screening in Topanga as part of the multi-city finale premiere\n\nNetflix These fans attended a screening in Los Angeles to watch the finale on the big screen\n\nGetty Images Actress Cara Buono attended a premiere in New York and introduced the finale from cinema stage\n\nIn the finale, we see an epic final fight that requires all the characters to finally defeat Vecna and the Mind Flayer before worlds merge and Hawkins, Indiana – and Earth as we know it – is taken over. We don't see dramatic deaths in the core group of stars we've come to love over five seasons – though we did see the death of Kali (Eight). What happened to Eleven, though, is up for interpretation. She is left with an impossible choice. At first, viewers are left to believe she chose to remain behind in the Upside Down as it explodes and is demolished forever in order to eliminate the possibility of being used to create more children with powers like hers. But later, in a lengthy epilogue scene, Mike Wheeler takes us down another possibility - Eleven using Kali's illusion powers to make it seem as though she died before making a grand escape.\n\nNetflix\n\nHe says he thinks she finally made it the place they talked about running off to – a land with three waterfalls. Mike says it's what he likes to believe – and each member of their Dungeons and Dragons party – Will, Dustin, Lucas and Max – all agree that they, too, believe. It's a fitting end that leaves open the possibility that Eleven, too, has a happy ending. The epilogue takes us 18 months into the future after the Upside Down is demolished and Vecna – and the Mind Flayer – is defeated. We see Hooper and Joyce get engaged and the older crew of teens talk about their lives in university and in their careers. It's a happy ending for everyone. But even with such an epic finale, there are certainly holes in the story that weren't fully explained in the last episode. It's sure to be a finale that pleases some fans and has others wanting more.\n\nGetty Images Several fans dressed up to attend the finale screenings - including this pair in Vancouver\n\nNetflix Netflix handed out merchandise such as bags, figurines and T-shirts at many of the screenings\n\nGetty Images Two fans in Vancouver, pictured with a special Demogorgon Crunch breakfast cereal\n\nIn the US and Canada, the finale was given a full cinematic release in theatres.

Thomas Byrnes, chief executive of MarketImpact, a consultancy for the humanitarian sector, has been tracking aid cuts throughout the past year and said the $2bn was significantly less than the $3.38bn in funds given by the US to the UN in 2025, all of which was provided under the previous Biden administration.\n\n“This is a carefully staged political announcement that obscures more than it reveals,” said Byrnes.\n\nHe said the contribution was better than nothing but that it would have a limited impact in the context of other US decisions, including cutting $5bn in foreign assistance already approved by Congress as “woke, weaponised and wasteful spending” and a proposal to end support for peacekeeping missions – for which it already owes the United Nations $1.5bn.\n\nByrnes suggested that channelling the money through Ocha may be less about partnership and more an attempt to centralise control and have one UN body on which to make demands about how aid should be distributed.\n\nPatz shared that concern and said he was worried about whether the money would even materialise if the UN failed to meet the expectations set out by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to “cut bloat, remove duplication”.\n\n“I would be cautious,” he said. “This is $2bn promised, but not $2bn given.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:00:40 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T13:37:42.303231"}

Instead, she said, body parts might have been removed as part of a funerary ritual, perhaps to be carried as tokens.\n\nDr Jessica Thompson, a senior author of the study from Yale University, said that, while such practices may not seem relatable, people still keep locks of hair or relatives’ ashes for scattering in a meaningful place.\n\nThe researchers said the rock shelter appears to have been used as a natural monument, with burials occurring from about 16,000 to 8,000 years ago. As well as complete skeletons, very small collections of bones from different individuals have been found.\n\n“[This] supports our hypothesis that some of the missing bones from the cremated woman may have been deliberately removed and taken as tokens for curation or reburial elsewhere,” said Dr Ebeth Sawchuk, a co-author of the study from the University of Alberta.\n\nThe team also found flakes and points from stone-knapping within the pyre, which might have been added as part of a funeral ritual.\n\n“Were people actively throwing these things into the fire or … were they in the body itself?” said Thompson. Cerezo-Román said one possibility is that people were knapping stones to cut the woman’s flesh.\n\nThe team also found the pyre was about the size of a queen-sized mattress, and would have taken considerable knowledge, skill and coordination to build and maintain, while the two clusters of bones indicate the body was moved during cremation.\n\nWhile it is unclear why the woman was given such special treatment, the team found at least one fire was subsequently made directly above the location of the pyre – possibly as an act of remembrance.\n\nHowever, the site also has evidence of multiple campfires, with Thompson noting it is likely the shelter would also have been used for daily life.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sharp points of grey flint and rock from stone-knapping found in the pyre.

On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million. Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analyst's estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole. The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.\n\nIn October, Tesla introduced lower-priced versions of its two best-selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales. It had faced criticism that it had been slow to release new and more affordable options to stay competitive. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn). As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\". Tesla sales slumped in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk's role in US President Donald Trump's administration. Besides Tesla, the multi-billionaire's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels. Those commitments, along with running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.

It previously accused the companies of selling their products at unfairly low prices and threatened tariffs of almost 92%.\n\nBut on Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry said the proposed rate had now been drastically cut back.\n\nThe move could have resulted in American importers being taxed at a rate greater than the value of the actual pasta itself, and prices rising sharply for US consumers.\n\nItalian pasta is set to be spared from high-level US tariffs that the Trump administration had threatened against 13 producers.\n\nTariffs are a type of tax paid by a consumer who imports a product.\n\nSince returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of these taxes, though some have since been softened.\n\nThe president has sought to address trade practices that he sees as harmful to the US and boost American manufacturing.\n\nBut economists have consistently warned that such moves can ultimately drive up costs for consumers, worsening cost-of-living issues.\n\nIn the case of pasta, the US alleged that Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, which undercut local producers. This pricing policy is sometimes known as dumping.\n\nThe commerce department was planning to charge a tariff rate of 91.74% for American imports of pasta made by the 13 Italian producers.\n\nGiven that there is now an underlying 15% tariff on most products bought into the US from the European Union, the plan would have resulted in the rate of tax on pasta exceeding 100% of its value.\n\nIt sparked fears of consumers experiencing major price increases, although the produce made by the 13 companies represents only a small share of total Italian pasta imported into the US.\n\nThe plan would have also represented a political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who enjoys a relatively close relationship with Trump among European leaders.\n\nOn Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry announced that the US had wound back its plan, saying this represented \"an acknowledgement by the US authorities of the constructive co-operation shown by Italian companies\".\n\nIn the case of one brand, La Molisana, the tariff rate had been dropped as low as 2.26%, the Italian statement added.

Both Gulf powers have intervened on behalf of Yemen's internationally recognised government in the country's long-running civil war, but a fracturing of the alliance has seen them backing different rival groups on the ground, one of whom is now pushing to declare the independence of a breakaway state in southern Yemen. On Friday, the UAE-backed force declared that a \"war\" had begun, accusing Saudi-backed ground forces of launching an attack alongside air strikes by the Saudi air force. Yemen's civil war broke out in 2014 and has plunged the already impoverished country into years of deadly violence and one of the world's worst hunger crises.\n\nAt the start of the war, the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement took control of most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the government. The conflict escalated in 2015, when a coalition of Arab states including Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched a military campaign to restore the government's rule. A ceasefire has de-escalated the conflict with the Houthis in recent years and led to a freezing of the front lines. But the Saudi-backed ruling coalition – the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), formed in 2022 and designed to unite various anti-Houthi factions - has frayed. At the same time, the vast majority of southern Yemen has been taken by UAE-backed separatists, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is formally part of the coalition.\n\nReuters Saudi Arabia warned the UAE that offensives in eastern Yemen constituted threats to its security\n\nThe infighting escalated on 2 December, when the STC - which seeks an independent state in the south - launched a large-scale military offensive in the east of the country and rapidly took control of territory from government forces. The STC's advances included the oil-rich Hadramawt province that borders Saudi Arabia. The STC said the offensive was necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south. But it was denounced as a \"rebellion\" by the head of the PLC, Rashad al-Alimi, who said the STC's separatist push threatened to fracture Yemen and plunge the region into chaos. Tensions have further escalated with air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition. On Friday, seven people were killed in an air strike on an STC military camp in Hadramawt, an STC official said. That followed air strikes on Tuesday on the southern port of Mukalla, where the coalition accused the UAE of delivering two ships loaded with military equipment to the separatists over the weekend. No casualties were reported but images of burnt-out vehicles shared on social media after the strikes suggested the strikes directly targeted the UAE hardware.\n\nAFP The Saudi-led coalition air strike on Mukalla destroyed a number of military vehicles and pick-up trucks\n\nThe UAE foreign ministry denied the allegations, saying the shipment did not contain weapons and that the vehicles were to be used by Emirati forces in the country. Following Tuesday's strikes, the head of Yemen's Presidential Council said it had cancelled a joint defence treaty with the UAE and ordered all its forces to leave the country within 24 hours. The Saudi foreign ministry backed the call for the Emirati forces to leave, accusing the UAE of pressuring the STC to launch the offensive in the east, which has reached Saudi Arabia's borders. The ministry warned that Saudi Arabia's national security was a \"red line\". The UAE denied it was behind the STC's recent military campaign but, in a move that was unexpected to many, hours later it conceded to the demand and agreed to withdraw its forces from Yemen.\n\nThe UAE's motivations in supporting the STC in Yemen are seen as helping it secure access to key sea ports and challenging an Islamist party that sits in the government. But even if the UAE fully removes its physical presence in Yemen, it \"won't change anything\" and does not signify a backdown of the STC forces it supports, says Farea al-Muslimi, a researcher at Chatham House. \"The UAE hasn't had a significant troop presence in Yemen since 2019. It has relied on special forces and mostly its network of proxies working directly on the ground,\" says Mr Muslimi.\n\nEPA More than 19 million people require humanitarian assistance in Yemen\n\nIn the newly contested areas like Hadramawt, the prospect of a wider conflagration of fighting is alarming families. \"Some people are thinking of going to villages or staying with relatives if things get worse. But most people don't really have the option to leave the city,\" says Mohamed from Mukalla. \"Most people are going out less [and] have stored some goods like flour and rice. Everyone is following the news closely, moment by moment.\" Years of devastating conflict have ravaged Yemen's economy. The country's roughly 40 million people have endured what aid agencies say is the world's third worst hunger crisis - one that has repeatedly threatened to reach famine levels. In 2021, the UN estimated that 377,000 people had died as a result of the conflict and its impact on hunger and healthcare, of which 259,000 were said to be children under the age of five. While the current conflict is being framed from the outside as an emerging proxy war between two Gulf powers, close watchers of Yemeni politics have seen the recent escalations by the STC as a long time coming. The STC's ambitions have risen after its recent expansion of control over nearly all of the south of the country, Yemeni affairs journalist Anwar al-Ansi told BBC Arabic. \"[STC chief Aidarous] Al-Zubaidi has been the most consistent person inside Yemen, consistently demanding independence for southern Yemen. So, no, I don't think he will give up,\" says Mr Muslimi.\n\nReuters The Southern Transitional Council wants an independent state in south Yemen", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:59:53 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:42.633803"}

The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Trump said Venezuela's left-wing president and his wife were flown out of the country in a military operation in conjunction with US law enforcement. Explosions were reported across Venezuelan's capital, Caracas, in the early hours of Saturday morning, including at military bases. The Venezuelan government has demanded proof Maduro is alive and deployed its armed forces. A national emergency has been declared in the country. Maduro's capture comes after heightened tensions between the two countries, with Washington striking boats in the Caribbean it says are being used to carry drugs. The US has accused Maduro of being personally involved in drug-smuggling and being an illegitimate leader. Maduro has, in turn, accused the US of intimidation. Here is what we know so far.\n\nWhat do we know about Maduro's capture?\n\nThere are few details about Maduro's capture. Trump did not give more details about how Maduro was detained or where he has been taken. Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta force – the military's top counter terrorism unit - according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Trump is due to hold a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida at 11:00 EST (16:00 GMT) at which further details about the operation may be disclosed.\n\nWhat happened during the strikes?\n\nAFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas\n\nAround 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT), loud explosions were heard in Caracas, while plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. Reports of places hit by strikes include military airfield, La Carlota, in the centre of the capital and the main military base of Fuerte Tiuna. Surrounding communities were also without power. Videos of explosions and helicopters flying overhead have been circulating on social media, but they have not been verified yet. It is not currently known if there have been any casualties. The Venezuelan government also said the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira were also hit.\n\nHow has Venezuela reacted?\n\nVenezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez said the government did not know where Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were, and demanded \"immediate proof of life\" for them both. The country's defence minister Vladimir Padrino López claimed the strikes hit civilian areas and said the government was compiling information about dead and injured people. He added that Venezuela would \"resist\" the presence of foreign troops. Venezuela's government issued an official statement denouncing the \"extremely serious military aggression\" by the US \"against Venezuelan territory and population in civilian and military locations\". It accused the US of threatening international peace and stability and described the attack as an attempt to seize \"Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals\" in an attempt to \"forcibly break the political independence of the nation.\"\n\nWhat has Donald Trump said?\n\nReuters\n\nImmediately after the explosions, the White House declined to public comment. But Trump later took to his Truth Social platform to confirm the US was behind the strikes. \"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\" Trump wrote. \"This operation was done in conjunction with US Law Enforcement.

It doesn't usually send in the military and physically remove them. Venezuela's abrupt awakening took two forms. Its residents were woken abruptly to the sound of deafening booms: the sound of its capital Caracas under attack from US strikes targeting military infrastructure. Its government has now woken up from any illusion that US military intervention or regime change was just a distant threat. US President Donald Trump has announced its leader, Nicolás Maduro, has been captured and flown out of the country. He now faces a US trial over weapons and drugs charges.\n\nThe US has not carried out direct military intervention in Latin America like this since its 1989 invasion of Panama to depose the then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega. Back then, like now, Washington framed this as part of wider crackdown on drug trafficking and criminality. The US has long accused Maduro, too, of leading a criminal trafficking organisation, something he strongly denies. It designated as a foreign terrorist group the 'Cartel de los Soles' - a name the US uses to describe a group of elites in Venezuela who it alleges orchestrate illegal activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining. For years, Maduro's government has been accused of human rights abuses. In 2020, United Nations investigators said its government had committed \"egregious violations\" amounting to crimes against humanity such as extrajudicial killings, torture, violence and disappearances - and that Maduro and other top officials were implicated. Human rights organisations have recorded hundreds of political prisoners in the country, including some detained after anti-government protests. This latest operation, striking inside a sovereign capital directly, marks a dramatic escalation in US engagement in the region. The forcible removal of Maduro will be hailed a major victory by some of the more hawkish figures within the US administration, many of whom have argued that only direct intervention could force Maduro from power. Washington has not recognised him as the country's president since the 2024 elections. The opposition published electronic voting tallies after the vote which it said proved it, not Maduro, won the election. The result was deemed neither free nor fair by international election observers. The opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was barred from running in it. But for Venezuela's government, this intervention confirms what it has long claimed - that Washington's ultimate goal is regime change.\n\nVenezuela has also accused the US of wanting to \"steal\" its oil reserves, the largest in the world, and other resources – an allegation it felt was vindicated after the US seized at least two oil tankers off the coast. The strikes and capture come after months of US military escalation in the region. The US has sent its biggest military deployment in decades to the region, comprising warplanes, thousands of troops, helicopters and the world's largest warship. It has carried out dozens of strikes on alleged small drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 110 people. Any doubts that remained that those operations were at least in part about regime change too have now been dashed by today's actions. What remains deeply unclear is what comes next inside Venezuela itself. The US would clearly like the Venezuelan opposition, who it is allied with, to take power – potentially either led by opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, or the opposition candidate from the 2024 elections Edmundo Gonzalez. However, even some strong critics of Maduro warn this would not be simple given the government's grip on power in the country. It controls the judiciary, the Supreme Court, the military – and is aligned with powerfully armed paramilitaries known as \"colectivos\".\n\nAFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:29:50 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T16:34:53.066213"}

A school friend was a fan of the British-designed toys and told her all about them. But she only fell in love with the brand when she saw a gingerbread house plushie on the Chinese social media app RedNote. Christmas is not widely celebrated in China and is more of a commercial event than anything more traditional. \"The festival doesn't mean a lot to me... But I always like the sight of gingerbread houses,\" she says. It was then that she asked her friend in their hometown Guangzhou to buy it for her. That was in 2021, just as Jellycat was about to make it big in China and around the world. \"Everyone felt jittery, and no-one knew what would happen,\" says Stella, who has developed a habit of petting and squeezing her plushies since Covid. She had to spend a lot of time at her home, in Beijing, which had some of the strictest lockdowns in China, if not the world. Now 32, Stella has a new job, as a sales manager in the tourism industry, but is still buying Jellycats. Her collection has grown to 120 toys, costing a total of about 36,000 yuan ($5,145; £3,815). \"At my age, there are many things you can't share with others... and the troubles we face are a lot more complicated than before,\" she says with a sigh. \"The plushies help me regulate my emotions.\" Originally aimed at children, the squishy toys have become a global hit, especially in China where a disenchanted youth has been turning to them for comfort.\n\nThe kidults\n\nStella's Gingerbread house plushie is an \"Amuseable\", a line of toys with tiny faces modelled on inanimate objects from toilet rolls to boiled eggs. The plushies are the \"breakout products\" which \"appeal to a wide Gen-Z and millennial audience\" around the world, says Kasia Davies of global analysis firm Statista. The popularity of these toys \"may have something to do with wanting to feel companiable\", Isabel Galleymore of the University of Birmingham, in the UK, says. It is difficult to say for sure whether Jellycat started the now-iconic Amuseable line, which was launched in 2018, to tap into the young adult market. But toy manufacturers need to find a new market given the falling birth rate in much of the world, Ms Davies adds. And as early as in 2015, Jellycat entered the Chinese market. Having done the \"groundwork\", the toy maker was able to capture \"the tone of the pandemic\" – when people sought comfort amid heightened uncertainty – and built on its success in China, says Kathryn Read, a business consultant with 15 years' experience in China. Jellycat's popularity was further propelled by its pop-up experiences. The in-store events offer a menu of limited-edition \"food\". Many fans film themselves being served and post the clips on social media. Localisation has also been a core strategy for the Jellycat experience. Fans could buy stuffed toy versions of items like fish, chips and mushy peas at a temporary shop at the department store Selfridges in London.\n\nMeanwhile, teapot and teacup plushies were among the items sold at special outlets in Beijing and Shanghai last year. In 2024, the UK-based firm's revenue rose by two-thirds to £333m ($459m), according to its most recent Companies House accounts. In the same period, it sold about $117m worth of toys to Chinese consumers on major e-commerce platforms, according to estimates by Beijing-based Moojing Market Intelligence. The company's growing popularity mirrors a wider boom in China's collectable-toy market among young adults seeking emotional comfort and connection. Overall sales of collectable toys in China are expected to top 110bn yuan this year, according to a 2024 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the China Animation Association. The runaway success of Labubu, the elf-like dolls created by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, highlights the country's growing appetite for collectable toys, especially among young people. This \"kidult\" trend is not unique to China, as young adults around the world question \"outdated understandings of adulthood\", says Prof Erica Kanesaka, a cultural expert at Emory University in the US. Global toy sales fell in 2024 - albeit by less than 1% - but collectable toy sales rose by almost 5%, to a record high, according to market research company Circana.\n\nCFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images Jellycat had pop-up stores in Shanghai and Beijing\n\nJellycat In September, Jellycat partnered with A-list actress Yang Mi during a pop-up event in Shanghai\n\nAmuseables, especially the aubergine, which Chinese fans call \"the boss\", have also spawned memes, with many sharing frustrations about adult life. \"Aubergine boss\" is a hashtag on RedNote, where fans draw different expressions on the plushie. In these memes, the aubergine appears in various moods from drinking to fake-smiling. For example, Wendy Hui from Hong Kong modified her aubergine Amuseable by drawing dark circles around its eyes and putting a pair of glasses on it. She then posted a picture of it on Threads with the caption: \"The mental state of workers on Monday.\" \"I kept working at home even when I was supposed to be off,\" the 30-something marketing professional says. \"I just wanted to express how exhausted I was.\" Jellycat has become an unexpected, light-hearted outlet for young Chinese people to air their grievances about a slowing economy, where hard work doesn't guarantee comparable rewards. Despite heavy censorship, the internet has remained an important, if not the only, space for such conversations.\n\nThe brand also often launches limited-edition products and retires designs. The strategy, which many in China call \"hunger marketing\", has also helped make Jellycat toys a favourite on social media in the country. Collecting can feel like a treasure hunt, with fans combing department stores and independent shops for Jellycats when they travel overseas. Some resort to \"daigou\", overseas-based shopping agents. And rare Jellycats, a status symbol among some fans, change hands for more than $1,400. But most are cheap pick-me-ups amid a sluggish economy plagued by a property crisis and high local government debt. China's youth unemployment rate has eased a little after hitting a record high in August, but official figures show it is still above 17%. \"You have to consider for a long time before buying a luxury bag,\" 34-year-old medical sales representative Jessie Chen says. \"But you don't need to do that for a Jellycat. \"Jellycat also sells bags, which cost just a few hundred yuan [tens of US dollars].

A small team, including one source within the Venezuelan government, had been observing where the 63-year-old slept, what he ate, what he wore and even, according to top military officials, \"his pets\". Then, in early December, a planned mission dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" was finalised. It was the result of months of meticulous planning and rehearsals, which even included elite US troops creating an exact full-size replica of Maduro's Caracas safe house to practise their entry routes. The plan - which amounted to an extraordinary US military intervention in Latin America not seen since the Cold War - was closely guarded. Congress was not informed or consulted ahead of time. With the precise details set, top military officials simply had to wait for the optimal conditions to launch. They wanted to maximise the element of surprise, officials said on Saturday. There was a false start four days earlier when President Trump gave approval but they opted to wait for better weather and less cloud cover. \"Over the weeks through Christmas and New Year, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action,\" General Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, told a news conference on Saturday morning.\n\n'Good luck and Godspeed'\n\nThe order from the president to begin the mission finally came at 22:46 EDT on Friday. \"We were going to do this four days ago, three days ago, two days ago, and then all of a sudden it opened up. And we said: Go,\" Trump himself told Fox & Friends on Saturday in the hours after the overnight raid. \"He said to us, and we appreciate it… good luck and Godspeed,\" Gen Caine said. Trump's order came shortly before midnight in Caracas, giving the military most of the night to operate in darkness. What followed was a two-hour and twenty-minute mission by air, land and sea that stunned many in Washington and around the world. In terms of scale and precision, it was virtually unprecedented. And it drew immediate condemnation from several regional powers, with Brazil's President Lula da Silva saying the violent capture of Venezuela's leader set \"yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community\".\n\nTrump did not follow the mission from the White House situation room. Instead, he was surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he watched a live stream of the operation flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"It was an incredible thing to see,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally like I was watching a television show. And if you would've seen the speed, the violence… it's just, it was an amazing thing, an amazing job that these people did.\"\n\nDonald Trump / TruthSocial Trump watched a live stream of the operation from his Florida estate\n\nIn recent months, thousands of US troops have deployed to the region, joining an aircraft carrier and dozens of warships in the largest military build-up in decades as President Trump has accused Maduro of drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism, and blown up dozens of small boats accused of ferrying drugs through the region. But the first signs of Operation Absolute Resolve were in the skies. More than 150 aircraft - including bombers, fighter jets and reconnaissance planes - were ultimately deployed through the course of the night, according to US officials. \"It was very complex, extremely complex, the whole manoeuvre, the landings, the number of aircraft,\" Trump told Fox News. \"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation.\" Loud explosions were heard in Caracas at about 02:00 local time, and plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. \"I heard a huge sound, a loud bang,\" reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero told the BBC. \"It moved all the windows. Immediately after I saw a huge cloud of smoke that almost blocked the entire view.\" \"Planes and helicopters were flying all over the city,\" she said.\n\nWatch: Smoke, bangs and helicopters in Caracas\n\nSoon videos showing numerous aircraft in the skies - and others showing the apparent aftermath of explosions - began to circulate widely on social media. One showed a convoy of helicopters flying at low altitude over Caracas as smoke rose from apparent detonations. \"We woke up at around 01:55 to the roar of explosions and the hum of planes flying over Caracas,\" one witness. Daniela, told the BBC. \"Everything was plunged into absolute darkness, illuminated only by the flashes of nearby detonations.\" \"Neighbours were messaging in the condominium group chat, all confused and unaware of what was happening [and] frightened by the blasts,\" she said. BBC Verify has examined a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted. So far, it has confirmed five locations including Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La Carlota and Port La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea.\n\nSome of the US strikes targeted air defence systems and other military targets, officials said. Trump also suggested the US cut the power in Caracas before the mission began, although he did not specify how. \"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,\" he said. \"It was dark and it was deadly.\"\n\n'They knew we were coming'\n\nAs strikes rang out around Caracas, US forces made their way into the city. They included members of the elite Delta Force, the US military's top special mission unit, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS. They were heavily armed - and carried a blowtorch in case they had to cut through the metal doors of Maduro's safe house. The troops arrived at Maduro's location shortly after the strikes began at 02:01 local time, according to Gen Caine. Trump described the safe house as a heavily fortified military \"fortress\" in the heart of Caracas. \"They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming,\" he said. The troops took fire when they arrived, and one of the American helicopters was hit but was still able to fly. \"The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline,\" Gen Caine said. \"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,\" Trump said. It was only as the operation - which also saw Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, seized - was unfolding that Secretary of State Rubio began notifying lawmakers about the action, a decision which has since prompted anger from some in Congress. \"Let me be clear: Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate dictator. But launching military action without congressional authorisation and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless,\" said top Democrat Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate. Briefing Congress ahead of time would have endangered the mission, Rubio told reporters during the news conference on Saturday. \"Congress has a tendency to leak,\" Trump added. \"This would not be good.\"\n\nGetty Images The US struck several locations around Caracas, including Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 23:42:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T02:35:17.481705"}

People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation. Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she is grateful to the US for \"taking Maduro out of here\" because now, she \"at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again\". But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name.\n\nJorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be \"well-supported by Trump and the entire United States\", he fears the coming days will not be easy. \"Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?\" Jorge told the BBC. \"It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\" Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". Early Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. As Maduro and his wife are extradited to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking. But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC. Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. \"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said of Trump. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\" The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, is that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country.\n\nVenezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 01:23:56 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T02:35:17.628088"}

US oil companies would also fix Venezuela's \"broken infrastructure\" and \"start making money for the country\", the US president said. The US launched strikes on Venezuela on Saturday morning in which Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were captured by US forces and removed from the country. Venezuela announced a state of national emergency and denounced the \"military aggression\", with the country's vice president saying Maduro is its only leader.\n\nMaduro and Flores were flown out of the capital, Caracas, on a US helicopter in the early hours of Saturday morning and taken aboard the USS Iwo Jima at an unknown location in the Caribbean Sea. They were later flown to the Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base in Cuba before being transferred to another plane to head to New York state, and then flown by helicopter into New York City's Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and Flores had been indicted in the Southern District of New York. The pair have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi wrote on X. Previously, Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.\n\nTrump told a news conference ahead of Maduro's arrival in New York: \"The oil business in Venezuela has been a bust, a total bust for a long period of time. \"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\" The South American country has approximately 303 billion barrels' worth of crude, accounting for about 20% of the world's oil resources, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: \"We are going to run the country\"\n\nIt is unclear exactly how the US plans to \"run\" Venezuela, but the president said it will be a \"group\" of people leading the charge. \"We're going to be running it with a group, and we're going to make sure it's run properly,\" Trump said. When pressed by reporters as to who inside Venezuela would form part of that group, Trump said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been talking to Delcy Rodríguez, the country's vice-president. Trump said Rodríguez - who has since been named interim president by Venezuela's Supreme Court - had expressed her willingness to do \"whatever the US asks\". However, speaking on state TV after Trump's remarks, Rodríguez called Maduro the \"only one president in Venezuela\", adding that the government was ready to defend itself. Trump also said he had not spoken to Venezuela's opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who was barred from last year's presidential election but was instrumental in galvanising support for a rival candidate to Maduro believed to have won the poll. The US president said Machado \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country\" needed to run Venezuela. Explosions were heard around Caracas early on Saturday morning as military bases were targeted by US forces. Over the following two hours and twenty minutes, dozens of US aircraft were seen in the skies as special forces penetrated Maduro's safe house to retrieve him.

Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\" that was \"deeply concerning and condemnable\". China's foreign ministry said it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Many Latin American countries, including Venezuela's neighbours, Colombia and Brazil, also condemned the actions. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel described them as a \"criminal attack\", while Trump's ally in Argentina, Javier Milei, wrote \"freedom moves forward\" on social media. US allies were more reserved in their responses, urging a peaceful transition of power. Sir Keir Starmer said the UK \"regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president\" and \"shed no tears about the end of his regime\", but called for a \"safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government\". The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas and France's president Emmanuel Macron offered similar sentiments calls for peace. A new government must be \"respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\", Macron wrote in a post on X.

On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will \"run\" Venezuela. The US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him \"we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice\". Trump was light on detail. He said that \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]\". But does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance? It sounded as if he believes something like that. The evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth. The respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela. The same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power. The removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power. The US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life.\n\nMaduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens. But the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders. The mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces. The military operation is only the first stage. America's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous. The political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process. Iraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021. Neither country was in America's backyard. Yet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising. Trump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. \"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\" He said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to \"watch his ass\". Later he told Fox News that \"something's going to have to be done with Mexico\". Cuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans. The US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America. I was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs. Donald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country. \"I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect.\" He did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections. Instead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. While there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact. It is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans. The military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose. Civilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups. They include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary.\n\nWatch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded\n\nThe US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview. He makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries. He has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance. Trump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised. \"We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement.\" That will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south. The US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:14:35 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T15:43:50.372523"}

Regional security and Beijing's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture are also on the agenda for Monday's meeting, which is their second summit since November, when Xi visited South Korea. Given what a vital economic partner China is, experts say Lee is looking for assurances that it would not weaponise that relationship in the face of political tensions in the region. For weeks, China and Japan have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the former's claim on self-governed Taiwan, which puts Seoul, a key regional power, in an awkward spot.\n\nBeijing ramped up the rhetoric against Japan after its prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self defence force in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. So visiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee. Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence. Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will attend a banquet hosted by Xi on Monday. He will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai. Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\". This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China. On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC. \"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\" Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan. While Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park added. Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi.

His comments to US magazine The Atlantic came as the country's deposed president Nicolás Maduro was set to appear in a New York court on Monday. The US accuses Maduro, who is charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences, of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime, a claim he denies. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted the US is not at war with Venezuela, after air strikes in Caracas on Saturday led to Maduro and his wife being taken into custody and transported to the US.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers said the operation was an \"act of war\". In an interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, Trump said of Rodríguez: \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\" He added that for Venezuela,\"Regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can't get any worse\".\n\nDonald Trump Trump posted a picture of Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima after his arrest\n\nOn Saturday, Trump had vowed the US would \"run\" the country until \"a safe and proper and judicious transition\" was possible. Trump also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country\". Despite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge. The Cuban government has said 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" died when US forces attacked and captured Maduro and his wife. Cuba - a longstanding socialist ally of Maduro - has announced two days of national mourning.\n\nIn several TV interviews on Sunday morning, Rubio defended the US's military operation in Venezuela, stressing the action did not mean the US is at war with the South American country. \"We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That's not a war against Venezuela,\" Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning. The secretary of state also told CBS that if Venezuela doesn't \"make the right decisions\", the US \"will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected\". That includes the \"quarantine\" the US has placed on Venezuela's oil, he said. \"We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do,\" he added. Trump also threatened Venezuela's neighbour Colombia, in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One. He did not rule out military action against Colombia, saying \"it sounds good to me\", and called Colombian President Gustavo Petro \"a sick man\". \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump said.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Armed police officers stand in front of the Metropolitan Detention facility in the Brooklyn borough of New York, where ousted president Nicolás Maduro is being held.\n\nMaduro, who leads the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at their compound and flown to the US, as part of a dramatic special forces operation in the early hours of Saturday that also saw strikes on military bases. The couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday. Maduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil. While US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team and \"soldiers and innocent civilians\" were killed in the US operation. When asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it \"wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion\". He described it as a \"law enforcement operation\", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents. You can't notify Congress of an operation like this because \"it will leak\", he added. Maduro's vice president Delcy Rodríguez is now the interim president after being sworn in by the nation's Supreme Court. The country's military has also given its backing to her. She will be sworn in as president on Monday in Caracas, at 08:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Speaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela. He answered that \"this is not about the legitimate president\" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas on Saturday", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:11:21 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T04:11:00.992165"}

He's followed through on threats against Venezuela by capturing its president and his wife from their heavily fortified Caracas compound in a dramatic overnight raid. When describing the operation, Trump dusted off the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the western hemisphere - re-branding it the \"Donroe Doctrine\". Here are some of the warnings he's made against other nations in Washington's orbit in recent days.\n\nGreenland\n\nThe US already has a military base on Greenland - Pituffik Space Base - but Trump wants the whole island. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security\", he told journalists, saying the region was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\" The vast Arctic island, part of the Kingdom of Denmark, sits roughly 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to the north-east of the US. It's rich in rare earth minerals, which are crucial for the production of smart phones, electric vehicles and military hardware. Currently, China's production of rare earths far outweighs that of the US. Greenland also occupies a key strategic location in the North Atlantic, giving access to the increasingly important Arctic circle. As polar ices melt in the coming years, new shipping routes are expected to open up. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded to Trump by describing the notion of US control over the island as a \"fantasy\". \"No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation. We are open to dialogue. We are open to discussions. But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law,\" he said.\n\nColombia\n\nJust hours after the operation in Venezuela, Trump warned Colombian President Gustavo Petro to \"watch his ass\". Venezuela's neighbour to the west, Colombia is home to substantial oil reserves and is a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. It is also a key hub for the region's drug trade - most notably cocaine. Since the US began striking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific in September - saying, without evidence, they were carrying drugs - Trump has been locked in a spiralling dispute with the country's left-wing president. The US imposed sanctions on Petro in October, saying he was allowing cartels to \"flourish\". Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said Colombia was being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States\". \"He's not going to be doing it for very long\", he said. Asked whether the US would carry out an operation targeting Colombia, Trump replied, \"It sounds good to me\". Historically, Colombia has been a close ally in Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter cartels.\n\nIran\n\nIran is currently facing mass anti-government protests, and Trump warned overnight that the authorities there would be \"hit very hard\" if more protesters died. \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States,\" he told reporters on Air Force One. Iran theoretically falls outside the scope defined in the \"Donroe Doctrine\", but Trump has nonetheless previously threatened the Iranian regime with further action, after striking its nuclear facilities last year. Those strikes came after Israel launched a large-scale operation aimed at decapitating Iran's capability to develop a nuclear weapon, which culminated in the 12-day Israel-Iran conflict. In a Mar-a-Lago meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, Iran was said to be top of the agenda. US media also reported that Netanyahu raised the potential of new strikes against Iran in 2026.\n\nMexico\n\nTrump's rise to power in 2016 was defined by his calls to \"Build the Wall\" along the southern border with Mexico. On his first day back in office in 2025, he signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\". He has frequently claimed Mexican authorities aren't doing enough to stop the flow of drugs or illegal immigrants into the US. Speaking on Sunday, he said that drugs were \"pouring\" through Mexico and \"we're gonna have to do something\", adding that the cartels there were \"very strong.\" Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected any US military action on Mexican soil.\n\nCuba", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 04:19:13 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T07:31:59.445714"}

The two nations have shared a political vision of state-led socialism since a fresh-faced Venezuelan presidential candidate, Hugo Chávez, met the aged leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, on the tarmac at Havana airport in 1999. For years, their mutual ties only deepened, as Venezuelan crude oil flowed to the communist-run island in exchange for Cuban doctors and medics travelling in the other direction. After the deaths of the two men, it was Nicolás Maduro - trained and instructed in Cuba - who became Chávez's handpicked successor, chosen partly because he was acceptable to the Castro brothers. He represented continuity for the Cuban revolution as much as the Venezuelan one. Now he, too, is gone from the seat of power in Caracas, forcibly removed by the US's elite Delta Force team. The prospects for Cuba in his absence are bleak. For now, the Cuban government has robustly denounced the attack as illegal and declared two days of national mourning for 32 Cuban nationals killed in the US military operation. Their deaths revealed a key fact long-known about Cuban influence over the Venezuelan presidency and military: Maduro's security detail was almost entirely made up of Cuban bodyguards. Cuban nationals are in place in numerous positions in Venezuela's intelligence services and military too. Cuba had long denied having active soldiers or security agents inside Venezuela, but freed political prisoners have often claimed they were interrogated by men with Cuban accents while in custody. Furthermore, despite endless public proclamations of solidarity between the two nations, in truth the Cuban influence behind the scenes of the Venezuelan state is believed to have driven a wedge between ministers most closely aligned with Havana and those who feel that the relationship first established by Chávez and Castro has become fundamentally unbalanced. In essence, that faction considers that these days Venezuela gets little in return for its oil. Venezuela is believed to send around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba - none of the island's other main energy partners, Russia and Mexico, even come close.\n\nGetty Images Food shortages have worsened in Cuba as it grapples with a severe economic crisis\n\nThe Trump administration's tactic of confiscating sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers has already begun to worsen the fuel and electricity crisis in Cuba and has the potential to become very acute, very quickly. At best, the future looks increasingly complex for the beleaguered Caribbean island without Maduro at the helm in Caracas. Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War. There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months. And the impact on ordinary Cubans has been taxing in the extreme: weeks without reliable electricity, food rotting in fridges, fans and air-conditioning not running, mosquitoes swarming in the heat and the fester of uncollected rubbish. The island has experienced a widespread outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in recent weeks with huge numbers of people affected by dengue fever and chikungunya. Cuba's healthcare system, once the jewel in the revolution's crown, has struggled to cope. It is not a pretty picture. Yet it is the daily reality for most Cubans. The idea that the flow of Venezuelan oil to Cuba could be turned off by Delcy Rodríguez fills Cubans with dread, especially if she looks to placate the Trump administration following the US raid against her predecessor and stave off the spectre of more violence.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock\n\nPresident Trump insists Washington is calling the shots in Venezuela now. While those comments were walked back - to an extent - by his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, there is no doubt that the Trump administration now expects nothing less than total compliance from Rodríguez as acting president. There would be further, potentially worse consequences, Trump threatened, if she \"doesn't behave\", as he put it. Such language - not to mention the US operation in Venezuela itself - has shocked and angered Washington's critics, who say the White House is guilty of the worst form of US imperialism and interventionism seen in Latin America since the Cold War. The removal of Maduro from power amounted to kidnapping, those critics argue, and the case against him must be thrown out at his eventual trial in New York.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:41:36 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T08:39:19.221337"}

The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies. The batches were sold across the world, Nestle said, and they potentially contain cereulide, which can cause nausea and vomiting when consumed.

Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are taking part, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed. However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging.\n\nThe outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter. Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting.

Trump told NBC News that \"a tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they'll get reimbursed by us or through revenue\". Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration later this week, BBC's partner CBS News reported. Analysts previously told the BBC it could take tens of billions of dollars, and potentially a decade, to restore Venezuela's former output.\n\nTrump's remarks came days after he said the US would \"run\" Venezuela after the ousting of Maduro - who has now been brought to the US to face criminal charges. Speaking to NBC about his 18-month timeframe, Trump speculated that oil production could ramp up \"in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money\". He has been explicit about his ambitions for American petroleum companies to scale up their operations in the country. \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down,\" Trump added. The analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil. They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place, and even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years.\n\nTrump has claimed in recent days that American oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The country has an estimated 303 million barrels, the world's largest proven reserve. But it produces just a fraction of that amount, and its production has been in decline since the early 2000s. The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves. Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms. Additionally, Venezuelan oil is heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently working in the country. Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company \"remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets\". \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,\" Turenne added. Other major US energy companies Exxon and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and stole American oil\". Vice President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that \"Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities\". The reality is more complex. US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements. Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country. In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for this 2007 move. That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it. But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has \"stolen\" American oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:40:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:03:09.610652"}

Asked in an interview with CNN to confirm the US would rule out the use of force to annex the semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark, Stephen Miller said, \"nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\" On Sunday Trump repeated his insistence that the US \"needs\" Greenland - to the consternation of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who said an attack by the US would spell the end of Nato. Six European allies rallied to Denmark's support with a joint statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" read the statement by the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark. Stressing they were as keen as the US in Arctic security, the seven signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US \"collectively\" - whilst \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\". In his interview with CNN, Miller said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\". He went on: \"By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? What is their basis of claiming Greenland as a colony of Denmark?\" The top Trump aide also said the US \"is the power of Nato. For the US to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend Nato and Nato interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the US.\" Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks.\n\nThe issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time. He also said the US was returning to an 1823 policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere - and he warned a number of countries the US could turn its attention to them. In the wake of the Venezuela intervention, Miller's wife Katie posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word \"SOON\".\n\nIt has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic - something the US president has previously refused to rule out. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark. Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:38:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:03:09.791199"}

The BBC's analysis of protests includes only those for which we have verified video footage - the true number is almost certainly far higher. There are reports of protests in a further 11 provinces. The wave of protests has spread rapidly across Iran since 28 December, when anger initially broke out in the capital Tehran following a fresh and sharp devaluation of the country's currency against the dollar and other major foreign currencies. Verified footage from the last 10 days shows evidence of anti-government demonstrations and gatherings in more than 50 towns and cities across the country, including in several regions previously perceived as being highly loyal to the state.\n\nMore than 100 videos which which we geolocated and checked for publication date paint a picture of the scale of the unrest, with people taking to the streets in many major cities in Iran and presenting the largest challenge to the state since the Women, Life and Freedom protests in 2022. Footage has also shown protests in Qom in central Iran and Mashhad in the north-east, both of which have traditionally hosted populations extremely loyal to the Islamic Republic. Prof Sina Azodi, Director of Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University, said that unrest in those cities was \"very telling\" and amounted to evidence that the government's \"base of support is also suffering under the economic hardship\".\n\nAuthorities have traditionally used violence to crush unrest. During the 2022 protests - sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who had been detained in Tehran for wearing \"improper hijab\" - more than 550 people were allegedly killed by security forces, according to human rights groups. While the latest response by police and security forces initially appeared to be more restrained, verified footage has shown officers ramping up the use of force since Saturday. This change in approach coincided with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's first public reaction to the protests on that day, in which he said that \"rioters must be put in their place\". Since the supreme leader's remarks, Iran's judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said authorities would \"listen to protesters and critics who legitimately and rightly have concerns about their livelihood and social and economic welfare\". But he added that they would \"deal firmly with those who seek to exploit the situation, incite riots, and undermine the security of the country and the people\". The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has also issued warnings to protesters in Lorestan province that they will no longer tolerate street gatherings. BBC Persian has so far confirmed the identities of at least 11 people reported dead since 28 December using a combination of verified funeral videos and interviews with family members and friends. Foreign-based human rights group HRANA says at least 35 people have so far been killed in the unrest, including two affiliated with security forces.\n\nOne of the most violent crackdowns happened in Malekshahi, a small town in the western province of Ilam, on Saturday. Verified footage showed a small demonstration taking place at Commandery Boulevard, where the officers of several state institutions are located, before gunfire appeared to break out. Human rights groups said four people were killed in the incident, with the semi-official Mehr and Tasnim news agencies putting the figure at three dead. Later footage showed a number of people being transported to hospital. It was unclear from the footage what condition those seen in the footage were in.

Iran's president has ordered an investigation into the incident. Experts warned that the security forces heavy-handed response could exacerbate the challenges facing the government. \"Escalating repression is likely to deepen popular resentment toward the political system while risking fatigue and demoralisation within the police and security forces - who, at some point, may cease to comply with orders,\" Peyman Jafari, assistant professor of international relations at the US-based College of William and Mary, told BBC Verify.

Another dramatic clip showed a security officer on a motorbike set ablaze by a demonstrator wielding an improvised flamethrower after security forces violently detained and beat up a protester. It is unclear what happened to the officer, as the footage cut off, while other officers gave chase to the demonstrator who fled on foot.

Officials have also been accused of widespread corruption. But in recent days the demonstrations have taken an anti-state tone, with protesters in numerous locations chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the clerical establishment that has been ruling the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Verified videos have also shown chants in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the Shah of Iran, and the pre-1979 revolution Pahlavi dynasty. At the University of Tehran, some protesters chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Khamenei - as dozens of demonstrators flooded through the institution's main gate on 30 December.

After all, last June he co-ordinated the daring \"Spider Web\" attack, which saw more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russian territory. Khmara, his replacement, was also involved in the preparation of that operation.\n\nSo it did not come as a surprise that Malyuk's dismissal earlier this week was widely criticised within Ukraine, including by several high-profile military commanders. The impression that the decision made by President Zelensky was short-sighted was cemented by reports that Malyuk had initially refused to step down voluntarily.\n\nAlthough he has been dismissed from the position of SBU chief, he has been asked to continue leading special operations against Russia. Ukraine needed more \"asymmetric operations against Russian forces\", Zelensky said, adding that Malyuk was \"best at this\".\n\nKhmara's appointment has gone some way in quelling fears about the SBU's future effectiveness. But former SBU operative Ivan Stupak argues his reputation - though solid - is limited to a certain sphere and that it is unclear whether he will be able to translate his experience to running the wider SBU.\n\nStupak also believes that Malyuk's dismissal is connected with the appointment of former spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as Zelensky's new chief of staff.\n\n\"Malyuk and Budanov are at loggerheads,\" he told the BBC, implying that Budanov had heavily influenced Zelensky's decision and that Khmara would now be \"in the hands\" of Budanov.\n\nOther analysts disagree. Oleksandr Notevskyi, of the Ukrainian Center for Policy Development, praised Khmara's appointment, pointing out his successes in heading Alpha, one of the top elite divisions of the SBU: \"He's young, he's experienced, he is one of the authors of the Spider Web operation.\"\n\nIn a statement, the SBU described Khmara as a decorated and \"experienced special-purpose officer\" who was involved in liberating the Kyiv region in 2022 and fighting the Russians in the occupied region of Donetsk.\n\nKhmara's appointment will need to be confirmed by the Ukrainian parliament, which may yet reject it. Other options are on the table, Notevskyi said.\n\nAfter nearly four years of war, Ukraine is struggling to push back Russian forces in the conventional way - on the battlefield and along the long front line in the east of the country. It has had more success targeting oil fields, weapons factories and - as in the case of the Spider Web attack - air bases and valuable aircraft.\n\nAt this particular juncture of the war with Moscow, Notevskyi argued, \"whoever leads the security service should be someone who is specialised in eliminating Russia's military capacities on the territory of Russia\".\n\nLast week, Zelensky announced significant changes to his top team. Mikhaylo Fedorov was nominated as new defence minister, while foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko replaced Budanov.\n\nMany of Zelensky's reshuffles have been criticised by commentators as damaging to the country at a time of crisis.\n\nUsing a football analogy, Stupak argued that Zelensky was like a manager going to the substitute bench for replacements. \"But his bench is quite short, and he's running out of people to use again and again,\" he said.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:26:46 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T14:53:37.619188"}

The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would \"run\" Venezuela.\n\nThe union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas. At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service. They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta. The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. The union called the incidents \"alarming\" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country.\n\nThe repression has not been confined to media workers. One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were \"hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses\". Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as \"colectivos\", wearing masks. A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was \"so much fear in the streets and in our homes\".

Two US officials told the broadcaster that American forces plan to intercept the ship, which historically has carried Venezuelan crude oil and is thought to be between Scotland and Iceland. President Donald Trump said last month that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, a move the government there described as \"theft\". Ahead of his seizure of the country's former leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Trump had repeatedly accused Venezuela's government of using ships to bring drugs to American shores.\n\nThe US coastguard tried to board the Bella 1 last month in the Caribbean when it was believed to be heading towards Venezuela. They had obtained a warrant to seize the ship, accused of breaking US sanctions and shipping Iranian oil. It then dramatically changed course, as well as its name to the Marinera, reportedly reflagging from a Guyanan to a Russian vessel. Its approach to Europe has coincided with the arrival of around 10 US military transport aircraft in the UK as well as helicopters. Russia says it is \"monitoring with concern\" the situation around the ship. CBS News reported that the two US officials said American forces preferred to seize the ship rather than sink it. The Marinera is believed to be between Scotland and Iceland, with the distance and weather making a boarding difficult. If any US military operation were to be launched from the UK then Washington would be expected to inform its ally. For now the UK Ministry of Defence says it will not comment on other nations' military activities.

The White House told the BBC that acquiring Greenland - a semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark – was a \"national security priority\". The statement came hours after European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark, which has been pushing back against Trump's ambitions for the Arctic island. Trump repeated over the weekend that the US \"needed\" Greenland for security reasons, prompting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to warn that any attack by the US would spell the end of Nato.\n\nThe White House said on Tuesday: \"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal.\" Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks. On Tuesday, six European allies expressed support for Denmark. \"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark said in a joint statement. Stressing they were as keen as the US in Arctic security, the European signatories of the joint statement said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US \"collectively\". They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".\n\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen welcomed the statement and called for \"respectful dialogue\". \"The dialogue must take place with respect for the fact that Greenland's status is rooted in international law and the principle of territorial integrity,\" Nielsen said. The issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. A day after that raid, Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides - posted a map on social media of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word \"SOON\". On Monday, her husband, Stephen Miller, said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\". Asked repeatedly in an interview with CNN whether America would rule out using force to annex it, Miller responded: \"Nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\"\n\nAn unnamed US senior official told Reuters news agency that the American options included the outright purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory. In response, a state department spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday that the US \"is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland\". \"Our common adversaries have been increasingly active in the Arctic. That is a concern that the United States, the Kingdom of Denmark, and NATO Allies share,\" the spokesperson said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also told lawmakers at a classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Monday that the Trump administration did not plan to invade Greenland, but mentioned buying it from Denmark, the Wall Street Journal reports. Greenland and Denmark previously said they had asked to meet Rubio quickly to discuss the American claims on the island. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said speaking with America's top diplomat should resolve \"certain misunderstandings\". Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, emphasised the national security aspect when he spoke to the BBC on Tuesday. \"I think they're just in talks right now,\" he said. \"My hope is that Europe would understand that a strong America is good - it's good for Western civilisation.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Schmitt to the BBC: It's \"important\" US moves forward with acquiring Greenland\n\nTrump floated his idea of acquiring Greenland as a strategic US hub in the Arctic during his first presidential term, saying in 2019: \"Essentially it's a large real estate deal.\" There is growing interest from Russia and China in the island, which has untapped rare earth deposits, as melting ice raises the possibility of new trade routes. In March, Trump said America would \"go as far as we have to go\" to get control of the territory.

There has been no comment from either Col Damiba or Ivory Coast.\n\nSince seizing power, Capt Traoré has faced at least two coup attempts and is also grappling with growing jihadist violence that has forced millions from their homes. Despite these challenges and his authoritarian reputation, the 37-year-old military leader maintains strong popular support and has gained a following across the continent for his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence.\n\nAccording to the security minister, the authorities uncovered a leaked video showing the plotters discussing their plans. In the footage they allegedly spoke about how they intended to assassinate the president - either at close range or by planting explosives at his residence - just after 23:00 local time on Saturday 3 January. Afterwards they allegedly planned to target other senior military and civilian figures. Sana alleged that Damiba had mobilised both soldiers and civilian supporters, secured foreign funding - most significantly 70m CFA francs ($125,000; £92,000) delivered from Ivory Coast - and planned to knock out the country's drone-launch base before foreign forces could intervene. \"We are carrying out ongoing investigations and have made several arrests. These individuals will be brought to justice soon,\" the minister said on national television. Sana insisted the situation was under control and urged citizens \"not to be misled, out of naivety, into dangerous schemes\". It is not clear how many people have been arrested. Critics, both local and foreign, have accused Traoré of authoritarianism and say his government suppresses dissent - including arbitrary arrests of military officers and restrictions on the media. It is not the first time the junta has pointed the finger of blame about foreign interference in its affairs at Ivory Coast. These continuing internal power struggles will further heighten regional tensions. Col Damiba served as Burkina Faso's leader from January-September 2022 after seizing power from an elected government. After being ousted, he said in a message published on social media that he wished his successor every success.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:17:56 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T11:29:26.019008"}

The presidential honour guard is the military force which provides the bodyguards tasked with protecting the head of state. While the Venezuelan government has not yet provided a detailed breakdown of casualties, members of the guard are thought to be among the dozens of people killed in the US operation to seize Maduro. The order to replace Gen Marcano Tábata was issued by the new interim president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nRodríguez was sworn in by the National Assembly, which is dominated by government loyalists, on Monday. She served as Maduro's vice-president and is considered to be a close ally of the jailed leader. US President Donald Trump said in the news conference following Maduro's seizure that the United States would \"run\" Venezuela and that the US was talking to Rodríguez. He also threatened that Rodríguez would face a \"fate worse than Maduro's\" if she did not comply with US demands, including those for oil, of which Venezuela has the world's largest proven reserves. On Tuesday, the US president said that Venezuela would be \"turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, but Venezuela's interim government has yet to comment on that statement. Rodríguez's tone has been alternating between defiant and conciliatory since she was designated interim president by Venezuela's Supreme Court. She denounced the seizure of Maduro as an \"illegal kidnapping\" but has also said that her government had \"invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation\". Her actions are being watched closely both inside and outside of Venezuela to gauge what course she may steer now that she is in charge of the country and for signs of any potential rifts in her government.\n\nThe sacking of Gen Marcano Tábata is one of the first changes to senior officials in her inner circle. As well as being in charge of the presidential guard, Gen Marcano Tábata also led Venezuela's military counterintelligence unit DGCIM. The DGCIM has played a key role in the repression of people critical of the Maduro government, according to the United Nations. A UN Independent Fact-Finding Mission found that the counterintelligence unit had committed myriad human rights violations since 2013. It documented scores of cases in which those detained were subjected to \"torture, sexual violence and/or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\" in the DGCIM headquarters and a network of covert detention centres across the country However, his sacking does not appear to be related to the repression carried out by the DGCIM under his helm as the man she has appointed to succeed him headed an intelligence service which faces similar accusations. Gustavo González López was in charge of Venezuela's national intelligence service, Sebin for many years. The Sebin controls the notorious Helicoide prison in Caracas, where the UN documented abuses being carried out against \"opposition politicians, journalists, protesters, and human rights defenders\".\n\nVenezuelan analysts think that Gen Marcano Tábata's dismissal is more likely to be related to the failure of the presidential honour guard to prevent the seizure of Maduro. Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela which has long provided security and intelligence services to Maduro, said that 32 of its nationals had been killed in the US raid. Many of them are thought to have been embedded in the presidential honour guard.\n\nWatch: What's at the heart of Cuba and Venezuela's relationship?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:50:10 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T16:00:05.914942"}

US forces boarded the Russian-flagged Marinera after a pursuit lasting almost two weeks and as it travelled through the waters between Iceland and Scotland. The British Navy gave logistical support by air and sea. A second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was accused by the US of \"conducting illicit activities\" and boarded in the Caribbean. The moves come as the US seeks to choke off most exports of Venezuelan crude oil, and just days after its special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a lighting raid on his residence in Caracas.\n\nIn a post on X, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote: \"The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT - anywhere in the world.\" Moscow has denounced the seizure of the tanker sailing under its flag, and demanded that the US treat Russians on board properly and permits them to return to Russia quickly. The transport ministry said it had given the vessel \"temporary permission\" to use the Russian flag, adding that no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions. Reports had suggested that Russia had dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel, but it appears that US forces were able to board the tanker without facing any resistance. The White House described the ship as a \"Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel deemed stateless after flying a false flag and had a judicial order\" against it.\n\nVenezuela's leadership is co-operating with the US on the second tanker seized in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. \"They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they co-operate and work with the United States,\" Rubio told reporters. Earlier, US President Donald Trump had said that Venezuela - which has the world's largest oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US. Rubio said that the US would sell oil that is in Venezuela \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\". He said the US had a considered plan for the future of Venezuela, and that the administration was \"not just winging it\".

The White House has said it was \"actively\" discussing an offer to buy the territory that has for centuries belonged to Denmark. US President Donald Trump and his officials had earlier intimated a willingness to take it by force if necessary. This has been met with nervousness and opprobrium among Greenlanders - both on the world's largest island and elsewhere. This nervousness has only grown since the US took Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro from his residence in Caracas to New York on drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in an unprecedented military move. Almost immediately after, the wife of a senior White House staffer indicated that Greenland was next. \"That's when it stopped feeling abstract,\" says Tupaarnaq Kopeck, 40, who moved to Canada - another place Trump has threatened to annex - for family and work. \"For the first time, I contacted my sister in Greenland and told her that if the unthinkable ever became reality, they would have a place to stay with us.\" Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, says the comments from the Trump administration are \"a clear threat\" that she was \"appalled\" by. \"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she says.\n\nTupaarnaq Kopeck Tupaarnaq Kopeck says the military intervention in Venezuela made the abstract feel real\n\nGreenland is the world's most sparsely populated territory. With much of the Arctic island covered by ice, most of the population lives in Nuuk and the surrounding south-western coastline. But it is strategically significant to the US - which is why it has had a military presence there since World War 2. Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks. More recently, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. \"It's not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats - if you can call them that - from a giant like the US,\" says Masaana Egede, Editor in Chief from Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. \"The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.\" Experts generally agree that a military takeover of Greenland would be an easy undertaking for the US - but that the geopolitical fallout would effectively end the Nato alliance. After the issue of Greenland's ownership was raised anew by the White House, six European allies issued a statement saying Greenland's future should be decided by its people - something Mia says she is grateful for. But she worries this will matter little to the US \"if it's not backed with consequences and actions\". \"As a Greenlander, I can't help but wonder: what are we worth to these allies? To what lengths are they willing to go to protect us?\" Tupaarnaq says: \"Respect is about more than alliances on paper. When powerful nations talk about you instead of with you, that respect disappears very quickly.\"\n\nAleqatsiaq Peary Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter says a US takeover would just \"replace one occupier with another\"\n\nThe Trump administration has stressed its intention was to buy Greenland from Denmark - despite Copenhagen reiterating the territory was not for sale - while retaining a military intervention as an option. Aaja sees annexation by force as unlikely - instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\". Polling consistently shows that Greenlanders generally favour eventual independence from Denmark but oppose being owned by the US. The territory is largely self-governing, with control of foreign affairs and defence retained by Copenhagen. This is perhaps why Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in the remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, seemed unfazed by the prospect of US ownership. \"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he says. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\" But he says: \"I don't have time for Trump. Our people are in need,\" explaining hunters like him hunt with dogs on the sea ice and fish, \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".

Trump administration officials claim the woman, identified as Renee Nicole Good, was a \"violent rioter\" attempting to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents when one agent fired \"defensive shots\" into her vehicle. But city and state leaders, and Democrats nationally, are disputing that account. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey claims that \"this was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying\", telling ICE agents: \"Get out of our city.\"\n\nMultiple videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time. From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis. A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the sidewalk area. Multiple law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. Immigration agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, get out of the truck and order the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. It's not clear exactly where the officer is standing based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC. That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off. Three pops are heard, and the vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a white car parked along the street nearby.

The shooting comes amid a major immigration crackdown in Minneapolis by the Trump administration. US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said the deceased woman's actions constituted \"domestic terrorism\" - and that ICE's operations in the city will continue. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that an ICE officer was \"viciously\" run over. \"It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,\" he wrote. The president also blamed the \"Radical Left\" for \"threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis\". Speaking to press later in the day, Noem called the loss of life \"preventable\". But she repeatedly claimed that the ICE agent fired in self-defence and that Good used her vehicle as a \"deadly weapon\" against agents. The details are pending an FBI investigation she said, adding that the same agent injured Wednesday was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June. The Minneapolis City Council, however, said that Good was simply \"caring for her neighbors\" when she was shot and killed.\n\nGetty Images Law enforcement surrounds the area where an ICE agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis\n\nMinnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident. \"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\" Top Democrats, like former Vice President Kamala Harris and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements Wednesday evening. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events \"gaslighting\". Protests erupted in several parts of the city as outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave. According to local media reports, the main gathering happened near the scene of the shooting. A makeshift vigil, displaying flowers and candles, was laid in the snow there, as protesters chanted slogans and delivered speeches. One group of protesters formed a line blocking the entrance to a federal courthouse with ICE officers standing inside, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The group of around 50 people chanted Good's name and dispersed after breaking a glass window. Protests are also taking place in cities outside Minneapolis, with gatherings expected in New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.\n\nWhy is ICE in Minneapolis?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 02:07:47 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T03:51:11.273241"}

What is it about Delcy Rodríguez, daughter of a former Marxist guerilla and deputy to ousted dictator Nicolas Maduro, that has caught the eye of the Trump administration? And why has Washington decided on an avowed \"Chavista\" revolutionary to stay in power, rather than backing the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, whose opposition movement is widely believed to have won the 2024 presidential elections? The answer, according to one former US ambassador to Venezuela, is simple. \"They've gone for stability over democracy,\" says Charles Shapiro, who served as George W Bush's ambassador in Caracas from 2002-04. \"They've kept the dictatorial regime in place without the dictator. The henchmen are still there.\" \"I think it's risky as hell.\" But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro.\n\nWatch: \"I want a president who's involved\" - Michiganders weigh in on Maduro's seizure\n\nIn his dramatic press conference on Saturday morning, President Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as \"not respected\" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as \"gracious.\" \"I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,\" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says. \"Her movement was massively elected…and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement.\" The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice president might have been in on the plan. \"I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,\" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran. \"It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself.\" But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies. \"Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,\" Gunson says. Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability. In October, an ICG report warned that \"Washington should beware of regime change.\" \"The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,\" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities.

The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future. \"It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration, says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas Program at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies. But the challenges, he says, have only just begun. \"The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals…are going to take much more time to come to fruition. For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with. \"She's been a bit of an economic reformer,\" Gunson says. \"She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital.\"\n\nWatch: The key questions on Trump’s actions on Venezuela", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:20:37 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T05:13:28.494545"}

The US Africa Command branch of the US military said on 25 December that its “initial assessment is that multiple Isis terrorists were killed in the Isis camps”.\n\nMalik Samuel, a researcher with Good Governance Africa, said he had spoken to a Lakurawa member who said about 100 fighters were killed in a forest camp in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state. He said he was told that about 200 were missing, with many of the remaining fighters now trying to cross into Niger. This could not be independently confirmed.\n\nView image in fullscreen The effects of an airstrike in Offa, Nigeria. It is not known how many fighters were killed despite Donald Trump hailing ‘numerous perfect strikes’. Photograph: Abiodun Jamiu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nResidents of Nukuru, a village about 6 miles from the reported camp, told the BBC that fighters on about 15 motorcycles had fled through the community, riding three to a bike.\n\nMissile debris fell on empty farmland about 60 miles south in the town of Jabo, which local people said had never been attacked by Lakurawa. Debris also reportedly damaged a hotel 500 miles south of Tangaza, injuring three workers.\n\nIt remains unclear why the US specifically targeted Lakurawa, which operates in a rural, underdeveloped and almost entirely Muslim area in the north-west near the Niger border. Most violence in the area is perpetrated by armed gangs known as bandits.\n\nTrump had previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to stop the killing of Christians, an important theme for his evangelical base. Two US officials told the New York Times that the airstrikes were a one-off aimed at allowing Trump to claim he was going after a group that had killed Christians.\n\nView image in fullscreen A screengrab of an X post by the US Department of Defense showing a missile launch. Photograph: US Department of Defense/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMurtala Abdullahi, a Nigerian security consultant, also said Lakurawa was probably a symbolic target. “How do you establish a link that [a] bandit group has been hitting the Christian community?” he asked. “That’s difficult. But if you hit a jihadist group then you don’t need to establish a link.”\n\nAbdullahi said he did not know why the US had chosen to hit Lakurawa rather than Boko Haram, which is far more notorious internationally and attacks both Christians and Muslims.\n\nSince the airstrikes, global attention around Trump’s unpredictable, militarised foreign policy has turned to Venezuela, where US forces abducted Nicolás Maduro on 3 January, and Greenland, where Trump and other senior US officials have expressed renewed interest in a US takeover.\n\nVery little is known conclusively about Lakurawa, from the year it started to the number of fighters. Even the meaning of its name, which some analysts say is a Hausa pronunciation of “les recrues” (“the recruits” in French), is not an agreed fact.\n\nNigeria designated the group as a terrorist organisation in January 2025. Some analysts say the group is linked to Islamic State’s Sahel branch. However, Samuel said he had interviewed Lakurawa members who professed loyalty to al-Qaida.\n\nResearchers agree that the group’s senior members are from Mali or Nigeria. Local people in Sokoto state report that fighters speak Hausa with a foreign accent and a different language among themselves.\n\nIn about 2017, Lakurawa was invited by some local communities to protect them against bandits. However, the group has since turned to violent methods similar to those of the bandits, as well as enforcing their extreme version of Islam.\n\n“That coercive authority that they started asserting turned communities against them,” said Kato Van Broeckhoven, a United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research researcher.\n\nView image in fullscreen The effects of an airstrike in Jabo, Nigeria.

Just last week, gunmen killed more than 30 people in Niger state, in the centre-west of Nigeria, and abducted an unknown number of people. Local people told reporters they included students from a Catholic school where 300 pupils and teachers were kidnapped in November and only freed in December.\n\n“Why is Nigeria a fertile ground for all these groups to come in and operate?” Samuel said. “It is simple: because of governance issues … You see clearly the level of poverty in these places, you see clearly the absence of the state, the vacuum that has been created.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:03 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T05:13:28.951763"}

The tents that now serve as classrooms are noisy and a little chaotic but lively. Some teachers point to boards covered in English letters; others invite pupils to come forward and write basic Arabic words. It is nowhere near a normal school day. But after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in October, it's a start. After two years of war, the hum of lessons and chatter of classmates resonates around the ruins of what was once Lulwa Abdel Wahab al-Qatami School, in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in the south-western part of Gaza City. It was hit in January 2024, and for months afterwards, its grounds served as a shelter for displaced families. Today, it is again a place of learning - albeit in a more basic form. Walking in a straight line, their small arms resting on each other's shoulders, pupils smile as they head into the makeshift classrooms. For many, this is the first return to routine and education since the war began. According to Unicef, more than 97% of schools in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the war. The IDF has made repeated claims that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure including schools to carry out operations but has rarely provided solid evidence. Of the Strip's 658,000 school-aged children, most have had no formal education for nearly two years. During that time, many learned first-hand how hunger, displacement and death can shape their young lives. Now, something rare is emerging: a fragile glimpse of the childhoods they once knew.\n\nFor many children at this school, it's the first return to education since the war began\n\nFourteen-year-old Naeem al-Asmaar used to attend this school before it was destroyed. He lost his mother in an Israeli air strike during the war. \"It was the hardest thing I've ever been through,\" he says quietly. Although he was displaced for months, Naeem's home in Gaza City survived. After the ceasefire, he returned with his family. \"I missed being in school a lot,\" Naeem said adding that the difference is stark. \"Before the war, school was in real classrooms,\" \"Now it's tents. We only study four subjects. There isn't enough space. The education is not the same - but being here matters. School fills all my time and I really needed that.\" Rital Alaa Harb, a ninth-grade student who once studied here too, wants to become a dentist. \"Displacement affected my education completely,\" she says. \"There was no time to study. No schools. I missed my friends so much - and I miss my old school.\" The makeshift school is run by Unicef and brings together children from the original Lulwa school and others displaced by the war. It does not teach the full Palestinian curriculum - only the basics: Arabic, English, mathematics and science. The principal, Dr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber, has worked in education for 24 years. He took over management of the site in mid-November. \"We started with determination,\" he said, \"to compensate students for what they lost.\"\n\nDr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber says many of the children are struggling with trauma\n\nThe school currently serves 1,100 boys and girls, operating in three shifts a day - with boys attending on alternating days from girls. There are just 24 teachers. \"Before the war,\" Dr Schheiber says, \"our students learned in fully equipped schools - science labs, computer labs, internet access, educational resources. All of that is gone.\" There is no electricity here. No internet. And many children are struggling with trauma. More than 100 students at the school lost one or both parents, had their homes destroyed, or witnessed killings during the war. In total, Dr Schheiber says, every student has been affected - directly or indirectly. A counsellor now runs psychological support sessions, trying to help children process what they have endured. Despite the effort, demand far exceeds capacity. \"We have more than a thousand students here already,\" Dr Schheiber says. \"But only six classrooms per shift. There is a large displacement camp next to the school - families from northern and eastern Gaza. Many children want to enrol. We simply cannot take them.\"\n\nMany parents say their children have lost years of education\n\nFor parents, the return to school brings relief as well as anxiety. Huda Bassam al-Dasouki, a mother of five displaced from southern Rimal, says education has become an overwhelming challenge. \"It's not that education doesn't exist,\" she says. \"It's that it's extremely difficult.\" Even before the war, schools struggled with shortages, she says. Now, basic supplies are unaffordable or unavailable. \"A notebook that cost one shekel ($0.31; £0.23) before the war now costs five,\" she says. \"I have five children.\" Some children, she says, have fallen four years behind, including time lost during the Covid pandemic. \"My son can't read.

Chen Zhi was among three Chinese nationals arrested on 6 January after a joint investigation into transnational crime lasting several months, Cambodia said. The US charged the 37-year-old last October with running internet scams from Cambodia that it said had stolen billions in cryptocurrency. The UK also sanctioned his global business empire, Prince Group. Cambodian authorities have also suspended the operations of Prince Bank, a subsidiary of Prince Group.\n\nThe bank has been placed under liquidation and banned from offering new banking services - though customers can still withdraw money and repay loans, the National Bank of Cambodia said on Thursday. Last year, US authorities seized about $15bn (£11bn) worth of bitcoin that alleged belonged to Chen, in what FBI Director Kash Patel described as \"one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history\". The BBC contacted Prince Group for comment at the time. In the past, the Cambodia-based group has denied any involvement in scams. Its website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. Since Chen Zhi was indicted by the US on fraud and money-laundering charges in October, his whereabouts have been unclear. But on Wednesday, the Cambodian authorities said they had \"arrested three Chinese nationals namely Chen Zhi, Xu Ji Liang, and Shao Ji Hui and extradited [them] to the People's Republic of China\". The interior ministry statement did not say where Chen Zhi had been detained. His Cambodian nationality had been revoked by royal decree last month, it added. The enigmatic tycoon had given up his Chinese nationality to become a Cambodian citizen in 2014.\n\nThe UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia, many of them to Cambodia, lured by the promise of legitimate jobs and then forced to run online scams. People are held against their will in the scam farms and made to defraud strangers online under the threat of punishment or torture. Many of those trapped are Chinese and targeted people in China.\n\nEPA Scam centres have proliferated in South East Asia - above, people rescued from compounds in Myanmar last February are seen arriving in Thailand\n\nChinese authorities have also been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020.

The government has said little since the US and UK sanctioned Prince Group, apart from urging US and UK authorities to be sure they had sufficient evidence for their allegations. By some estimates, scam businesses may account for around half of the entire Cambodian economy. \"I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,\" Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who has investigated Chen Zhi, told the BBC last year.

Nine people were detained on Tuesday after police raided their homes and the church office in Chengdu, the Early Rain Covenant Church said. Five of them had been released by Wednesday. More than 1,000 miles away in Wenzhou, authorities began demolishing the Yayang Church building, as seen in video obtained by the non-profit ChinaAid, which monitors religious persecution. This latest wave of arrests, after others last year, shows the Communist Party's resolve to snuff out churches that do not align with its ideology, Christian groups say.\n\nThe BBC has contacted China's embassy in the UK for comment. Authorities have not made any statements about the arrests, or the demolition in Wenzhou. China promotes atheism and controls religion. The government said in 2018 there are 44 million Christians in the country, but it's unclear if that number includes those who attend the many underground churches. The Party has long pressured Christians to join only state-sanctioned churches led by government-approved pastors. But Christian groups say the grip has tightened noticeably, with arrests becoming more common and prompt. At least two church leaders in China have told the BBC that authorities are swiftly arresting unauthorised church leaders, while in the past, these individuals would first be warned, then fined and finally detained if they still refuse to comply with orders.\n\nGetty Images Under Xi Jinping, China has tightened its grip on religious freedom\n\nJust weeks ago, Li Yingqiang, the current leader of Early Rain Covenant Church, had said he \"sensed a storm gathering\" and referred to \"the imminent prospect of... another large-scale crackdown\". \"I dearly hope that none of our families shall ever again endure such a storm. Yet as an elder appointed by the Lord to stand among you... it is my duty to remind you all to prepare yourselves before the storm returns,\" he wrote in a letter to church members in November. Li and his wife Zhang Xinyue are among the four who remain in detention. Their church described the arrests as a \"concerted operation\" but said the grounds for arrest, and whether those detained have been charged, remain unclear. It added that it had lost contact with two other members but did not say they had been detained. \"The situation is ongoing, with specific details yet to be fully confirmed,\" Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) said in a statement to members and supporters. It also also sought prayers for its members' safety and their perseverance in the Christian faith. In Wenzhou, local authorities brought in bulldozers, cranes and heavy machinery earlier this week, and started taking down part of the Yayang Church building, as seen in the video. ChinaAid said it was told by multiple sources that hundreds of armed and special police officers have been deployed to stand guard outside the building. Sometimes known as \"the Jerusalem of China\", Wenzhou has more Christians than any other city in the country. Residents living near Yayang Church have been \"driven away\", while those working in the area has been instructed not to take photographs or record video, ChinaAid said. \"The massive mobilisation against the two major independent church networks shows the central government is determined to stamp out Christian churches entirely, unless the church is totally indoctrinated into the party's ideology,\" said Bob Fu, who founded ChinaAid.\n\nChinaAid Local authorities have started taking down part of Yayang Church's building", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:01:19 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T12:58:18.061472"}

Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance.\n\nBoth Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale.

The accord follows complaints that religious leaders had failed to tackle the issue adequately. It means the government will manage possible compensation in co-ordination with the Church, handling cases where other legal avenues are no longer available because the alleged crime took place too long ago or the individual accused has passed away. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered.\n\n\"A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up,\" said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement. He added that the agreement sought to \"pay off an historic, moral debt that we had with victims of abuse within the Church\". The other signatories were Luis Argüello, president of the Episcopal Conference and leader of the Spanish Catholic Church, and Jesús Díaz Sariego, president of Confer, which represents Catholic congregations and religious orders. Mr Sariego said the initiative was unprecedented as it tackled crimes that had gone past the statute of limitations. Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as \"another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling\".\n\nA 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people. The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church.\n\nIn November, the Church said that 58 cases had been \"resolved\" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s. Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid.\n\nEPA Pope Francis apologised many times about the scandal that shook the Catholic Church\n\nUnder the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman. Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution. The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified. However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries. In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as \"too small\".

People have taken to the streets of Minneapolis to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Good, who died on Wednesday after being shot in her car. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials from involvement in the case, but the US vice-president said the investigation is a federal issue. Officials have offered differing accounts of the incident, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would investigate the incident. Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said the FBI had initially agreed to a joint investigation with state officials but then reversed course and denied the state access to materials and evidence.

Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard. The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. At the scene of the crash on Thursday, blood from the shooting could still be seen in the snow. People set up a vigil at the site to honour Good, lining the bank with candles and roses. Hundreds of demonstrators showed up throughout the day, shouting insults at ICE and offering their neighbours coffee on the cold winter day.

The protests remained largely peaceful there, as residents expressed their anger over the killing of Good. \"They cannot get away with killing someone. There has to be consequences for actions,\" said Gavin, one of dozens of people outside the federal building. Those who knew Good said she was a poet and guitarist who had just moved to the city of Minneapolis.

The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York. The release of political prisoners in Venezuela has been a long-held US demand, especially during moments of heightened repression around elections or protests.\n\nJorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that \"a significant number\" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.

Petro said the United States is treating other nations as part of a US \"empire\". It comes after Trump threatened Colombia with military action. He said that the US risks transforming from \"dominating the world\" to becoming \"isolated from the world.\" He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like \"Nazi brigades\". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US. The BBC has approached the White House for comment.\n\nFollowing US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to \"watch his ass\", remarks Petro strongly condemned. Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the \"near future. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honour\". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric \"from both sides.\" But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved. He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, \"most of it occupied by me,\" and covered \"drug trafficking Colombia\" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and \"what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States.\" Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like \"Nazi brigades\". President Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations, and has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking. Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US. The administration says it deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had \"voluntarily self-deported\", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention. About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University. This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight. Federal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city. Petro said ICE had \"reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens.\" He added that if this continued, \"instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world.\" Petro said the US has for \"decades\" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an \"empire\" regardless of the law.\n\nThe two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over \"oil and coal,\" adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, \"there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America.\" \"The Venezuelan issue is about this,\" he said. After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy. Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a \"real threat\", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said \"the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations.\" Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would \"prefer it to be about dialogue.\" He said that \"work is being done\" on this. But he added: \"Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies.\" \"It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have.\" Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia. He said Venezuela had \"long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies,\" adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other \"covert operations\" in Colombia. He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants.

Almameh Gibba, an MP and one of the plaintiffs, tabled a bill to decriminalise FGM that was rejected by the country’s parliament in 2024.\n\nActivists and lawyers see this as the latest move in a backlash against women’s rights that is eroding gender protections across the world.\n\nFatou Baldeh, founder of the Gambian rights organisation Women in Liberation & Leadership, said: “FGM is a strong manifestation of violence against women that harms their physical and psychological health.\n\n“If this issue is still being [debated at a national level], it shows us that women’s rights are really regressing. This is not an isolated issue – it’s part of a global regression on women’s rights.”\n\nThe Gambia has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world. Almost three-quarters of women between 15 and 49 have undergone the practice and nearly two-thirds of them were cut before the age of five.\n\nView image in fullscreen Members of the Gambian parliament debating whether to reverse the ban on FGM at the parliament in the capital, Banjul, in 2024. Photograph: Malick Njie/Reuters\n\nFGM involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, which can have serious long-term health consequences, including infertility. It is generally carried out without anaesthesia by untrained “cutters” using non-sterile instruments such as knives, razor blades or pieces of glass, and girls are usually forcibly restrained.\n\nThe practice is considered to be a grave violation of human rights and in 2012 the UN passed a resolution to ban it. Although is still practised in about 30 countries in Africa and Asia, FGM has no medical basis and is performed solely for cultural or religious reasons.\n\nView image in fullscreen Abdoulie Fatty, a leading imam who supports FGM. Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters\n\nUnder the current law in the Gambia, a cutter faces up to three years in prison, a fine of 50,000 dalasi (£500), or both. Where FGM leads to death, the perpetrator could face life imprisonment.\n\nAlthough criminalised in 2015, the law went unenforced until the first convictions took place in 2023. Three women were ordered to pay a fine or spend a year in prison for carrying out FGM on eight children. The convictions sparked a backlash against the ban, which led the country to the brink of repealing it.\n\nAfter the bill to overturn the law criminalising FGM was rejected, a coalition led by Gibba launched a case with the supreme court claiming that the law violated Gambians’ constitutional rights to cultural and religious freedoms.\n\nThe court has heard from two witnesses so far, Abdoulie Fatty, a prominent Muslim leader, claimed in December that female circumcision, though not mutilation, was part of Islam and was not harmful.\n\nWhen asked what he said to the families of two people who died from the practice, he replied: “We are Muslims and if someone dies, it’s God’s will.”\n\nHe said that the benefit of the practice was to reduce women’s sexual desire, which could be a problem for men.\n\nAlso due to give evidence is Fuambai Sia Nyoko Ahmadu, a dual US-Sierra Leonean citizen and founder of a pro-FGM organisation, Gambian Women are Free to Choose.\n\nIn December, she co-wrote an article, Harms of the current global anti-FGM campaign, for the BMJ Journal of Medical Ethics. The piece argued that “a ubiquitous ‘standard tale’ obscures the diversity of practices, meanings and experiences among those affected” by cutting.\n\nRepresenting the plaintiffs is Lamin J Darboe, a UK-trained lawyer with dual British-Gambian citizenship; he has announced a bid to run for the presidency in the country’s elections in December.\n\nView image in fullscreen People drive past a poster in Banjul calling for an end to female genital mutilation. The Gambia has one of the world’s highest rates of FGM. Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters\n\nIt comes after a ruling against Sierra Leone in July by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) court of justice, which described FGM as “one of the worst forms of violence against women” which “meets the threshold for torture”.\n\nThe president of Sierra Leone, Julius Maada Bio, is the current chair of Ecowas. Weeks after the ruling, he signed into law the Child Rights Act 2025, which did not ban FGM.\n\n“It speaks volumes that he refused to act on the ruling,” said Baldeh. “Within the region we have all these beautiful protocols and treaties protecting women and girls, which are all against FGM, yet nothing is being done.”\n\nAlso in Sierra Leone, there has been significant opposition to a bill on safe motherhood, which led to proposed amendments that restrict access to safe abortion.\n\nIt is widely seen as part of a new wave of attacks on women’s rights worldwide. In Afghanistan, the Taliban is eroding any rights women had before the militant Islamists seized power; in the US, restrictions on access to abortion and contraception services are increasing, and in Iran, women are key targets of the regime.\n\nAccording to a report by Equality Now, new legislative proposals in Bolivia and Uruguay threaten to weaken protections against sexual violence.\n\n“Civil society organisations face increasing pressure under repressive laws, such as in India and Kyrgyzstan, while government bodies responsible for advancing women’s rights are being dismantled in South Korea and Argentina,” said the report.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:00:29 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T06:49:46.508959"}

Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions. It only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024. Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack on Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.\n\nWhile the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv. Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border. The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart. \"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's home in December.

There has been a significant backlash after the chatbot honoured requests from users to digitally alter images of other people by undressing them without their consent. But Grok is now telling people asking it to make such material that only paid subscribers would be able to do so - meaning their name and payment information must be on file. The BBC has approached X for comment.\n\nThose who do not subscribe can still use Grok to edit images on its separate app and website. \"Musk has thrown his toys out of the pram in protest at being held to account for the tsunami of abuse,\" said Professor Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse. \"Instead of taking the responsible steps to ensure Grok could not be used for abusive purposes, it has withdrawn access for the vast majority of users.\" And Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation, said it \"does not undo the harm which has been done\". \"We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery we have seen in recent days,\" she said., The charity previously said its analysts had discovered \"criminal imagery\" of girls aged between 11 and 13 which \"appeared to have been created\" using Grok. \"Sitting and waiting for unsafe products to be abused before taking action is unacceptable,\" Swirsky said. It comes after the government urged regulator Ofcom to use all its powers – up to and including an effective ban – against X over concerns about unlawful AI images created on the site. Addressing concerns that sexualised images of adults and children had been generated by Grok, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\". He said Ofcom had the government's \"full support\" to act on the content. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table,\" he said in an interview with Greatest Hits Radio. Government sources told BBC News: \"We would expect Ofcom to use all powers at its disposal in regard to Grok and X.\" Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping the Elon Musk-owned platform raise money or be accessed in the UK.

In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting \"death to the dictator\", referencing Khamenei. In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard. Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured. Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.

Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough. \"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\" \"And by the way Nato's got to understand that,\" the US president added. Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\". Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\". They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".\n\nConcerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week. In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change.

He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.\n\nMany of the victims' families had demanded action like this from the start: more than a week after the fire, the anger in this community has been increasing.\n\nAt the main ceremony in Martigny, down in the valley, relatives of the dead were joined by survivors. Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support.\n\n\"The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic,\" a young woman called Marie told the audience.\n\nShe had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames.\n\nShe said she would never forget what she'd seen.\n\nListening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations.\n\nBack in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified.\n\n\"This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs,\" Giorgia Meloni said.\n\nShe wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started.\n\n\"Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys.\"\n\nIn Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more.\n\nFor now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors. They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged.\n\nNow Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody. In a statement, the public ministry said the move followed a \"new assessment of the flight risk.\"\n\n\"I constantly think of the victims and of the people who are struggling,\" his wife told a crush of TV cameras after several hours of questioning at the ministry.\n\nIt was her first public comment since the fire.\n\n\"It is an unimaginable tragedy. It happened in our establishment, and I would like to apologise.\"\n\nNine days on, Le Constellation is still obscured from view behind white plastic sheets. A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow.\n\nWhat unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened.\n\nMobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly.\n\nWhen the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked.\n\nBut another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable.\n\n\"Be careful with the foam,\" the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers.\n\nBut the questions here are not just for the owners.\n\nThis week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years.\n\nThey offered no explanation.\n\n\"It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape,\" Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations.\n\nSix Italians were killed as a result.\n\n\"Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice,\" the ambassador stressed.\n\nThat includes for those with life-changing injuries.\n\nThe regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year.\n\n\"They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child,\" hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers.\n\nBut he's proud of how his team coped.\n\nSome casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them.\n\nThe most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition.\n\nAll face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a \"rebirth\" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face.\n\n\"First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity,\" Professor Bonvin says.\n\n\"It will take a lot of work and resilience.\"\n\nAdd to that the anguish of surviving.\n\n\"They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother,\" Bonvin explains.\n\n\"It is a delicate moment.\"\n\nIn central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas.\n\nAfter leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment.

The vast island finds itself in the eye of a geopolitical storm with Trump's name on it and people here are clearly unnerved. Yet when you fly in, it looks so peaceful. Ice and snow-capped mountains stretch as far as the eye can see, interrupted here and there by glittering fjords - all between the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. It is said to sit on top of the world; much of it above the Arctic Circle. Greenland is nine times the size of the UK but it only has 57,000 inhabitants, most of them indigenous Inuit.\n\nThe scene on a snowy street in Nuuk, Greenland's capital city\n\nYou find the biggest cluster of Greenlanders on the south-western coast in the capital, Nuuk. We arrived there as a frozen twilight was creeping across snow-covered pedestrian streets. Parents dragged their children home from school on sledges, and students mooched their way in and out of brightly-lit malls. Few wanted to talk to us about the Trump-related angst here. Those who did sounded very gloomy. One pensioner banged his walking stick on the ground in emphasis as he told me the US must never plant its flag in Greenland's capital. A lady who said she was mistrustful of everyone these days, and didn't give her name, admitted she was \"scared to death\" about the prospect of Trump taking the island by force after she watched his military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nPilu Chemnitz (left) says Greenlanders \"just want to be left alone\"\n\nMeanwhile, 20-something pottery-maker Pilu Chemnitz said: \"I think we are all very tired of the US president. We have always lived a quiet and peaceful life here. \"Of course, the colonisation by Denmark caused a lot of trauma for many people but we just want to be left alone.\" Never mind opposing a takeover by the US, which 85% of Greenlanders say they do, most also say they favour independence from Denmark - although many tell me they also appreciate the subsidies coming from there that help prop up their welfare state. While rich in untapped natural resources, poverty is a real issue here in Inuit communities. Overall, Greenlanders want a bigger, louder say, not only in their domestic policies, but in foreign affairs too. I went to the island's modest-looking parliament, the body of it built in a Scandinavian style with wooden slats and painted the same burnished red as the Greenlandic flags fluttering by the entrance. No security checks. All pretty relaxed. Except for the roaring polar bear emblem - a symbol of Greenland, etched onto every sliding glass doors we pass.\n\nPipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen hopes Marco Rubio's talks next week with Danish officials \"will end with understanding and compromise\"\n\nI was there to meet Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen, co-chair of the foreign affairs committee in parliament. She is an MP with the pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party that is part of the coalition government here. \"I think it's very important for us to speak out about what we want as a people,\" she told me. \"We have always worked towards independence when we got home rule in 1979 and more independence in 2009.\" I asked Lynge-Rasmussen if she felt that big global powers - the US, Denmark, Nato, and the EU - were talking a lot about Greenland right now, rather than to the islanders about their fate. She nodded vigorously. Surprisingly, perhaps, she blames Denmark more than she blames Trump for overlooking Greenlanders' wants and needs. Even though Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, she says, she feels they have always been treated like second-class citizens. But Lynge-Rasmussen insisted that Greenlanders should not see themselves as victims in the current situation. Instead, she suggests they use the international spotlight now on them to show off their importance and push for their priorities. What of the meeting next week with Rubio, I asked? \"I hope the meeting will end with understanding and compromise,\" she answered. \"Maybe doing business with [the US] from here… maybe co-operating on trade, or mining, having more American [military] bases on Greenland, perhaps?\" Under a bilateral agreement with Denmark dating back to 1951 the US may bring as many US troops as it wants to Greenland. This has left European allies wondering out loud why Trump feels the need to \"take\" the island unilaterally: whether buying it - seemingly Washington's preferred option, or encouraging Greenlanders to vote in a plebiscite to become part of the US, or taking Greenland by force, something the Trump administration has refused to rule out. It wouldn't take much flexing of military muscles. Greenland has few trained soldiers and no military bases of its own. Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance justify their need to \"take\" Greenland because they say Denmark doesn't do enough to secure the island. Copenhagen disputes this. It's also worth noting that the US already has a military base on Greenland - and it chose to radically reduce its presence there from about 10,000 personnel during peak Cold War times to some 200 now. The US has long taken its eye off Arctic security, until recently. Trump's keen interest in the island is likely a mix of: perceived national security concerns\n\na hunger for the rich natural resources Greenland boasts, including rare earths and minerals\n\nand his loudly-trumpeted desire to dominate the Americas.\n\nSnow-covered houses in Nuuk at nighttime", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:01:50 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-10T06:38:20.836106"}

Switzerland, often praised for its efficiency, has a very devolved system of government, in which villages and towns are run by local officials elected from and by the community. It is a system the Swiss cherish, because they believe it ensures accountability. But there are inherent weaknesses: hypothetically, the official approving a bar license or passing a fire-safety check is the friend, neighbour, or maybe even cousin of the bar owner.\n\nWatch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor says\n\nWhen the news of the fire emerged on New Year's Eve, first there was shock. Such devastating fires are not, people thought, supposed to happen in Switzerland. Then there was grief - 40 young people lost their lives, 116 were injured, many of them very seriously. Questions followed - what caused such a catastrophe? And finally, this week - fury when Crans-Montana's Mayor, Nicolas Feraud, revealed that Le Constellation bar had not been inspected since 2019. Crans-Montana is in the Swiss canton of Valais, where fire-safety inspections are the responsibility of Mayor Feraud and his colleagues, and they are supposed to happen every 12 months. Not only had the checks not taken place, the mayor said, he had only become aware of this after the fire. And, he revealed, of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected in 2025. Asked why, Feraud had no answer, though he did suggest Crans-Montana had too few inspectors for the number of properties that needed checking. This was echoed by Romy Biner, the mayor of neighbouring upmarket resort Zermatt, who told local media that many communities in the canton of Valais did not have the required resources to inspect so many premises. This is not a line that plays well with many Swiss, who know that Crans-Montana and Zermatt are two of the richest winter resorts in the country. So when Feraud faced the press, there were pointed questions from Swiss journalists: How well did the mayor know the bar's owners? Had he ever been to the bar? And, was there any possibility of corruption? \"Absolutely not,\" was his indignant answer to the last question. The mother of two brothers who survived the fire also had questions. \"We urgently need complete, transparent answers,\" she wrote on social media. When they escaped the burning bar, each of her sons had thought at first that the other was dead. \"They escaped, but they are deeply traumatised. They will carry the emotional scars forever.\" Those questions, from journalists and families, reveal the problems of Switzerland's devolved political system.\n\n'A failure right across the board'", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:19:34 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-10T06:38:20.980559"}

One doctor said an eye hospital in Tehran had gone into crisis mode, while the BBC also obtained a message from a medic in another hospital saying it did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx of patients. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said Iran was in \"big trouble\" and warned \"you better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too\". Iran, in a letter to the UN Security Council, blamed the US for turning the protests into what it called \"violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism\".\n\nMeanwhile, international leaders called for the right to peaceful protest to be protected. Anti-government protests have taken place in dozens of cities, with at least 50 protesters reported killed by two human rights groups. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran, and the country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. A doctor from Iran, who contacted the BBC via Starlink satellite internet on Friday night, said Farabi Hospital, Tehran's main eye specialist centre, had gone into crisis mode, with emergency services overwhelmed. Non-urgent admissions and surgeries were said to have been suspended, and staff called in to deal with emergency cases. The BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic in a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday. The medic said large numbers of injured people were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx. He claimed many of the wounded had gunshot injuries to the head and eyes.\n\nWatch: Protesters take to the streets of Tehran on Friday night\n\nSince protests began on 28 December, at least 50 protesters and 15 security personnel have been killed, according to the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). More than 2,311 individuals have also been arrested, the group reported. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed. BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. United Nations Secretary General spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the UN was very disturbed by the loss of life. \"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said. French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement that said: \"The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal.\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday, saying: \"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this.\" Later, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated the message, saying Iran \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\".

The search for answers set off a battle for the truth.", "content": "'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Joel Gunter , senior international reporter, New Brunswick and Nadine Yousif , senior Canada reporter, New Brunswick Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nFive hundred people in a small Canadian province were diagnosed with a mystery brain disease. What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?\n\nIn early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD. CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning. Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died. Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped. More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q. Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"\n\nMany of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nOver the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease. Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\". To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests. We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying. The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real. Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up. \"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"\n\nLucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\". Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself. \"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\" Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.\n\nJillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nMarrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle. It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients. \"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease. \"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\" In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers. Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists. \"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star. \"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.\n\nDr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nAt the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate. And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\". \"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote. But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\". Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email. \"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote. \"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"\n\nThe early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit. Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.) According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"\n\nBy April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery. But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said. None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province. But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up. \"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"\n\nTaking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists. Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists. Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.\n\nA protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nBut the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying. At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\" Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone. \"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\" Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\" In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero. Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"\n\nJillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nShe wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion. Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\" Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant. \"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"\n\nAs the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told. Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness. \"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.\n\nKevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nThe couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\" Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said. Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion. Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\" But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.\n\nSandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nOne thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment. Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\" Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"\n\nGabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path. Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school. Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.\n\nGabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nMarrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them. \"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\" There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang. After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology. The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition. A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it. The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers. \"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.\n\nGlobal News Gabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)\n\nThe call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\" \"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\" Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition. Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life. \"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. \"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"\n\nLang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her. Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade. Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".\n\nDr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)\n\nThe cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met. The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.\n\nOn a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said. Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care. Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated. \"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\" Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"\n\nDr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)\n\nAn upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\" The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists. Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said. Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground. \"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said. \"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\" Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint. And that was the issue, one former senior health official said. \"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"\n\nThe last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\" Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse. In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.\n\nJillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said.

Verified videos and eyewitness accounts seen by the BBC appeared to show the government was ramping up its response, as it continues an overarching internet blackout. The country's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, said on Saturday that anyone protesting would be considered an \"enemy of God\" - an offence that carries the death penalty. Hundreds of protesters are believed to have been killed or injured since protests began more than two weeks ago, and many more detained.\n\nThe protests were sparked by soaring inflation, and have spread to more than 100 cities and towns across every province in Iran. Now protesters are calling for an end to the clerical rulership of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Iranian government has imposed the internet shutdown in an effort to stop the protests. Iran's data infrastructure is tightly controlled by the state and security authorities. Internet access is largely limited to a domestic intranet, with restricted links to the outside world. Over the past few years, the government has progressively curtailed access to the global internet. However, during the current round of protests, authorities have, for the first time, not only shut down access to the worldwide internet but also severely restricted the domestic intranet. An expert told BBC Persian that the current shutdown is more severe than that imposed during the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" uprising three years ago. Alireza Manafi, an internet researcher, said internet access in Iran, in any form, was now \"almost completely down\". He added the only likely way to connect to the outside world was via Starlink, but warned users to exercise caution, as such connections could potentially be traced by the government. The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Nonetheless, some video footage has emerged, and the BBC has spoken to people on the ground. Verified video from Saturday night showed protesters taking over the streets in Tehran's Gisha district. Several videos, verified and confirmed as recent by BBC Verify, show clashes between protesters and security forces on Vakil Abad Boulevard in Mashhad, Iran's second largest city. Masked protesters are seen taking cover behind wheelie bins and bonfires, while a row of security forces is seen in the distance. A vehicle that appears to be a bus is engulfed in flames. Multiple gunshots and what sounds like banging on pots and pans can be heard as a green laser beam lights up the scene. A figure standing on a nearby footbridge is visible in the footage and appears to fire multiple gunshots in several directions as a couple of people take cover behind a fence on the side of the boulevard. A few videos have also emerged from the capital Tehran. One video, authenticated by BBC Verify, shows a large group of protesters and the sound of banging on pots in Punak Square in west Tehran, which has been one of the hotspots of protests this week. Another clip, filmed in the Heravi district in north-east Tehran and confirmed by BBC Persian and BBC Verify, shows a crowd of protesters marching on a road and calling for the end of the clerical establishment.\n\n'US ready to help'\n\nOn Saturday, US President Donald Trump wrote on social media: \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" He did not elaborate, but US media reported that Trump had been briefed on options for military strikes in the country. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that the briefings had taken place, with the Journal describing them as \"preliminary discussions\". An unnamed official told the WSJ there was no \"imminent threat\" to Iran, the paper wrote. Last year, the US conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. US Senator Lindsey Graham posted several times in support of the protests on social media, writing: \"To the Iranian people: your long nightmare is soon coming to a close.\" Their \"bravery and determination to end your oppression\" had been \"noticed\" by the US president, he said. \"Help is on the way,\" he added in the same post. Earlier, he said: \"To the regime leadership: your brutality against the great people of Iran will not go unchallenged.\" As dawn broke on Sunday in Iran, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah (king), whose return protesters have been calling for, posted a video to X. Its caption said: \"Know that you are not alone. Your compatriots around the world are proudly shouting your voice... In particular, President Trump, as the leader of the free world, has carefully observed your indescribable bravery and has announced that he is ready to help you.\" He added: \"I know that I will soon be by your side.\" US-based Pahlavi has been calling for people to take to the streets, and has said he is preparing to return to the country. He claimed the Islamic republic was facing a \"severe shortage of mercenaries\" and that \"many armed and security forces have left their workplaces or disobeyed orders to suppress the people\". The BBC could not verify these claims. Pahlavi encouraged people to continue protesting on Sunday evening, but to stay in groups or with crowds and not \"endanger your lives\".\n\nWatch: Protesters take to the streets of Tehran on Friday night", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:44:56 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-11T05:56:36.191265"}

The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel in Iran, while sources tell the BBC the death toll could be much higher. Trump has threatened to intervene, and said on Sunday that Iranian officials had called him \"to negotiate\" - but added \"we may have to act before a meeting\".

In a video announcing the probe, Powell said the US justice department served the agency with subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. He called the probe \"unprecedented\" and said he believed it was opened due to him drawing Donald Trump's ire over refusing to lower interest rates despite repeated public pressure from the president. The Fed chair is the latest to come at odds with Trump and then face criminal investigation by the US justice department.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the justice department and the White House for comment. \"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said. \"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" he went on to say. Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Sunday that he did not have any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the Fed. \"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he said of Powell. The probe, which prosecutors have not confirmed, would signal a fresh escalation in Trump's ongoing dispute with Powell, who the president nominated for the role as Fed chair in 2017.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to remove Powell, who he has criticised for not cutting interest rates as quickly as the president would have liked. In the second half of 2025, the Fed cut interest rates three times. The president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, and interest rates for inflation and costs in the US. Critics have raised concerns that Trump's pressure to oust the Fed chair would muddy the institution's authority to set interest rates independently from presidents. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, \"until this legal matter is fully resolved\". \"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement. \"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" the senator said. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said she believed Trump's plan was to push Powell off the Fed board for good and \"install another sock puppet to complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank\". \"This committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair,\" she said. Powell's investigation will be overseen by the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, according to the New York Times, which first reported the probe. April Larusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment, told the BBC's Today programme that \"it really isn't the case that the Federal Reserve has been doing nothing on interest rates so this does feel like perhaps it is pressure that isn't really justified\". She added that Trump wants lower rates as \"he is definitely trying to make sure that all parts of the economy benefit\". \"For people at the lower end of the income spectrum things have been difficult – inflation was very high, wages were not keeping up with inflation - and so there is a big part of the US population that frankly is still suffering with a cost of living crisis.\" The criminal probe into Powell, together with news of continued unrest in Iran, sparked a jump in the price of precious metals. The price of gold - which is often seen a safer asset in times of uncertainty - was up 1.4% at $4,572.36 per ounce on Monday, having hit a record high of $4,600.33 earlier. Silver also hit a record high - of $84.58 an ounce - before slipping back to $83.26 per ounce, a rise of 5.4% for the day.\n\nTrump previously took aim at Lisa Cook, a governor at the US central bank, whom he tried to fire over alleged mortgage fraud. The case was blocked by a US federal court and will be heard by the Supreme Court later this month. Criminal charges brought by Trump's justice department against political adversaries like New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against Trump in 2024, and ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation boss James Comey were also dismissed by a court. Comey was accused of making false statements and obstructing justice. He was fired by Trump during his first term after leading a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, which Trump won over Hillary Clinton. Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and said the prosecutions were politically charged.\n\nWatch: Trump jokes he wants Powell to lower interest rates in awkward exchange", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 03:26:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-12T09:17:53.855372"}

Chalamet, 30, continued his pursuit of greatness, and an Oscar, by beating stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to the award for best actor in a musical or comedy for table tennis caper Marty Supreme. Despite DiCaprio missing out, his film One Battle After Another won the most awards overall, with four prizes including best musical or comedy film and best director. Irish actress Jessie Buckley was named best drama actress for Hamnet, which also scored a surprise win in the best drama film category.\n\nVampire thriller Sinners had been considered the frontrunner, but it instead went home with the box office achievement prize as well as best score. The Golden Globes are a key stop on the road to the Academy Awards, and other acting winners on Sunday included Teyana Taylor, Rose Byrne, Wagner Moura and Stellan Skarsgård. Unlike the Oscars, the Globes also reward TV shows, and the night saw British actors Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty pick up more honours for their performances in Netflix drama Adolescence.\n\nWatch: Stars light up the red carpet at the 83rd Annual Golden Globes\n\nChalamet's 'sweet' win\n\nGetty Images Kylie Jenner didn't walk the red carpet with Chalamet, but met him inside the ceremony\n\nWith all eyes on the Oscars race, Timothée Chalamet's victory has given him a boost over his rivals. \"I'm in a category with many greats,\" he said when accepting his trophy. It was Chalamet's fifth Globes nomination, but his first win. \"My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up, always be grateful for what you have,\" he said. \"It's allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments make this moment that much sweeter. \"For my parents, for my partner, I love you so much,\" he added, looking at girlfriend Kylie Jenner.\n\nJessie Buckley says win is 'real honour'\n\nGetty Images Hamnet's Jessie Buckley won best actress, a category she is expected to sweep throughout awards season\n\nJessie Buckley was named best actress for her role in the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's best-selling novel Hamnet, about the death of William Shakespeare's son. \"This is not a normal feeling or situation to be in,\" she said in her acceptance speech. \"It was such an extraordinary set to be part of, because we were telling the story of probably the most famous Brit that ever lived, and we had a Chinese director, a lot of Irish, a mostly Polish crew, beside our British family.\" She concluded: \"This is a real honour, I love being part of this industry.\" Shortly afterwards, Hamnet director Chloe Zhao looked visibly shocked when the movie was announced as the winner of best drama film. Accepting the prize, producer Steven Spielberg said he had \"loved the book\" by O'Farrell, but felt Zhao was \"the only film-maker on the face of the planet who could tell the story\". Zhao said: \"The village of Hamnet that made this film together. Some of them lost their loved ones while we were making this film, and some of them are still struggling, and I just wanted to say we're thinking of you, we're here because of you, we love you.\"\n\nTeyana Taylor's tearful message\n\nGetty Images Teyana Taylor was named best supporting actress for One Battle After Another\n\nElsewhere, singer and actress Teyana Taylor, whose career started when she choreographed a Beyonce music video at the age of 15, cemented her Hollywood breakthrough by winning best supporting film actress for One Battle After Another. After tearfully thanking a list of people, she used her acceptance speech to send a message to \"my brown sisters and little brown girls watching tonight\". \"Our light does not need permission to shine,\" she told them. \"We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nSwedish actor Stellan Skarsgård, 74, won best supporting actor for Sentimental Value, and joked that he hadn't prepared a speech \"because I thought that I was too old\". He then made an impassioned plea for people to see films like his on the big screen. \"Cinema should be seen in cinemas,\" he said to cheers from the crowd.\n\nAustralia's Rose Byrne was named best actress in a film musical or comedy for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, and paid tribute to members of her family. \"My brother's my date. Thanks, George,\" she laughed. \"Thanks to my mum and dad, who bought Paramount+ so they could watch the Golden Globes from Sydney. \"And I want to thank my husband, Bobby Cannavale. He couldn't be here because, um, we're getting a bearded dragon, and he went to a reptile expo in New Jersey. So thank you, baby.\"\n\nGetty Images Rose Byrne was named best musical or comedy actress for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You\n\nMeanwhile, KPop Demon Hunters won best animated film and best song for Golden. Brazilian political thriller The Secret Agent was named best international film, while its star Wagner Moura won best drama actor. \"This is a film about generational trauma,\" Moura said, \"and I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too. So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments.\" Paul Thomas Anderson won best film director and screenplay for One Battle After Another. \"You guys are being so generous with this affection for me and this film,\" Anderson said, adding: \"I love doing what I do.\"\n\nAdolescence star 'still learning'\n\nGetty Images Owen Cooper repeated his recent Emmy and Critics Choice wins for his role in Adolescence\n\nBritish teenager Owen Cooper continued a year of adulation and awards acclaim for his performance in Adolescence, winning best TV supporting actor.

I'm still learning from the people that are sitting in front of you and sitting in front of me.\" And he still seems in disbelief at his meteoric rise, remarking: \"It's mad, what is going on?\" before signing off with the motto of his beloved Liverpool FC: \"You'll never walk alone.\"\n\nGetty Images Seth Rogen won best comedy TV actor for his leading role in Hollywood satire The Studio", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:13:40 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-12T09:17:54.166701"}

Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. \"She fought for things she knew were right\", her uncle told CNN. Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says.\n\nSources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported. Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA). The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA. Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult. Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene. \"It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young,\" the friend said. The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: \"From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother.\" They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as \"someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery\". \"Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature.

Swiss prosecutors have argued that Jacques Moretti, a French national, is a potential flight risk.

The sight of the newborn and her mother being winched to safety by helicopter amid the deluged landscape became one of the defining images of the Mozambique floods of 2000 – the country's worst ever. Reflecting on Rosita's life, President Daniel Chapo described her as a symbol for girls in the country.

It was very difficult. \"There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed. \"We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them.\" In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations.

Breaking the wall of silence between Iran and the rest of the world takes immense courage, given the risk of reprisals by the authorities. Omid, in his early 40s and whose name we have changed for his safety, has been protesting on the streets of a small city in southern Iran over the past few days against worsening economic hardship. He said security forces had opened fire at unarmed protesters in his city with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles. \"We are fighting a brutal regime with empty hands,\" he said.\n\nThe BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week. Since then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever. BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government. One of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations. Many people appear to have joined the protests on Thursday and Friday after calls from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution. The following day, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: \"The Islamic Republic will not back down.\" It appears that the worst bloodshed occurred after that warning as security forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps take their orders from him. Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and condemned \"terrorist actions\", state media reported.\n\nA young woman from Tehran said last Thursday felt like \"the day of judgement\". \"Even remote neighbourhoods of Tehran were packed with protesters - places you wouldn't believe,\" she said. \"But on Friday, security forces only killed and killed and killed. Seeing it with my own eyes made me so unwell that I completely lost morale. Friday was a bloody day.\" She said that, after Friday's killings, people were afraid to go out and that many were now chanting from alleys and inside their homes. Tehran was a battlefield, she said, with protesters and security forces taking positions and cover on the streets. But she added: \"In war, both sides have weapons. Here, people only chant and get killed. It is a one-sided war.\"\n\nMortuary videos shows violent government crackdown in Iran\n\nEyewitnesses in Fardis, a city just to the west of Tehran, said that on Friday, members of the paramilitary Basij force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) suddenly attacked protesters after hours without a police presence on the streets. The forces, who were in uniform and riding motorcycles, fired live ammunition directly at protesters, according to the witnesses. Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said. \"Two or three people were killed in every alley,\" one witness alleged.\n\nThose who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates. International news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18. Some local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands. The BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters. However, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as \"rioters\" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.\n\nEyewitness image Footage posted on Thursday showed large crowds in Babol, northern Iran\n\nEyewitness image Images posted on Thursday from Khorramabad in western Iran showed a man holding Iran's pre-revolutionary flag\n\nVideos verified by BBC Persian's fact-checking team also show police vehicles and some government buildings being set alight in different locations during the protests. Testimonies and video sent to BBC Persian are mainly from larger cities such as Tehran, nearby Karaj, Rasht in the north, Mashhad in the north-east, and Shiraz in the south. These areas have greater access to the internet via the Starlink satellite network. Information from small towns - where many early casualties occurred - is scarce as their access to Starlink is very limited. But the volume, consistency, and similarity of the accounts received from various cities point to the severity of the crackdown and the widespread use of lethal violence. Nurses and medics who spoke to the BBC said they had seen numerous dead bodies and injured protesters. They reported that hospitals in many cities had been overwhelmed and were unable to treat those with severe injuries, especially to the head and eyes. Some witnesses reported bodies \"stacked on top of each other\" and not handed over to families.\n\nEyewitness image / Reuters Footage from Tehran that emerged on Friday showed cars ablaze", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 19:54:32 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-12T20:32:24.606590"}

Now look what will happen to it', says unseen woman in a video\n\nFlames lick around the edges of Omar's passport. \"It's burning well,\" an unseen woman says in Russian in the video. Omar, a 26-year-old Syrian construction worker, had been deployed for about nine months on the front line of Russia's war in Ukraine when the clip arrived on his phone. He knew the woman's voice. It was Polina Alexandrovna Azarnykh, who he says had helped him sign up to fight for Russia, promising lucrative work and Russian citizenship. But now she was angry. In a series of voice notes from Ukraine, Omar, speaking under a pseudonym for his safety, describes how he ended up trapped and terrified in the war zone. He says Azarnykh had promised that if he paid her $3,000 (£2,227), she would ensure he stayed in a non-combat role. But, he says, he was sent into battle with just 10 days of training, so he refused to pay and she eventually responded by burning his passport. He says he tried refusing to take part in a mission, but his commanders threatened to kill or jail him. \"We were tricked… this woman is a con artist and a liar,\" says Omar.\n\nTelegram Polina Azarnykh frequently posts images of herself with new recruits, including the Syrian group Omar travelled with\n\nA BBC Eye investigation has followed how Azarnykh, a 40-year-old former teacher, uses a Telegram channel to lure young men, often from poor countries, into joining Russia's military. The former teacher's smiling video messages and upbeat posts offer \"one-year contracts\" for \"military service\". The BBC World Service has identified nearly 500 cases where she has provided documents, referred to as invitations, which allow the recipient to enter Russia to join the military. These have been for men - mainly from Syria, Egypt and Yemen - who appear to have sent her their passport details in order to enlist. But recruits and their relatives have told the BBC that she misled men into believing they would avoid combat, failed to make clear they could not leave after a year and threatened those who challenged her. When contacted by the BBC, she rejected the allegations. Twelve families told us of young men they say were recruited by her who are now dead or missing.\n\nTelegram Azarnykh frequently posts videos of herself encouraging people to serve in the Russian military\n\nDomestically, Russia has expanded conscription, recruited prisoners and offered increasingly generous sign-up bonuses to maintain its operation in Ukraine, despite substantial losses. More than one million of its soldiers have been killed or wounded since the full-scale invasion in 2022, with 25,000 killed in the month of December 2025 alone, according to Nato. Research by BBC News Russian, based on obituaries and other publicly available death records, suggests Russian troop losses in Ukraine rose faster than ever last year. It is difficult to determine how many foreigners have joined Russia's military. BBC Russian's analysis - which also looked at the number of foreigners killed and injured - suggests at least 20,000 may have signed up, including from countries such as Cuba, Nepal and North Korea. Ukraine has suffered significant troop losses too, and has also taken foreign fighters into its ranks.\n\n'Bodies everywhere'\n\nOmar's first contact with Azarnykh was when he was stranded with barely any money at a Moscow airport in March 2024, together with 14 other Syrians. Jobs in Syria were scarce and low paid. Omar says a recruiter there had offered the men what they understood to be civilian work guarding oil facilities in Russia. They flew to Moscow, only to learn they had been scammed. Searching online for options, Omar says, one of the group found Azarnykh's channel and messaged her. She met them at the airport within hours, and took them by train to a recruitment centre in Bryansk, western Russia, he says. There, he says, she offered them one-year contracts with the Russian army, with a monthly salary equivalent to about $2,500 (£1,856), and a sign-up payment of $5,000 (£3,711) - sums they could only dream of in Syria. Omar says the contracts were in Russian, which none of the men understood, and she took their passports, promising to arrange Russian citizenship. She also promised they could avoid combat roles if they paid her $3,000 (£2,227) each from their sign-up payments, he says.\n\nRoman Chop/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Omar described fierce fighting and frequent explosions on the front line\n\nBut, he says, within about a month, he was on the front line with, he says, just 10 days' training and no military experience. \"We're 100% going to die here,\" he says in one of his voice notes, sent to the BBC investigative team. \"A lot of injuries, a lot of explosions, a lot of shelling. If you don't die from the explosion, you'll die from the debris landing on you,\" he says in May 2024. \"Dead bodies everywhere… I've stepped on dead bodies, God forgive me,\" he reports the following month. \"If someone dies, I've seen it with my own eyes, they put him in a rubbish bag and throw him next to a tree,\" he adds. After nearly a year, he had discovered what he says Azarnykh had failed to explain - a 2022 Russian decree essentially allows the military to extend soldiers' contracts automatically until the war ends. \"If they renew the contract, I'm screwed - oh God,\" he says. His contract was continued.\n\n'Recruited from university'\n\nAzarnykh's Telegram channel has 21,000 subscribers. Her posts have often told readers wanting to apply to join the Russian military to send her a scan of their passport. She has then posted invitation documents, sometimes with a list of names of the men they are for. The BBC has identified more than 490 such invitations that she has sent over the past year to men from countries including Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. Her posts have mentioned recruitment for an \"elite international battalion\" and made it clear that people in Russia illegally - including those whose visas have expired - are eligible.\n\nOutside the UK, watch the film on YouTube.\n\nWe have spoken to eight foreign fighters including Omar who were recruited by her, as well as the families of the 12 men who are missing or dead. Many felt Azarnykh had misled or exploited recruits. They told us the men knew they were joining the military, but did not expect to serve on the front line. Several, like Omar, felt they had inadequate training or thought they would be able to leave after a year.\n\nWatch: 'Nothing happens for free' - says Azarnykh in a video in October 2024\n\nIn Egypt, Yousef - whose name we have also changed - told the BBC his older brother Mohammed, began a university course in Yekaterinburg in Russia in 2022. But he struggled to pay his fees, Yousef says, and told his family a Russian woman named Polina had begun offering him help online, including work with the Russian military that he believed would allow him to continue his studies. \"She promised him housing and citizenship… monthly expenses,\" he says. \"Suddenly he was sent to Ukraine. He found himself fighting,\" says Yousef. His last call was on 24 January 2024, Yousef says. About a year later, Yousef says a message arrived on Telegram from a Russian number, containing images of Mohammed's body. The family eventually learned he had been killed almost a year earlier.\n\n'Some lost their minds'\n\nAzarnykh became \"one of the most important recruiters\" for Russia's army, says Habib, another Syrian who has served in Russia's military. He was willing to be filmed but spoke under a pseudonym for fear of repercussions. Habib says he and Azarnykh \"worked together for around three years on visa invitations to Russia\". He gave no further details and we have not been able to confirm his role in the process. An image from social media in 2024 shows him alongside her. Azarnykh, who is from Russia's south-western Voronezh region, ran a Facebook group helping Arab students come to Moscow to study, before starting her Telegram channel in 2024.\n\nHabib told the BBC: \"Polina would take the men, knowing that they were going to die\"\n\nHabib says most foreign recruits arrived expecting roles securing facilities or standing at checkpoints. \"The Arabs who are coming are dying immediately. Some people lost their minds - it's hard to see dead bodies,\" he says. Habib says he met Omar and the group of Syrians at a military training site. \"She had promised them citizenship, good salaries and that they'd be safe,\" Habib says. \"But once you sign a contract here, there's no way you can leave.\" \"None of them knew how to use a weapon. Even if they were shot at, they would choose not to shoot back… if you don't shoot, you will be killed,\" he says. \"Polina would take the men, knowing that they were going to die.\" He says she \"received $300 (£223) from the army for every person she recruited\". The BBC could not confirm this, although other recruits also told us they believed she received payment.\n\n'Nothing happens for free'\n\nAzarnykh's posts from mid-2024 begin to note that recruits will be \"participating in hostilities\" and mention foreign fighters who have died in combat. \"You all understood well that you were going to war,\" she says in one video in October 2024. \"You thought that you could get a Russian passport, do nothing and live in a five-star hotel?... Nothing happens for free.\" In another case, in 2024, the BBC has heard a voice message sent by Azarnykh to a mother whose son was serving in the military. Azarnykh says the woman has \"published something horrible about the Russian army\". Using expletives, she threatens the son's life and warns the woman: \"I'll find you and all your children.\" The BBC made multiple attempts to contact Azarnykh. Initially she said she would do an interview with us if we travelled to Russia, but the BBC declined for safety reasons. Later, when asked in a voice call about claims that recruits were promised non-combat roles, she hung up. In voice notes sent afterwards, she said our work was \"not professional\" and warned of potential defamation proceedings. She also said: \"Our respected Arabs can stick their accusations up their arses.\" The BBC contacted the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence for comment, but received no response. Previously, in March 2022 President Putin backed the recruitment of men from the Middle East, insisting they were ideologically, not financially, driven: \"There are people who want to come voluntarily, especially not for money, and provide assistance to people.\"\n\nTelegram An image shared on Azarnykh's Telegram channel in January 2024 shows Habib standing next to her\n\n'Cash incentives'\n\nJournalists and researchers following the issue say individuals like Azarnykh are part of a web of informal recruiters. The BBC has found two other Telegram accounts in Arabic making similar offers for joining Russia's military. One includes posts showing invitation documents and lists of names, the other has advertised large sign-up payments for joining an \"elite battalion\". In September, Kenyan police said they had broken up a suspected \"trafficking syndicate\" that they said was luring Kenyans with job offers, but sending them to fight in Ukraine. Kateryna Stepanenko, a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of War, told the BBC some municipal and regional authorities in Russia have been offering cash incentives of up to $4,000 (£2,970) to individuals such as HR professionals and local residents who recruit Russians or foreigners into military service. She says the Kremlin initially used larger entities such as the Wagner private military group and prison system for recruitment, but since 2024 has also been \"leveraging locals and smaller companies\". This \"suggests to me that those earlier versions of recruitment are no longer generating the same number of recruits\", she adds. Meanwhile, Habib is now back in Syria after, he says, having bribed several commanders to terminate his contract. Omar eventually received Russian citizenship and has also managed to return to Syria. Two of the Syrians he served with are dead, according to their families. Azarnykh \"sees us as numbers or money - she doesn't see us as people\", he says. \"We won't forgive her for what she did to us.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:21:40 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-13T03:47:46.027010"}

They're now countering on an unprecedented scale - a ferocious security crackdown and near total internet shutdown has been unleashed on a scale unseen in previous crises. Some of the streets once engulfed by a roar of anger against the regime are now starting to go silent. \"On Friday it was extremely crowded - the crowd was unbelievable - and there was a lot of shooting. Then Saturday night it became much, much quieter,\" a resident of Tehran told BBC Persian. \"You would have to have a death wish to go out now,\" one Iranian journalist reflected. This time, an internal upheaval is also compounded by an external threat, with President Trump's repeated warnings of military action coming seven months after the US carried out strikes on key nuclear facilities during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, which left the regime weakened. But, to use an analogy often used by the American leader, that has also given Iran \"another card\" to play. Trump now says Tehran has called to go back to the negotiating table. But Iran doesn't have a good hand: President Trump says he may still have to take some kind of action before any meeting; talks won't take all the searing heat out of this unrest. And Iran won't capitulate to what have been the US's maximalist demands, including zero nuclear enrichment, which would cross red lines which lie at the very heart of this theocracy's strategic doctrine. Whatever the pressure of this moment, there's no sign Iran's leaders are changing course.\n\nMortuary videos shows violent government crackdown in Iran\n\n\"Their inclination is to clamp down, to try to survive this moment, and then to figure out where they go from here,\" says Vali Nasr from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, author of the book Iran's Grand Strategy. \"But given their straits with the US, with Israel, with sanctions, even if they quell these protests, they don't have many options to improve the lives of Iranians.\" This week may decide the momentum in this moment - whether Iran, and the wider region, is plunged into another bout of military attacks; whether brute force has completely put down these protests – as it has in the past. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told diplomats in Tehran today that \"the situation is now under total control\". Outside, in the bright light of day, the streets of Tehran were filled with the crowds the government called on to come out and reclaim the streets from protesters. Five days into a comprehensive communications blackout, a more chilling picture still sneaks out into the world through Starlink satellite terminals, Iranian technical creativity, and courage. Doctors' accounts of hospitals overwhelmed by casualties, grim videos of open-air mortuaries dotted by long lines of black body bags, voice notes sent to journalists at the BBC Persian Service expressing shock and fear. The numbers rise. In the last wave of unrest in 2022 and 2023, which lasted more than six months, around 500 deaths were recorded by human rights groups and more than 20,000 arrests. This time, within a few weeks, reports say the death toll already climbs far higher and more than 20,000 have been taken in so far. The government doesn't deny the bloodshed; state TV is also airing images of makeshift mortuaries, even admitting some protestors have been killed. The streets of Iran have been on fire. Government buildings have been set alight as anger burned. They are symbols of the system, but attacks on public property are condemned by the government as the work of \"terrorists and rioters. \" Legal language has also hardened in this time - \"vandals \" will be charged with \"waging war against God\" and face the death penalty. The government puts the main blame on foreign enemies - code name for Israel and the US - for an internal upsurge. This time, their accusation is also fuelled by the clear extent of infiltration by Israel's Mossad security agency during their 12-day war last year. With every new eruption of unrest in Iran, the same questions are asked: how far and wide do these protests reach; who's taking to the streets and squares; how will the authorities respond?\n\nAFP via Getty Images The authorities are trying to regain control in Iran following weeks of protests\n\nThis latest wave has been unique in many ways. It began in a most ordinary way. On 28 December, traders selling imported electronic goods in Tehran were jolted by the sudden currency collapse; they shuttered their shops, went on strike, and urged others in the bazaar to follow suit. The government's initial response was quick and conciliatory. President Masoud Pezeshkian promised dialogue and acknowledged \"legitimate demands\" in in a country where inflation soars near 50%, and currency depreciations play havoc with people's hardscrabble lives. A new monthly allowance, amounting to about $7 (£5), was soon deposited in everyone's bank account to help ease the pain. But prices shot up further; the wave of unrest swelled. Less than three weeks later, Iranians were marching everywhere - from small deprived provincial towns to major cities, chanting for economic and political change. There are no quick and simple fixes now; it's the system. Iran is broken by years of crippling international sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, deep seated rage over restrictions on social freedoms, and agony over the cost of this prolonged standoff with the West. But, so far, the centre appears to be holding. \"The most important element still missing from a full collapse is repressive forces deciding that they no longer benefit from, and are no longer willing to kill for, the regime,\" explains Karim Sadjadpour, a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington. Before this crisis erupted, the most powerful players in Iran's ruling circles were known to be bitterly divided on key issues: if and how to resume the ill-fated negotiations with the US over a new nuclear deal, as well as how to restore strategic deterrence after the blows to its military proxies and political partners during the Gaza war. But survival of the system, their system, matters above all else. Ultimate authority still rests with the ailing 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, but he's encircled by his most loyal defenders, among them the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), who now hold sway over the economy, politics and security of the Islamic Republic. President Trump's almost daily threats are known to have concentrated minds at the top. It has also provoked speculation far and wide over the impact of any outside intervention. Military action could bolster the protesters; it could also backfire. \"The primary impact would be to shore up elite unity and suppress fractures within the regime at a moment of heightened vulnerability,\" says Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.\n\nReuters Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's former shah, is among those calling on the US to intervene", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:53:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-13T03:47:46.187462"}

She insists she has not committed \"the slightest irregularity\".\n\nA high-stakes appeal by far-right French politician Marine Le Pen starts on Tuesday against a ruling that banned her from running for public office for five years.\n\nThe judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the \"heart of the system\" that saw the embezzlement of €2.9m (£2.5m) worth of European funds.\n\nLast year's case centred on charges that Le Pen, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, hired assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them.\n\nThe case at the Paris Court of Appeal will last until 12 February but a ruling is not expected before the summer, well ahead of next year's presidential vote.\n\nLe Pen was given a four-year prison sentence – with two years suspended and the remaining two to be served with an electronic tag rather than in custody.

The authors say the policies of the Trump administration didn't \"meaningfully impact\" the rise in emissions but they expect this to change in the coming years.\n\nIn the colder parts of the United States, most homes rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for their heating. The low temperatures experienced in early 2025 saw consumption of these fuels increase by nearly 7% compared with the previous year. Extra electric power was also needed by the boom in data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations in places like Texas and the Ohio Valley region. The rising demand for power combined with the higher cost of gas meant that coal use surged, rising by 13%. \"The grid decided to meet that additional load this year, in part with renewables, in part with fossil but because of higher natural gas prices, there was some fuel switching that saw marginally more coal than there was in 2024,\" said Michael Gaffney, from Rhodium Group, the report's lead author. Other observers see the high price of gas in the US as closely related to continuing large exports of gas to the rest of the world. \"Higher natural gas prices means that finally, coal, which had been kind of driven to extinction by low natural gas prices, well [gas is] now so expensive that coal's worthwhile again,\" said Jesse Lee, from Climate Power, a US-based environmental campaign group. \"And that's what is allowing coal to make this comeback.\" Since 2007 coal power generation in the US has shrunk by 64%, with last year's rise only the second in the last decade. Last year also saw a slowdown in the rate of coal plant retirements, as electricity companies delayed closures to meet demands. So is 2025 the start of the revival of coal? \"It's more than just a blip,\" said Michael Gaffney. \"This is a response to the demand growth in the sector, a lot of it is coming from data centres, cryptocurrency operations, other large load customers, and that demand growth is here to stay.\"\n\nGetty Images A giant data centre under construction in Texas\n\nSolar power also experienced a major growth spurt last year, rising by 34%, the fastest rate since 2017. Transport in the US, by road, rail and air remains the largest source of warming gases, with road traffic volumes increasing for the fifth year in a row. However, emissions from this sector were virtually flat in 2025 due to increasing numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles on the roads. Hybrids, in particular, showed strong growth, up 25% compared to 2024. While President Trump has been forceful in his determination to rollback the climate-related policies of his predecessor, and to boost US extraction of fossil fuel, Rhodium analysts who carried out this report say those changes made little difference in 2025. Some others disagree. \"There is a data centre explosion, that is somewhat independent of Trump,\" says Lee, of Climate Power. \"You could argue maybe his policies haven't all kicked in full blast yet, but I don't think you can really divorce his natural gas exports and his blind support of AI and data centres from this dynamic that's driving up emissions.\" Graphic by Mark Poynting", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:01:17 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-13T10:37:38.501620"}

The heads of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada are among 11 senior bankers who have signed a statement highlighting the importance of independence in setting interest rates. \"Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" they said.

As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has made personal comments, calling the Fed chair a \"major loser\" and a \"numbskull\". Commenting on the Fed chair, the global central bankers said in their joint statement: \"To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\" Until the weekend, Powell had stayed largely silent in the face of Trump's attacks but on Sunday, he publicly pushed back and warned that the independence of the US central bank was at stake. \"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said. In their joint statement on Tuesday, the senior financial institutions said: \"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. \"It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability.\" Powell, who Trump nominated as Fed chair in 2017 during his first term in the White House, is set to step down in May.

A court in Seoul heard closing arguments in Yoon's trial, in which he was accused of being the \"ringleader of an insurrection\". The charge stems from Yoon's attempt in December 2024 to impose military rule in South Korea - an act that lasted just hours but plunged the country into political turmoil. He was later impeached by parliament and detained to face trial. Yoon has denied the charges against him, arguing that martial law was a symbolic gesture to draw public attention to the wrongdoings of the opposition party.\n\nLeading an insurrection - the most serious charge against Yoon - carries the death penalty or life imprisonment and under South Korean law prosecutors must ask the judge for one or the other for the crime of insurrection. South Korea has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years. In 1996, former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was given the death penalty for seizing power in a military coup in 1979, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. The prosecutors in Yoon's case argue that although no one was killed in his martial law attempt, Yoon's intent was no less violent. They called to the stand the military commander who testified that Yoon had ordered the arrest of lawmakers. They also presented as evidence the memo made by one of the planners of the martial law, a former military officer, containing the suggestion of \"disposing\" of hundreds of people including journalists, labour activists and lawmakers. Yoon's insurrection trial has been merged with those of two other senior figures in his administration, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police chief Cho Ji-ho. A verdict and sentencing for Yoon and the other defendants, if they are convicted, is expected at a later date - widely expected to be in February.

Trump has called Somalis “garbage” and referenced unverified reports, amplified by Republican lawmakers, suggesting the militant group al-Shabaab in Somalia benefited from fraud committed in Minnesota, though these claims still have not been substantiated.\n\nYesterday, Minneapolis and St Paul filed a lawsuit against the administration, alleging the state was being targeted for its diversity and political differences with the federal government. “[Department of Homeland Security] agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general.

Trump says the US needs to \"own\" Greenland to defend against Russia and China. The White House has suggested buying the island, but not ruled out the use of force to annex it.

The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But Trump told reporters in Washington last week that a lease agreement was not good enough - the US \"had to have ownership\" and \"Nato's got to understand that\". At the news conference in the Danish capital Copenhagen, Frederiksen did not mince her words as she condemned the \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally\".

The Greenlandic prime minister said they were \"facing a geopolitical crisis\", but the island's position was clear: \"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,\" he said. \"One thing must be clear to everyone. Greenland does not want to be owned by the United States. Greenland does not want to be governed by the United States.

As Ernest Hemingway famously said about going broke – gradually then suddenly. The protesters in Iran and their supporters abroad were hoping that the Islamic regime in Tehran was at the suddenly stage. The signs are, if it is dying, it is still at gradual. The last two weeks of unrest add up to a big crisis for the regime. Iranian anger and frustration have exploded into the streets before, but the latest explosion comes on top of all the military blows inflicted on Iran in the last two years by the US and Israel. But more significant for hard-pressed Iranians struggling to feed their families has been the impact of sanctions. In the latest blow for the Iranian economy, all the UN sanctions lifted under the now dead 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed by the UK, Germany and France in September. In 2025 food price inflation was more than 70%. The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December. While the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die. Crucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression.\n\nIn the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out. At the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country. It has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy. A potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system.\n\nWest Asia News Agency via Reuters Iran's judiciary chief has vowed \"swift and harsh\" punishment for \"rioters\"\n\nThe IRGC has an auxiliary force, the Basij militia, a volunteer paramilitary organisation. It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters. I saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs. Behind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips. At dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too.\n\nThe seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger. In Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US. It is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible. As part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil. Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran? In Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response. An advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that it had so far confirmed the killing of 1,850 protesters, 135 people affiliated with the government and nine uninvolved civilians as well as nine children over the last 17 days despite an internet blackout. An Iranian official also told Reuters that 2,000 people had been killed but that \"terrorists\" were to blame. Trump said Iranian authorities would \"pay a big price\" for the killings and urged people to \"keep protesting\".\n\nHe has been weighing military and other options in response to the crackdown, having already announced 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran. The protests, which have reportedly spread to 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.\n\nHRANA said on Tuesday afternoon that, as well as confirming the killing of at least 2,003 people during the unrest, it was also reviewing reports of another 779 deaths. \"We're horrified, but we still think the number is conservative,\" Deputy Director Skylar Thompson told the Associated Press. Another group, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), meanwhile said it had confirmed the killing of at least 734 protesters. Its director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, told AFP news agency that the figures were \"based on information received from fewer than half of the country's provinces and fewer than 10% of Iran's hospitals\", adding: \"The real number of those killed is likely in the thousands.\" Reuters said the unnamed Iranian official who put the death toll at about 2,000 had not given a breakdown of the figure. However, it added, he said \"terrorists\" were behind the deaths of both protesters and security personnel.\n\nMortuary videos shows violent government crackdown in Iran\n\nIt is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country. However, videos posted online on Sunday showed people searching for the bodies of their loved ones at the Kahrizak Forensic Centre in Tehran. The BBC counted at least 180 shrouded bodies and body bags in the footage. Around 50 bodies were visible in another video from the facility shared on Monday. \"My friend went there [Kahrizak] to look for his brother, and he forgot his own sorrow,\" an activist told BBC Persian on Monday. \"They piled up bodies from every neighbourhood, like Saadatabad, Naziabad, Sattarkhan. So you go to your address pile and search there. You don't know a fraction of the level of violence that's been used.\" Hospitals in the capital have also reportedly been overwhelmed by the number of casualties. Prof Shahram Kordasti, an Iranian oncologist based in London, told the BBC's Newsday programme on Tuesday that the last message he had received from a colleague in Tehran said: \"In most hospitals, it's like a warzone. We are short of supplies, short of blood.\" Other doctors at \"two to three hospitals\" had also said they had treated hundreds of injured or dead people, he added.

MIGA!!!,\" he added, using the acronym for a US-based Iranian opposition slogan, \"Make Iran Great Again\". Trump's national security team was expected to hold a meeting at the White House on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran. On Monday night, US defence officials told the BBC's US partner, CBS news, that Trump had been briefed on a wide range of covert and military tools, including long-range missile strikes, cyber operations and psychological campaign responses. At the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera that Iran was ready for diplomacy but also for other options, including \"if the US wanted to test the military option which it had tested in the past\". In June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel. Araghchi also said that Iranian government had been in dialogue with protesters, but that it had been forced to take action after \"trained terrorist groups\" run from abroad infiltrated the demonstrations and targeted security forces. His comments echoed those of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who told supporters at state-organised rallies across the country on Monday that they had \"neutralised the plans by foreign enemies that were meant to be performed by domestic mercenaries\".\n\nEPA Supporters of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, protested outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Tuesday\n\nAlso on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest in response at what she called \"the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protesters\". The UN human rights chief Volker Türk urged Iranian authorities to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters immediately, his office said. He added that the labelling of protesters as \"terrorists\" to justify violence was unacceptable and that it was \"extremely worrying\" to see statements from Iranian officials indicating the possibility of the death penalty being used against protesters through expedited trials. Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday that those involved in the unrest would be \"dealt with seriously and severely\". And prosecutors have said some will be charged with \"enmity against God\", a national security offence that carries the death penalty. More than 16,780 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA. A 26-year-old man detained last Thursday has already been sentenced to death, according to his family and Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw. A relative of Erfan Soltani's family told BBC Persian that \"in an extremely rapid process, within just two days, the court issued a death sentence, and the family was told that he is due to be executed [this] Wednesday\". \"We have never witnessed a case move so quickly,\" Awyar Shekhi of Hengaw told the BBC. \"The government is using every tactic they know to suppress people and spread fear.\" Speaking to the BBC's US news partner CBS later on Tuesday, Trump said the US would take \"very strong action\" if Iran's authorities started hanging protesters. \"If they hang them, you're going to see some things...

Relatives of 26-year-old Erfan Soltani, who was detained last week, have told BBC Persian that he is due to be executed on Wednesday. A representative from the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights also told the BBC that they had \"never witnessed a case move so quickly\".

Awyar Shekhi, a representative of Hengaw, said that the case demonstrated that the Iranian government is \"using every tactic they know to suppress people and spread fear\". An Iranian official told Reuters that 2,000 people had been killed, but that \"terrorists\" were to blame. Trump earlier said he planned to attend a meeting at the White House on Tuesday night to discuss the situation in Iran, pledging to get \"accurate numbers\" on the death toll from the protests. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said that it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. Nearly 150 people affiliated with the government have also been killed, the group said. \"The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain,\" Trump told reporters while returning to the White House.

HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!,\" he added, using the acronym for a US-based Iranian opposition slogan, \"Make Iran Great Again\". Trump has been weighing military and other options in response to the crackdown, having already announced 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran. Iran's government has responded by accusing the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", warning that \"this playbook has failed before\". The protests, which have reportedly spread to 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Demonstrations escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA.\n\nIt is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country. However, videos posted online on Sunday showed people searching for the bodies of their loved ones at the Kahrizak Forensic Centre in Tehran. The BBC counted at least 180 shrouded bodies and body bags in the footage. Around 50 bodies were visible in another video from the facility shared on Monday. \"My friend went there [Kahrizak] to look for his brother, and he forgot his own sorrow,\" an activist told BBC Persian on Monday. \"They piled up bodies from every neighbourhood, like Saadatabad, Naziabad, Sattarkhan. So you go to your address pile and search there. You don't know a fraction of the level of violence that's been used.\"\n\nWatch: The BBC's Caroline Hawley says the Iranian regime now threatens protesters with execution\n\nHospitals in the capital have also reportedly been overwhelmed by the number of casualties.

The US Vice President, JD Vance, is hosting the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers, as well as their US counterpart, Marco Rubio, in the White House on Wednesday. The focus of the talks: the future of the world's biggest island, Greenland. There is a large digital news ticker tape running above the snow-covered shopping mall in the island's capital, Nuuk. You don't have to speak Greenlandic to understand the words \"Trump\", \"Greenland\" and \"sovereignty\" that appear over and again, in stark red letters. Donald Trump says he wants this country and he'll take it \"the easy way or the hard way\". After his recent controversial military action in Venezuela, people in Greenland are taking him at his word.\n\nReuters JD and Usha Vance toured a US military base in Greenland in March, 2025.\n\nThe anxious countdown to the Washington meeting has been going on for days. Passers-by tell me it feels like years. \"I would like to encourage (Donald Trump) to use both his ears wisely, to listen more and to speak less. We are not for sale. Our country is not for sale,\" Amelie Zeeb said, removing her chunky mittens, traditionally made here with sealskin and known as pualuuk, in order to wave her hands for emphasis. \"My hope is for our country to be independent and well-managed and not be bought,\" said Inuit writer and musician, Sivnîssoq Rask. While Maria, with her seven-week-old baby, wrapped snugly inside her winter coat, told me, \"I worry for the future of my young family. We don't want all this attention here!\" But international attention on Greenland is not going to disappear anytime soon. Far more hangs in the balance than the fate of this island alone.\n\nThe tussle over Greenland pits Nato nations Denmark and the US against one another. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. The Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that if the US takes control of the island by force, that will be the end of the transatlantic defence alliance that Europe has relied on for security for decades. It will also be another damaging blow to US-European relations, already badly bruised since Donald Trump's return to the White House. And remember: Europe's leaders are desperate to keep the Trump administration onside, to back a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine too. The potential ramifications of a fallout over Greenland are huge – but it is unclear how Washington intends to handle Wednesday's meeting. Will the spirit be one of compromise or confrontation? President Trump insists he needs Greenland for national security. If the US doesn't take Greenland, then China or Russia will, he says. Mindful of this, major European powers, who have vocally supported Danish sovereignty over Greenland, have also been scrambling to come up with military proposals to boost Nato's presence around the island and in the Arctic more broadly. The UK and Germany have taken the lead here, I'm told. \"We share the US concerns that this part of Denmark needs better protection,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday. \" We simply want to improve Greenland's security situation together.\" The chairman of the German Reservists Association, Patrick Sensburg, has called for at least one European brigade to be stationed in Greenland as soon as possible. He stressed that Germany would \"bear special responsibility in the endeavor\", and pointed out that the German army would gain strategic advantages by training soldiers in the challenging Arctic conditions. The British government is also in talks with European allies regarding the possible deployment of military forces to Greenland, particularly in response to perceived threats from Russia and China.\n\nWhat has Nato suggested in terms of security in the Arctic?\n\nTalks are at a preliminary stage. Troop numbers have not been defined but the discussions already include the possible deployment of soldiers, warships, aircraft, submarines and anti-drone capabilities in the region. One concrete suggestion is to form a maritime Nato \"Arctic Sentry\", mirroring the \"Baltic Sentry\" set up by alliance in the Baltic Sea after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The seabed of both the Baltic and the Arctic are busy with underwater infrastructure, such as energy pipelines and internet cables, critical for communications and billions of dollars worth of financial transactions daily. All vulnerable to hybrid attack. \"A lot more can be done in the Arctic,\" Oana Lungescu told me. Until 2023 she was Nato's longest-serving Nato spokesperson. She's now a Distinguished Fellow with the defence and security think-tank RUSI. \"I don't envisage that the UK or Germany will send a significant number of troops to Greenland, but they could hold more exercises in the region or expand existing ones. The UK and other Nato allies have already started deploying maritime assets for a big biannual Norwegian-led exercise in the High North, called Cold Response. The Arctic became a strategic priority for Nato after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But more needs to be done.\"\n\nGreenland sits between the US and Canada on one side and Russia and Europe on the other. Washington first got a real taste of Greenland's strategic value during the Second World War. The US occupied the island to stop it being taken by Nazi Germany after its invasion Denmark. The US tried to buy Greenland after the war but Copenhagen refused. Not long after, the two countries became founding members of Nato and in 1951 they signed a defence agreement, still valid today, allowing the United States to keep its military bases on Greenland and to bring as many troops to the island as it wished. Greenland is on the shortest route between continental US and Russia, which makes it key for missile defence. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US greatly reduced its presence here, keeping only one military base - Pituffik Space Base - one of Washington's most important radar stations.\n\nReuters US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland\n\nThe coastline here is particularly important. There is a maritime choke-point in the waters between Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK gap - that's viewed as crucial to keep an eye on Russian and Chinese ships, and especially submarines moving between the Arctic and Atlantic. The US had asked Denmark to boost its surveillance capacity. Copenhagen recently pledged $4 billion for Greenland security though the Trump administration has been dismissive. But will Nato proposals for a bigger, better Arctic presence be enough for the Trump administration? Julianne Smith was the US ambassador to Nato until President Trump's re-election; she is now the president of Clarion Strategies. \"This week's meeting is absolutely critical,\" she told me. \"I think it will be a turning point one way or another. The representatives from Denmark and Greenland are coming prepared. \"They are taking this moment very seriously, but the real question is whether any of these proposals will actually satisfy a White House that seems more determined and interested in expanding US territory than actually addressing the security of Greenland itself.\"\n\nIs this actually about security?\n\nIf security was really all that Donald Trump was concerned about, then the Pacific High North is a far more sensitive area of the Arctic for the US than Greenland, argues Ian Lesser, a Distinguished Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. That's where Russian and US presence and interests come into close contact, he told me. In fact, there are two small islands in the middle of the Bering Strait, where you could potentially walk from the United States to Russia in midwinter. Big Diomede is in Russia, and Little Diomede is in the US state of Alaska. But tensions have risen here since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The waters of the Bering Strait are key to Russia for the transit of strategic nuclear assets and American and Canadian fighter jets have repeatedly been forced to scramble to intercept Russian military planes off the Arctic coast. Ian Lesser believes Donald Trump's focus on Greenland, rather than Alaska, suggests more of an interest in economic security, rather than security in the traditional sense. But, he says, both could be dealt with without touching Danish or Greenlandic sovereignty: Nato could help boost security and defence, and the US could negotiate investment rights in Greenland. Greenland is rich in natural resources, including rare earths and minerals that the US and every other global power crave because of their importance to high-tech industries, including advanced defence technologies. Washington also has its eye on the potential for new, potentially lucrative shipping routes opening up as the Arctic ice melts.\n\nReuters Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen speaking at a press conference on 13 January in Copenhagen.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:11:22 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-14T06:49:47.654984"}

But the last three years were the world's warmest ever recorded, bringing the planet closer to breaching international climate targets. Despite natural cooling from La Niña, 2025 was still much warmer than temperatures even a decade ago, as humanity's carbon emissions continue to heat the planet. That will inevitably lead to further temperature records – and worsening weather extremes – unless emissions are sharply reduced, scientists warn.\n\n\"If we go twenty years into the future and we look back at this period of the mid-2020s, we will see these years as relatively cool,\" said Dr Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus. The global average temperature in 2025 was more than 1.4C above \"pre-industrial\" levels of the late 1800s - before humanity started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus and Met Office data.\n\nThe precise figures vary slightly between major climate groups, owing mainly to small differences in how the pre-industrial temperature is calculated. But there is no debate about the world's long-term warming trend. \"We understand very well that if we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the concentrations of those gases increase in the atmosphere, and the planet responds by warming,\" explained Prof Rowan Sutton, director of the Met Office Hadley Centre. Last year might not have been the hottest on record worldwide but extreme weather events linked to global warming continued. The Los Angeles fires in January and Hurricane Melissa in October were just two examples of extreme weather that scientists have found were likely fuelled to some extent by climate change.\n\nEgeder Pq Fildor / Reuters Global warming means that hurricanes like Melissa - which brought mass flooding to Haiti as well as devastation elsewhere in the Caribbean - can bring stronger winds and heavier rainfall\n\nThe continued warmth brings the world closer to breaching the international target to try to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. That was agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, with the aim of avoiding some of the much more severe consequences of climate change that 2C of warming would bring. \"Looking at the most recent data, it looks like we'll exceed that 1.5 degree level of long-term warming by the end of this decade,\" said Burgess.\n\nWhile long-term warming is the result of human activities, individual years can be slightly warmer or cooler because of natural variability. One such variable is the switch between the weather patterns El Niño and La Niña. They primarily affect weather in the Pacific but have a knock-on effect on temperatures worldwide. El Niño years tend to be warmer as a global average, while La Niña years are typically cooler. El Niño boosted temperatures in the world's warmest year, 2024, as well as to a lesser extent 2023. The return of La Niña conditions is thought to have suppressed warmth in 2025. But the fact that temperatures have remained so high in a La Niña year \"is a little worrying\", according to Dr Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth in the US. The last three years have seen global temperature records broken by significant margins. As the chart below shows, records for each month of the year have been set since 2023, according to Copernicus data.\n\nThe size of the jump in temperatures in 2023 surprised many scientists – sparking speculation about what might be behind the surge, in addition to carbon emissions and El Niño. Theories include changes to clouds and tiny particles called aerosols, which appear to be reflecting less of the Sun's energy back into space. The persistence of extreme warmth into 2025 \"suggests that there might be some mysteries that we haven't fully solved\", said Hausfather. \"We are seeing rapid warming at the upper end of our longer-term expectations,\" agreed Sutton. But whether the last three years have significiant implications for the longer term \"is not yet clear\", he added, with more data needed before making firm conclusions. While scientists expect more records to be broken in the years ahead, they emphasise that the future impacts of climate change are not set in stone. \"We can strongly affect what happens,\" said Sutton, \"both by mitigating climate change - that's by cutting greenhouse gas emissions to stabilise warming - and of course also by adapting, by making society more resilient to ongoing changes.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Jess Carr", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:44:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-14T07:31:43.688403"}

The train is not going anywhere but it is providing a vital service for dozens of people who have been left without power and basics like running water or heating. These are Ukraine's \"Invincibility Trains\", designed to boost public morale and provide some comfort as a bitter winter coincides with intensifying Russian attacks. In one of the carriages, Alina sits watching her infant son Taras playing with toys provided by international charities who help run the service. \"It's winter and it's rather cold outside,\" says Alina which is something of an understatement. With the effect of the wind-chill, temperatures this week in Kyiv have hit -19C. It is bitterly cold. \"I live in a new building on the 17th floor, but we have no elevator, no electricity and no water supply,\" says Alina. As Taras plays with his toys, she says it is also a relatively safe and comfortable place for her daughter to meet friends. It is also a welcome distraction for Alina, whose husband works all day in a factory, but she suddenly starts to stutter and weep as she tells me about her 54-year-old father who was killed at the front two years ago in a summer offensive near Bakhmut. As she regathers her composure, Alina says she will definitely come back here and welcomes the relief the train brings from the weather and the nightly Russian strikes.\n\nFor Alina and Taras, the train is a distraction from the hardship of daily life\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately exploiting the bitter winter to target power stations, energy storage facilities and other critical infrastructure. Kyiv's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, somewhat controversially this week also suggested that city residents, who could, should leave Kyiv to help ease pressure on critical resources. It was a comment seized upon by Russia as a sign of resignation and defeatism. But despite such obvious hardships, most people here in Kyiv remain stoic and are prepared to put up with them.\n\nFor Yulia Mykhailiuk, Ihor Honcharuk and their one-year-old son Markiian, that means heating building bricks on a gas stove to try to warm up the rest of their small apartment. The flat, in an old Soviet-era apartment block on the east side of the Dnipro river, is a temporary move because their own home was partially damaged in a Russian attack last August. \"We've had electricity today for something like four minutes,\" Ihor tells me. \"All of our charging stations and power banks have no energy left in them.\" \"For the first time in a while we have a real winter in Ukraine,\" says Yulia somewhat ironically. \"With this -12 to -16 cold and no heating, the apartment gets cold pretty soon.\"\n\nIhor and Yulia say they will leave Kyiv temporarily because of the energy crisis\n\nThe large batteries the couple have bought, like many city residents, to charge up when electricity does return are of no use when it comes to heating appliances because they run down so quickly. For now, dressing the baby up in multiple layers of clothing is the only solution, but Yulia says at the weekend they will heed Mayor Klitschko's call and temporarily move away from Kyiv to her parents' home outside the city, although she says it's a decision they have made for themselves and not because of pressure from the mayor's office. The energy crisis is not the only reason to move. Just across the courtyard from their new, temporary home, a recent Russian drone strike hit an apartment block, badly damaging several homes. Kyiv's problems are exacerbated by the fact it has borne so many Russian airstrikes against homes and critical infrastructure installations and, as home to more than three million people, the power shortages impact many people. The most recent Russian attacks against energy installations in the capital and other big cities have had a cumulative effect that is much worse than before. Klitschko said strikes on Monday night had caused the worst electrical outage the city had yet seen, and on Tuesday more than 500 residential buildings were still without power. \"Compared to all previous winters, the situation now is the worst,\" Olena Pavlenko, president of the Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group, told the Kyiv Independent website. \"Every time it's harder to recover. Everything is under ice, and repairs of cables and grids are now two to four times more complicated,\" she said.\n\nEngineers are working to locate and repair damaged cables\n\nAround the clock and across the city, engineers from private energy companies and the municipal authority are repairing power plants hit directly in Russian strikes or installations indirectly affected by them. On another bitterly cold morning we found hardy engineers using mechanical diggers and working with their bare hands to locate and repair damaged power cables which serve the huge multi-occupancy tower blocks on the river's east bank. The city authorities have repeatedly asked people and business not to use high-energy consumption devices because they use so much power, and when the electricity supply returns, the surge in demand for power causes the system to collapse – hence the damaged power cables we saw being repaired. But the engineer in charge here acknowledged it was a temporary fix. \"It will take years and years. We are currently working literally in emergency modes,\" says Andrii Sobko from Kyiv Electric Networks. \"The equipment is literally operating at its critical parameters so that at least the residents have light.\" As the war drags on, it's hard to find anyone in Ukraine who has not been directly impacted by the conflict.\n\nKyiv is enduring its fourth winter since Russia's full-scale invasion began", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:43:06 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-14T07:55:37.354525"}

Beijing on Wednesday reported the world's largest-ever trade surplus - the value of goods and services sold overseas compared to its imports - at $1.19tn (£890bn). It's the first time China's full-year trade surplus has passed $1tn, beating 2024's record figure of $993bn. China's monthly export surpluses passed $100bn seven times last year - a sign that Trump's tariff campaign have barely affected its overall trade with the rest of the world.\n\nTrade with the US did weaken, but this was made up for by a rise in Chinese exports elsewhere, especially to South East Asia, Africa and Latin America. Wang Jun, the deputy director of China's customs, said during a press conference on Wednesday that the figures are \"extraordinary and hard-won\" given the \"profound changes\" and challenges in global trade. He noted a rise in exports of green technology, artificial intelligence-related products and robotics. The huge surplus can be explained by strong overseas demand for Chinese goods as trade with global partners including South Asian countries and others in Africa and Europe grew, as well as a weak domestic market. China's economy has been weighed by a property crisis and rising debt, which has made businesses more hesitant to invest and consumers cautious about spending. As a result, there is less of a need to import goods, and imports rose by just 0.5%, according to the new figures. Meanwhile, a weaker yuan, a strong supply of goods and inflation in Western countries have also made Chinese exports more attractive. The results are a \"mixed blessing\" for Beijing, said trade policy analyst Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation. China has benefited from sales and more jobs created from its business abroad, but its goods could face \"greater scrutiny\" from foreign markets that are under pressure to compete with its products, she said. China's success will likely continue in 2026 as Chinese goods and services become more deeply entrenched into global businesses, said Elms. These latest figures will be seen in Beijing as a sign that China has customers all around the world, besides the US, but Wang warned that China faces an uncertain external environment.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:30:30 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-14T11:00:13.105644"}

Officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\". The BBC understands some UK military personnel are also being removed. A Qatari government statement said the measures reportedly being taken by the US were \"in response to the current regional tensions\". Trump earlier said the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if the authorities execute protesters. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US.\n\nAccording to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities.

The satellite technology has become a vital communications lifeline for some of those in the country trying to tell the outside world what has been happening on the ground in recent days. Two people in Iran told BBC Persian their device was running on Tuesday night even though they had not been keeping up with subscription payments. The director of an organisation that helps Iranians get online also told BBC Persian that Starlink had been made free. The satellite technology, which belongs to Elon Musk's SpaceX company, provides internet to tens of thousands of people in Iran, despite the fact it is illegal there. Since the internet was shut down, it has become one of the last, if not the last, remaining channels for Iranians to communicate with the outside world. The BBC has approached SpaceX to confirm it has waived the fee, but they are yet to respond.\n\nUsing the service in Iran carries a punishment of up to two years in prison and authorities have reportedly been searching for Starlink dishes to stop people from connecting to the internet. \"They're going onto rooftops and checking the surrounding buildings,\" says Parsa - not his real name - who spoke to BBC Persian using a Starlink connection. \"What people need to know is that the government is searching areas where a lot of footage has come out, so they need to be even more cautious,\" he says. The device operates like a mobile phone mast in space, using a constellation of satellites to communicate with small dishes on the ground with a built-in WiFi router. But the device is costly and beyond the means of many in Iran - so making it free may lead to its wider use.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera TV on Monday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet had been cut off \"after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country\". Iran's Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), claimed internet restrictions were imposed to stop foreign social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram being used \"to organise violence and unrest.\" Human rights groups have condemned the blanket blackout as an abuse of power and a spokesperson for the UN's Human rights office told the BBC the shutdown \"impacts the works of those documenting human rights violations.\" So far, one human rights group has confirmed the killing of more than 2,400 protesters during the unrest, as well as almost 150 people affiliated with security forces, although these numbers are believed to be much higher. It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country.\n\nGetty Images Starlink terminals, like the one pictured here, can allow users to connect directly to the internet via satellites, bypassing the blackout\n\nThe internet shutdown has also made it hard to gather and verify evidence of what is happening on the ground. \"I think a lot of people are connected, but only a very small number are taking the risk of sending information out,\" explains Parsa. According to human rights organisation Witness, at least 50,000 people are using Starlink to access the internet. Mahsa Alimardani, who works as its associate director for technology, threats and opportunities, says the Iranian authorities have tried \"aggressively jamming\" Starlink to stop people accessing the internet but it has not been successful. \"That's why they are resorting to physical confiscations,\" she adds. But those who are taking the risk are going to great lengths. One man who spoke to BBC Persian said he travelled almost 1,000km (620 miles) to a border area so he could use mobile networks of neighbouring countries to send video he recorded. The scene he witnessed - of a huge number of bodies lying on the ground at a forensic medical centre in Tehran - was so distressing that he felt compelled to share it, he told the BBC.\n\nThe Iranian government has a long track record of spying on its citizens, including digitally, to tighten its grip on society. Phishing techniques have reportedly been used to hack phones and access people's data and Iran's access to the internet is largely restricted to a domestic service that mimics a private intranet. Access to Western social media platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram is blocked, meaning Iranians have to use virtual private networks (VPNs) in order to access them. But despite this, Instagram is one of the most popular platforms in Iran, with an estimated 50 million users.\n\nBBC News\n\nThough some news is being shared online, experts say the Iranian government aims to control the narrative by limiting what information gets out.

President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting the harsh winter conditions as part of its war strategy, with overnight temperatures in Kyiv recently dropping to around -20C. The declaration comes as Zelensky's US counterpart Donald Trump said he was holding up efforts to secure a peace deal to end nearly four years of war with Russia. He told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Ukraine \"is less ready to make a deal\" than Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhen asked why peace talks have not yet resolved the conflict, Trump responded: \"Zelensky\".

The US and UK are both reducing the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, while officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal is a \"precautionary measure\". Iran's airspace was closed to nearly all flights for five hours overnight, with several airlines announcing that they will reroute flights around Iran. The Foreign Office has also temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, which will now operate remotely, a government spokesperson said.\n\nSpeaking from the White House on Wednesday, Trump said his administration had been told \"on good authority\" that \"the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions\". When questioned by a reporter, Trump said that \"very important sources on the other side\" had informed him of the developments, adding that he hoped the reports were true. Initial demonstrations over the collapse of the Iranian currency began in late December, but swiftly expanded into a wider crisis of legitimacy for Iran's clerical leadership. Trump had earlier threatened \"very strong action\" against Iran if the government executed protesters, after reports emerged that a 26-year-old man who had been arrested during the height of the demonstrations had been sentenced to death. Erfan Soltani was scheduled to be executed on Wednesday, his family had told BBC Persian. They later told the Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw that his execution had been postponed.\n\nAmnesty International\n\nIranian authorities have reportedly failed to give Soltani's family any more information about his case, citing only that he had been arrested in connection with a protest. The clothes shop owner was detained in the city of Fardis, just west of Tehran, last week. Responding to reports of potential executions, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said \"hanging is out of the question\" and there would be \"no hanging today or tomorrow\". Speaking to Fox News, he also warned the US president to \"not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,\" adding: \"If you try a failed experience, you will get the same result.\" In June 2025, the US bombed three of Iran's nuclear sites over fears Tehran could use them to build a nuclear weapon. In addition to the temporary closure of the British embassy in Tehran, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to \"exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region\".\n\nItaly and Poland have published statements urging their citizens to leave Iran, while Germany has issued a notice to air operators recommending that flights do not enter Iranian airspace, citing potential risk from \"escalating conflict and anti-aviation weaponry\". German airline Lufthansa issued a statement confirming its flights would avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace \"until further notice\". The US embassy in Doha has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to the Al-Udeid air base, while the Qatari government said it would continue to \"implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents\". Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East with about 10,000 personnel are based there, as well as around 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving.

Authorities have also arrested civil society members and suspended rights groups. On Tuesday, they shut down internet access and limited mobile phone services countrywide.\n\nThe actions have prompted fears of unrest around the polls, similar to the violence that followed the general election in Tanzania in October when hundreds of people were killed.\n\nObservers say the government’s reaction shows the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), is facing its biggest test yet, and the election risks further dividing Uganda.\n\nMuseveni is seeking his seventh term, and most Ugandans have not lived under another president. Younger people, in particular, have connected with Wine, a 43-year-old singer turned politician, and say they are concerned about their futures.\n\nView image in fullscreen Yoweri Museveni giving a speech at a rally to close his campaign on Tuesday. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nMuseveni became Uganda’s ninth president in 1986 after leading rebels in a five-year civil war. He led the country to economic growth and democratic change after years of political decay by autocratic governments.\n\nBut hopes of enduring change dwindled amid accusations of corruption, authoritarianism, repression and curtailment of judicial independence. Critics have also condemned his extended stay in office, achieved by using tactics to lengthen his term indefinitely including by twice changing the constitution.\n\n“[Wine’s] challenge has brought to the surface the character of the regime in terms of tolerating political alternatives or dissent,” said the political historian Mwambutsya Ndebesa. “The political class is getting more and more politically polarised. And that threatens the stability of the country because Uganda is prone to political instability.”\n\nIn the run-up to the election, which will also feature parliamentary votes, police and the military have frequently broken up Wine’s campaign events using teargas and gunshots and by bludgeoning his supporters. At least one person has been killed and hundreds have been arrested.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bobi Wine of the National Unity Platform, who is promising ‘a complete reset of Uganda’. Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters\n\nIn December, police detained Sarah Bireete, a rights activist and government critic who had raised concerns about discrepancies in the registry of voters. On Tuesday, the government ordered several rights groups that have denounced violations during the campaign period to stop their work.\n\nA report by the UN human rights office last week accused Ugandan authorities of using laws enacted or amended since 2021 to entrench repression and restrict rights ahead of the election, which it said would take place in an environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation.\n\nThe government has said the actions of the security forces are in response to what it termed lawless conduct by opposition supporters. In a televised address on New Year’s Eve, Museveni advised security forces to use more teargas to break up the crowds of “the criminal opposition”.\n\n“Everything is done to frustrate and annoy,” said the human rights lawyer Eron Kiiza at a briefing on the election last week, referring to disruptions of opposition events by security agencies. Kiiza was allegedly tortured and detained without trial last year while representing the jailed opposition politician Kizza Besigye, who has been in prison for 14 months over what critics say are politically motivated charges, and Besigye’s aide Hajj Obeid Lutale.\n\nMuseveni, 81, often credits NRM with bringing peace and development to Uganda. Under the slogan “protecting the gains”, he is promising wealth and job creation and to grow the economy partly through value addition for agricultural exports and oil production, which is expected to start this year.\n\nFestus Kezire, an NRM supporter in Serere district in eastern Uganda, said Museveni’s introduction of free primary and secondary education was one of the reasons he would vote for him. He said: “He has restored peace and stability in Uganda and this has helped end many years of civil strife.”\n\nMuseveni is campaigning against seven opposition candidates, the main challenger being Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, of the National Unity Platform (NUP). The two faced off in the last election in 2021, with Museveni winning with 58.38% of the vote and Wine garnering 35.08%.\n\nWine’s manifesto promises “a complete reset of Uganda”, including by upholding human rights and ending corruption.\n\nFlorence Naluyiba, an NUP supporter in Wakiso district in central Uganda, said she would vote for Wine because “Uganda needs change”. “Our dream is to have president who will prioritise social service delivery. Bobi Wine has taken the risk to stand up for Ugandans at the expense of his freedom.”\n\nNdebesa, the historian, said the incumbent’s stranglehold on state power, resources and infrastructure gave him organisational advantages over Wine. “The winning [of Museveni] in Uganda is almost a given,” he said.\n\nHowever, observers are keen to see what the election will say about Museveni’s eventual succession. He has long been thought to be grooming his son, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as his successor, although he has denied this.\n\nAcross Uganda, 21.6 million people have registered to vote.\n\nAdditional reporting by Samuel Okiror", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-15T05:32:06.863032"}

Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from. Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it. Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. \"Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back,\" she said. \"My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's.\" Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting via WANA via Reuters Iranian state television has shown this burnt-out bus, saying it was filmed in Tehran on 10 January\n\nMaryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown. The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks. It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night. Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground. Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as \"rioters and terrorists\" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.\n\nUser generated content Kashani, Tehran, on 8 January\n\nDemonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers. Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters.\n\nUser generated content A demonstration outside Hoze Elmiye religious institution, in Najaf Abad, on 8 January\n\n\"Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many,\" one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces \"mostly shooting at heads and faces\". The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities.\n\nIn Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was \"shot in the heart\" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member.\n\nFamily of Sorena Golgun Sorena Golgun's family say the 18-year-old university student was shot in his heart running from security forces in Tonekabon\n\nLike Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday. Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.\n\nNot all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday. The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran.\n\nThe scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.\n\nUser generated content Kashani, Tehran, on 8 January", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:35:49 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-15T05:57:16.382007"}

It was a heartbreaking sight.\" The crane involved in the accident was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with southwestern China via Laos. Many questions remain unanswered. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has called for an investigation, while the State Railway of Thailand has said it is suing the Italian-Thai Development Company - the firm in charge of the section of the railway where the incident took place.\n\n\"I'm still scared when I think about it... It was terrifying,\" said Penporn Pumjantuek\n\nThis is the same company responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake, when no other buildings in the city fell. Amorn Pimanmas, an engineering professor at Bangkok's Kasetsart University, believes that human, rather than natural, factors are the more likely cause of Wednesday's tragedy. Given that there were no storms, no flooding, and no significant vibration from the train passing underneath, \"natural causes can almost entirely be ruled out as the origin of the incident\", Amorn said. Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations. In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others. Meanwhile, over the past seven years, around 150 people have been killed in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.

Not an external danger, but one from within Afghanistan, which the Taliban seized control of as the previous government collapsed and the US withdrew in 2021. He warned of \"insiders in the government\" pitted against each other in the Islamic Emirate the Taliban set up to govern the country. In the leaked clip, the supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada can be heard giving a speech saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down. \"As a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end,\" he warned.\n\nAFP / Universal Images Group via Getty Supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada (centre) has \"absolute power\", his spokesman said - but ministers including Sirajuddin Haqqani (left) and Mohammad Yaqoob (right) have questioned decisions\n\nThe speech, made to Taliban members at a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar in January 2025, was more fuel to the fire of rumours which had been circulating for months - rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban. It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC. But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats. Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety. Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan. One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society. And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school. One insider described it as \"the Kandahar house versus Kabul\". But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested. After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged. Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.\n\nListen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leader\n\nIn late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world. Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why. But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on. \"The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent,\" explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established. \"Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada]. That's what made the act of turning the internet back on, against his explicit orders, so unexpected, and so notable,\" the expert said. As one Taliban insider put it: this was nothing short of a rebellion.\n\nA man of faith\n\nOnly two confirmed pictures of Akhundzada exist; this one, showing the supreme leader on the left, has been verified by BBC Afghan\n\nHibatullah Akhundzada did not begin his leadership like this. Indeed, sources say he was chosen as the Taliban's supreme leader in 2016 in part because of his approach of building consensus. Lacking battlefield experience himself, he found a deputy in Sirajuddin Haqqani - the feared militant commander, then one of the US's most wanted men with a $10m (£7.4m) bounty on his head. A second deputy was found in Yaqoob Mujahid, Taliban founder Mullah Omar's son – young, but bringing with him his Taliban bloodline, and its potential to unify the movement. The arrangement continued throughout negotiations with Washington in Doha to end the 20-year war between Taliban fighters and US-led forces. The eventual agreement, in 2020, resulted in the sudden and dramatic recapturing of the country by the Taliban, and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops in August 2021.\n\nLos Angeles Times via Getty Images The unexpected fall of Kabul in August 2021 saw thousands rush to the airport in the hope of being evacuated with US and other troops as they withdrew\n\nTo the outside world, they were a united front. But both deputies would find themselves quietly demoted to ministers as soon as the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Akhundzada now a lone power centre, insiders told the BBC. Even Abdul Ghani Baradar - the powerful and influential co-founder of the Taliban who had led negotiations with the US - found himself in the role of deputy prime minister instead of prime minister as many had expected. Instead, Akhundzada - having shunned the capital where the government sits in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban - began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners. Other loyalists were given control of the country's security forces, religious policies and parts of the economy. \"[Akhundzada], from the outset, sought to form his own strong faction,\" a former Taliban member - who later served in Afghanistan's US-backed government - told the BBC. \"Although he lacked the opportunity at first, once he gained power, he began doing so skilfully, expanding his circle using his authority and position.\"\n\nAkhundzada has filled his cabinet with loyalists in line with his vision, but those considered the \"Kabul group\" maintain their positions. Here, arguably the most influential members of each group are shown\n\nEdicts began to be announced without consultation with Kabul-based Taliban ministers, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education. The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the \"main sources of tension\" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December. Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming \"even more rigid\" in his religious beliefs. Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017. And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told. \"Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action,\" one current Taliban government official explained.\n\nTwo people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room. In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist. Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold \"regular consultations\", but now \"most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks\". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to \"travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation\". At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob. In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's \"consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar\". Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul. One analyst argues the result is that \"real authority has been transferred to Kandahar\" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC. \"All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,\" he said. However, \"from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power\", Mujahid added - saying \"to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final\".\n\nMen 'who have seen the world'\n\nAP Kabul (pictured) is the capital, and the seat of government for Afghanistan\n\nAmong the Kabul group, unhappiness was growing and alliances were strengthening. \"They [the Kabul group] are people who have seen the world,\" one analyst told the BBC. \"Therefore, they believe that their government, in its current form, cannot last.\" The Kabul group want to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state. They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women's education and employment.\n\nBut despite advocating for Afghan women to have more rights, the Kabul group is not described as moderate. Instead, insiders see them as \"pragmatic\", unofficially led by Baradar - the Taliban founding member who still commands great loyalty. He is also thought to be the \"Abdul\" referred to by Donald Trump as the \"head of the Taliban\" during a 2024 US presidential election campaign debate. In fact, he was the group's chief negotiator with the US. The Kabul group's shifting positions have not gone unnoticed. \"We remember that they [the Taliban leaders based in Kabul] used to destroy television sets, but now they appear on TV themselves,\" one analyst said. They also understand the power of social media. Former deputy Yaqoob - whose father led the Taliban during its first rule, when music and television were banned - finds himself increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, evident in gushing TikTok videos and merchandise adorned with his face. But no one has been more effective in rebranding themselves than his fellow former deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani. His ability to evade capture as his network orchestrated some of the most lethal and sophisticated attacks in the Afghan war against US-led forces - including a 2017 truck bombing in Kabul which killed more than 90 civilians near the German embassy - elevated him to near-mythical status among supporters. During this time, only one known photograph of him existed - taken by a BBC Afghan journalist.\n\nFBI The bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani - pictured in his wanted FBI poster, before the Taliban returned to power - was dropped last year\n\nBut then, six months after the US withdrawal, Haqqani marched out in front of the world's cameras at a graduation ceremony of police officers in Kabul, his face uncovered. It was the first step towards a new image: no longer a militant, but a statesman - one with whom the New York Times would sit down in 2024 and ask: is he Afghanistan's best hope for change? Just a few months later, the FBI would quietly drop the $10m bounty on his head.\n\nYet analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely. Arguably the most visible opposition to his edicts had been minor and limited - for example not enforcing regulations like the ban on shaving beards in regions controlled by Kabul group-aligned officials. But larger acts of rebellion have always been considered unthinkable. One former Taliban member emphasised to the BBC that \"obedience to [Akhundzada] is considered mandatory\". Haqqani himself, in his interview with the New York Times, played down any chance of an open split. \"Unity is important for Afghanistan currently so we can have a peaceful country,\" he said. Instead, one analyst said, the Kabul group is choosing to send \"a message to both the international community and Afghans\", one which says: \"We are aware of your complaints and concerns, but what can we do?\" At least, that was the case before the order came to shut down the internet.\n\nA breaking point\n\nAFP via Getty Images The internet switch-off began in carefully selected provinces and then expanded to the whole country in late September\n\nThe Taliban's supreme leader is a man with a deep distrust of the internet; he believes its content to be against Islamic teachings, and is so dedicated to his belief that an aide reads out the latest news or social media posts to him each morning instead, his spokesman once explained to the BBC. The Kabul group believe that a modern country cannot survive without it. The supreme leader's internet shutdown order began in provinces controlled by Akhundzada's allies, before it was expanded to the whole country. Sources close to the Kabul group and within the Taliban government described what happened next - an almost unprecedented moment in the Taliban's history. \"It surprised many members of the movement,\" one source said. In short, the Kabul group's most powerful ministers came together and convinced Kabul-based Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund to order it switched back on. In fact, the group had already made its unhappiness with the edict known before the internet was cut across the country: the group's de-facto leader, Baradar, travelled to Kandahar to warn one of Akhundzada's most loyal governors that they needed to \"wake him up\" - adding they had to stop being the supreme leader's \"yes\" men. \"You don't tell him the truth openly; whatever he says, you just implement,\" he was reported as saying by a Kandahar insider. His words, the source said, were dismissed. On Monday, 29 September, an order came into the telecommunications ministry directly from the supreme leader to shut everything down. \"No excuses\" would be accepted, a source in the ministry told the BBC. On Wednesday morning, a group of Kabul group ministers - including Baradar, Haqqani and Yaqoob - gathered at the prime minister's office, joined by the telecommunications minister. Here, they urged the Kandahar-aligned prime minister to take charge and reverse the order. According to one source, they told him the full responsibility lay with them. It worked. The internet returned. But perhaps more importantly, within those few days, it was as if what Akhundzada had hinted at in that speech months earlier had come to pass: insiders were threatening Taliban unity.\n\nAFP via Getty Images The decision to reverse the order took many by surprise - including Kabul group supporters\n\nBut why this order? One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education. Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price. In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from \"the path of God\" in \"committing injustice against 20 million people\" - a reference to the female education ban. UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025. But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power. Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together. As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk. Their positions come with power and an \"ability to make money\", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce. \"Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did,\" the expert points out. \"Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time.\"\n\nAP Beyond primary school, girls and women are denied an education under the Taliban\n\nAfter the internet was turned back on, speculation was rife about what would happen next. A source close to the Kabul group suggested the ministers will be slowly removed or demoted. However, the Kandahar insider suggested it might be the supreme leader who backed down \"because he fears such opposition\". As the year drew to an end, it appeared publicly that nothing had changed. The letter to the UN Security Council noted some UN member states \"have downplayed the division between leaders in Kandahar and Kabul as akin to a family dispute that would not alter the status quo; all senior leaders are invested in the success of the Taliban enterprise\". Zabiullah Mujahid, the senior Taliban government spokesman, has categorically denied any split. \"We will never allow ourselves to be divided,\" he told the BBC in early January 2026. \"All officials and leadership know that a split can be harmful for all, for Afghanistan, religiously prohibited and forbidden by Allah.\" However, he did also acknowledge that differences in \"opinion\" exist among Taliban members, but equated it to \"a difference of opinion in a family\". Half way through December, those \"differences\" had appeared to surface once more. Haqqani was filmed addressing a crowd in his home province of Khost during Friday prayers, warning that anyone who \"gets to power through the nation's trust, love and faith and then abandons or forgets the same nation... is not a government\". The same day, Akhundzada loyalist Neda Mohammad Nadem - the higher education minister - made his own speech to graduating students at a madrassa in a neighbouring province. \"Only one person leads and the rest follow orders, this is a true Islamic government,\" he said. \"If there are too many leaders then problems will emerge and this government that we have achieved will be ruined.\" After the dispute over the internet, these recent comments are set against a very different backdrop to those made by Akhundzada in the leaked audio at the start of 2025. Yet whether 2026 will be the year that the Kabul group move to make meaningful change for the women and men of Afghanistan is very much still up for debate. \"As ever… the question remains after apparent disagreement within the Emirate's top tier – will words ever lead to action?\" says one expert. \"They haven't yet.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 06:05:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-15T07:31:17.699384"}

But what might Venezuela's Machado ask for in return?\n\n15 minutes ago Share Save Norberto Paredes BBC Mundo, Caracas Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado may hold the Nobel Peace Prize, but she knows there is only one foreign endorsement that really matters: Donald Trump's. She will meet the US president at the White House on Thursday, after publicly offering to share her Nobel with him - a prize he has long coveted. Trump has said it would be an \"honour\" to accept the award, although the Norwegian Nobel Institute said legally it is not possible to transfer the prize. Previously, Trump had criticised the Nobel committee for bypassing him and giving Machado the award. Largely, he has appeared cool towards Machado, who was given the award in recognition of her long fight for democracy in Venezuela. In 2023, she won the opposition primary by a landslide, and was barred from running against Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election a year later was widely condemned as illegitimate. Yet after a US operation ousted Maduro earlier this month, Trump backed Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, saying Machado was \"not respected\" enough to lead the country. Now, she will be hoping to use her face time with the US president to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition. When BBC Mundo spoke to Machado after her most recent conversation with Trump – before the US intervened in Venezuela on 3 January – she told me that she thanked him for what he was doing \"for peace, freedom, and democracy\", insisting that together they would \"liberate\" Venezuela. But immediately after the US operation, Trump announced that he planned to \"run\" Venezuela himself and that he was content to keep Rodríguez's interim government in place, saying that she was \"essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump told reporters he had a \"great conversation\" with Rodríguez and praised her as being a \"terrific person\" following a long phone call. Could a meeting between Machado and Trump in the Oval Office change all that? Trump is famously unpredictable in his personal relationships with other politicians, but how he sees Machado's role is likely to depend less on what she says than on what Rodríguez does in the coming weeks, and whether it meets Trump's approval. While many opposition supporters were shocked when Trump sidelined Machado in favour of Rodríguez, some are now beginning to understand what may have been behind that decision. Machado is a polarising figure. Though loved by her supporters - who, among other things, admire her skill in uniting a previously fragmented opposition - she is hated by the regime and its loyalists for that very same reason. To them, she is a formidable and above all, outspoken opponent. While the government now commands only minority popular support, according to polls and analysts, it retains firm control over the state's institutions, including the military. Armed civilian groups known as colectivos, financed by the state, remain an integral part of the pro-government movement. In this political and security climate, expressing public support for Machado, or for US intervention, is fraught with risk. Even some of Maduro's opponents fear what could happen if Trump was to install an opposition leader without holding fresh elections. Venezuelans are divided on Trump's actions – even among those who opposed Maduro. While some whisper support, others take particular issue with his statements suggesting that the US could control Venezuela and its oil.\n\n\"It seems unjust to me\" - Views on Maduro's seizure from Caracas\n\nThe division over who should lead the country is deeper still. Many Venezuelans admire Machado and recognise her as the only opposition leader who maintained a coherent and consistent challenge to Maduro's government. Here in Caracas, some people have told the BBC that, contrary to Trump's claim, she enjoys strong support within the country. They point to her landslide victory in the opposition primary ahead of the 2024 presidential election and her ability to mobilise thousands of Venezuelans to protest when Maduro declared victory in the election, even though independently verified tallies showed the candidate backed by Machado had won. That group views Rodríguez as one of the architects of Maduro's government and its abuses. They will want Machado to press Trump at the White House on how the US plans to \"run\" Venezuela and to try and convince him that, while his promise to \"Make Venezuela Great Again\" by controlling the country's oil industry may appeal to some US Maga supporters, it does little to restore democracy. Others, however, agree with Trump and believe Rodríguez should oversee the transition. They view her as the best option to avoid the instability that could be triggered by a backlash from supporters of the current government and the colectivos. They would not welcome the opposition taking power after a US military operation in which Maduro was captured and sent to New York to face drug trafficking and arms charges. The army and the colectivos are currently unlikely to take orders from the opposition and, at least in the short term, some feel the status quo is safer.\n\nGetty Images Delcy Rodríguez, centre, has received Trump's blessing to lead the country after Maduro was seized", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:42:42 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-15T09:59:06.377200"}

Almost nothing is known about her state of health, or the conditions she is living in, although she is presumed to be held in a military prison in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. \"For all I know she could be dead,\" her son Kim Aris said last month, although a spokesman for the ruling military junta insisted she is in good health. She has not seen her lawyers for at least two years, nor is she known to have seen anyone else except prison personnel. After the coup she was given jail sentences totalling 27 years on what are widely viewed as fabricated charges. Yet despite her disappearance from public view, she still casts a long shadow over Myanmar. There are repeated calls for her release, along with appeals to the generals to end their ruinous campaign against the armed opposition and negotiate an end to the civil war that has now dragged on for five years. The military has tried to remove her once ubiquitous image, but you still see faded posters of \"The Lady\", or \"Amay Su\", Mother Su, as she is affectionately known, in tucked away corners. Could she still play a role in settling the conflict between the soldiers and the people of Myanmar? After all, it has happened before. Back in 2010 the military had been in power for nearly 50 years, brutally crushed all opposition and run the economy into the ground. Just as it is doing now, it organised a general election which excluded Aung San Suu Kyi's popular National League for Democracy, and which it ensured its own proxy party, the USDP, would win.\n\nAs with this election, which is still under way in phases, the one in 2010 was dismissed by most countries as a sham. Yet at the end of that year Aung San Suu Kyi was released, and within 18 months she had been elected an MP. By 2015 her party had won the first free election since 1960, and she was de facto leader of the country. To the outside world it seemed an almost miraculous democratic transition, evidence perhaps that among the stony-faced generals there might be genuine reformers. So could we see a re-run of that scenario once the junta has completed its three-stage election at the end of this month? A lot has changed between then and now.\n\nGetty Images Aung San Suu Kyi at her party's headquarters in Yangon on November 15, 2010, days after she was released\n\nBack then there had been many years of engagement between the generals and an assortment of UN envoys, exploring ways to end their pariah status and re-engage with the rest of the world. It was a more optimistic era; the generals could see their South East Asian neighbours prospering through trade with the Western world, and they wanted an end to crippling economic sanctions. They also sought better relations with the US as a counterbalance to their dependence on China, at a time when the Obama administration was making its celebrated \"pivot\" to Asia. The top generals were still hard-line and suspicious, but there was a group of less senior officers keen to explore a political compromise. It is not clear what finally persuaded the military leadership to open the country up, but they clearly believed their 2008 constitution, which guaranteed the armed forces one-quarter of the seats in a future parliament, would be enough, with their well-funded party, to limit Aung San Suu Kyi's influence once she was released. They badly underestimated her massive star power, and they underestimated how much their decades of misrule had alienated most of the population. In the 2015 election the USDP won just over 6% of the seats in both houses of parliament. In the next election in 2020 it expected to perform much better, after five years of an NLD administration which had started with impossibly high hopes, and had inevitably disappointed many of them. But the USDP fared even worse, winning just 5% of seats in the two houses. Even many of those who were dissatisfied with Aung San Suu Kyi's performance in government still chose hers over the military's party. This raised the possibility that she might eventually win enough support to change the constitution, and end the military's privileged position. It also ruled out the armed forces commander Min Aung Hlaing's hopes of becoming president after his retirement. He launched his coup on 1 February 2021, the day Aung San Suu Kyi was due to inaugurate her new government. This time there are no reformers in the ranks, and no hopes of the kind of compromise which restored democracy back in 2010. The shocking violence used to put down protests against the coup has driven many young Burmese to take up arms against the junta. Tens of thousands have been killed, tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed.

The crew's captain, Nasa astronaut Mike Fincke, exited the spacecraft first, smiling and wobbling slightly on his feet before lying down on a gurney, following normal procedures. Nasa's Zena Cardman, Japan's Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov followed, waving and beaming at cameras. \"It's so good to be home!\", said Cardman. It is the first time astronauts have been evacuated due to a health issue since the station was put into Earth's orbit in 1998.\n\nThe team, known as Crew-11, will now receive medical checks before being flown back to land after the splash down off the coast of California. In a news conference after splash-down, Nasa administrator Jared Isaacman said the sick astronaut is \"fine right now\" and in \"good spirits\". Judging by past Nasa communications about astronauts' health, it is unlikely that the identity of the crew member or details of the health issue will be released to the public. Control of the ISS has been handed over to Russian cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and two other crew members. The astronauts arrived on the ISS on 1 August expecting to complete a standard six and a half month stay. They were due to come home in mid-February. But last week, a scheduled spacewalk by Fincke and Cardman was called off at the last minute. Hours later, Nasa revealed a crew member had become ill. \"It's bittersweet,\" said Mr Fincke when he handed over the keys to the ISS to Kud-Sverchjov on Monday. In a social media post, he stressed that all crew members on board were \"stable, safe, and well cared for\". Orbiting Earth at an altitude of 250 miles, the International Space Station (ISS) makes 16 orbits of our planet a day, travelling at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour. It is run by five space agencies and carries out wide-ranging scientific research about space and the effects on humans, animals and plants of living in microgravity.\n\nWatch: Nasa Astronauts Medically Evacuated from ISS\n\nThe ISS carries some medical equipment and astronauts are trained to deal with minor medical issues, but it does not have a doctor on board. The evacuation was a serious test of Nasa's procedures for dealing with medical issues. By all accounts, it passed, although there may be questions about how well the agency could have responded if the astronaut had suffered a medical emergency. The early departure leaves the ISS with a skeleton crew of just three astronauts - Nasa's Chris Williams and cosmonauts Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev - until another four arrive in February. \"Despite all the changes and all the difficulties, we are going to do our job onboard ISS, performing all the scientific tasks, maintenance tasks here, whatever happens,\" Kud-Sverchkov said on Monday. He then issued his first command - a group hug.\n\nNASA Oleg Platonov, Mike Fincke, Zena Cardman and Kimiya Yui will end their ISS stay one month early\n\nThe incident is unprecedented in the history of the ISS, which has been permanently crewed for 26 years. Space missions have ended early due to health issues just twice before. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin and his colleagues returned four months ahead of schedule from a mission to the Salyut 7 space station due to a urological issue. And in 1987, a heart arrhythmia caused Soviet cosmonaut Aleksandr Laveykin to leave the Mir space station early. As more and more humans travel into space, including for tourism and a possible occupation of the Moon or even Mars, space experts say doctors will need to travel on missions.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:06:47 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-15T12:58:34.345087"}

The deployment, which will also include personnel from Germany, Sweden, Norway and the UK, comes as US President Donald Trump continues to press his claim to the Arctic island, which is a semi-autonomous part of Denmark. French President Emmanuel Macron said the initial troop deployment would be reinforced in the coming days with \"land, air, and sea assets\". Senior French diplomat Olivier Poivre d'Arvor saw the mission as sending a strong political signal: \"This is a first exercise... we'll show the US that Nato is present.\"\n\nThe movement of military personnel comes after Denmark and Greenland's foreign ministers travelled to Washington for a meeting with US Vice-President JD Vance on Wednesday. Following the meeting, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said while the talks were constructive, there remained a \"fundamental disagreement\" between the two sides and later criticised Trump's bid to buy Greenland. Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on his bid to bring Greenland under US control, telling reporters in the Oval Office, \"we need Greenland for national security\". Although he did not rule out the use of force, he said late on Wednesday that he thought something could be worked out with Denmark. \"The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela.\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland was not planning to join the European military deployment to Greenland, but warned that any US military intervention there \"would be a political disaster\". \"A conflict or attempted annexation of the territory of a Nato member by another Nato member would be the end of the world as we know it - and which for many years guaranteed our security,\" he told a press conference. Russia's embassy in Belgium meanwhile expressed \"serious concern\" at what was unfolding in the Arctic, accusing Nato of building up a military presence there \"under the false pretext of a growing threat from Moscow and Beijing\". However, the European Nato deployment consists of only a few dozen personnel as part of Danish-led joint exercises called Operation Arctic Endurance. While heavy in symbolism, it was not immediately clear how long they would stay. Germany was sending an A400M transport plane to Nuuk on Thursday with a contingent of 13 soldiers, although officials said they would stay in Greenland only until Saturday. Danish defence officials said they had decided with the government of Greenland that there would be an increased military presence around Greenland in the coming period to bolster Nato's \"footprint in the Arctic for the benefit of both European and transatlantic security\". Macron, in his new year address to France's armed forces, said Europeans had a special responsibility to Greenland \"because this territory belongs to the European Union and it's also one of our Nato allies\".\n\nThe US already has a military base in Greenland, currently staffed by up to 150 people, and has the option of bringing in far greater numbers under existing agreements with Copenhagen. But the Danish-led initiative is seen as signalling to the Trump administration that its European allies also have a stake in security in the Arctic and North Atlantic. Sweden's prime minister said Swedish army officers had been sent to Nuuk on Wednesday. Two Norwegians and one British military officer were also being sent. Downing Street said the UK shared President Trump's concern about \"the security of the High North\", and said the deployment involved \"stepping up with stronger exercising, to deter the Russian aggression and the Chinese activity.\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that defence and protection of Greenland was a common concern for the entire Nato alliance.\n\nWatch: What message do Greenlanders want to send to Trump?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:41:25 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-15T12:58:34.531487"}

So we are glad that at this point the study is being cancelled,” Boum said. The study was halted because it raised critical questions on the ethics of the trial, he said, adding: “The way the study was designed was a big challenge.”\n\nOfficials in Guinea-Bissau say the trial will still happen, according to one journalist on the press call. But Africa CDC officials said the trial would only move forward once it has been redesigned to address ethical issues. There were “still some conversations happening” between Guinea-Bissau officials and the US on how to conduct a trial like this ethically, and Africa CDC had assembled a team to make sure Guinea-Bissau officials “receive the adequate support to ensure that this study, if it has to happen, will also fit the ethical regulations”, Boum said.\n\nGuinea-Bissau, which underwent a coup in November, appears to have replaced all top officials, including at the ministry of health. Previous officials did not respond to media inquiries, and the number and email address for the health ministry appear to be disconnected.\n\n“The good guys won,” said Paul Offit, an infectious diseases physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a former member of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The cancellation news was “extremely heartening”, he said, adding that except for the birth of his children, he had “never been happier”.\n\n“This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable,” Offit said. “You can’t treat children like this, you can’t treat people like this. We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”\n\nThe HHS did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about why the trial was cancelled.\n\nThe news could represent a turning point for Guinea-Bissau and other countries where researchers are conducting work that critics say is unethical. It shows that “the institutions are getting stronger” by pushing back on unethical and exploitative studies in Africa, said Boghuma Titanji, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University who is currently studying vaccine misinformation in Africa.\n\nThe halt was “a win for advocacy and upholding the ethics of research”, said Titanji, who called the trial as it seems to be designed a “damaging” study. “It can lead to damage that lasts for several decades after the study has been completed,” said Titanji.\n\nThe researchers argued that the trial would make the vaccine available to 7,000 newborns when they would “not otherwise receive it”. But that means the other 7,000 children in the trial wouldn’t have access to the vaccine “due to the flip of a coin”, which would “knowingly deprive 7,000 children of a vaccine that could save their lives”, Offit said. Instead, he said, “take the $1.6m and vaccinate as many children as you can at birth”.\n\nAbout 18% of adults and about 11% of children under the age of one in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B. Children are much more likely to develop long-term effects, such as liver cirrhosis that can lead to cancer and death, if they catch the virus when they are very young.\n\nGuinea-Bissau currently recommends the hepatitis B vaccine to all babies at six weeks of age because of issues accessing the vaccine, but that recommendation will change to all newborns at birth in 2027 when more doses roll out.\n\nOffit likened the trial to the Tuskegee experiment, in which US researchers knowingly withheld an effective antibiotic from African American men suffering from syphilis.\n\nThe Danish researchers conducting the trial have also been criticized for not publishing the results of a study on the DTP vaccine, potentially because it contradicted their belief that the vaccine is dangerous, according to the Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård.\n\nThe protocols for the study have not been made public by the researchers or health officials, but a leaked version was published by Inside Medicine. Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer, one of the Danish researchers, also shared some details on social media. Titanji didn’t find his argument compelling. “It actually just raises even more concerns in my mind,” she said.\n\nThe researchers argue that live vaccines may bring nonspecific effects – improving overall health, not just against the disease the vaccine is targeting. But, they say, adding an attenuated vaccine like hepatitis B could interfere with these possible effects. Yet the evidence to support possible overall health effects is based upon the researchers’ prior research, which has been called into question.\n\nOther Danish researchers analyzed these studies and found no statistically significant effects, according to their new preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed or published yet. One of the researchers on that study, Anders Hviid, said on LinkedIn that these findings were especially important given recent decisions in the US to limit several vaccines for children.\n\nThe Danish researchers also argued that trials should be done in Africa in order to study their effects on African children.\n\nTitanji agreed that there needed to be more randomized controlled trials done in Africa on Africans, but said that they should be led by African scientists and powered by questions from Africans. Projects like the Danish study “basically exploit the scarcity of a proven beneficial vaccine in a context where that vaccine is needed”, Titanji said. The study, as it is currently designed, would be “exploiting a window where the government is not able to provide that intervention to its citizens”, Titanji said. “You are not solving the problem. You’re actually being part of the problem.”\n\nThe trial was slated to begin on 5 January. When reached last week about whether the trial had begun, the lead researchers, Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, disputed the Guardian’s previous story that cited ethical concerns.\n\n“That article was totally wrong,” Aaby said. “The report had virtually no evidence-based content about vaccines to transmit to the readers, only a lot of ethical condemnations from those who might potentially be questioned by the future results of the study.”\n\nAaby and other researchers on the project did not respond to further inquiries about the project’s cancellation.\n\nAaby and Stabell Benn, who are Danish researchers, have close ties with Trump administration health officials. Stabell Benn hosted a podcast with Tracy Beth Høeg, now an FDA official who has worked to find deaths after Covid vaccination and advocated for the US to slash vaccine recommendations to align with Denmark’s schedule.\n\nOn Joe Rogan’s podcast in 2023 Kennedy praised Aaby as a “very famous” researcher whose work showed the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine was deadly, he said – research Kennedy also cited when he ended funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. But he didn’t mention that the year before, in 2022, the researchers found completely different results when they conducted the same trial.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:26:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-15T15:38:12.660140"}

Multiple sources have told BBC Persian that bodies are being held in mortuaries and hospitals and that security forces will not release them unless their relatives hand over money. At least 2,435 people have been killed during more than two weeks of protests across the country. One family in the northern city of Rasht told the BBC that security forces demanded 700 million tomans ($5,000; £3,700) to release the body of their loved one.\n\nIt was being held at the Poursina Hospital mortuary, along with at least 70 other dead protesters, they said. Meanwhile in Tehran, the family of a Kurdish seasonal construction worker went to collect his body, only to be told they must pay a billion tomans ($7,000; £5,200) to receive it. The family told the BBC that they could not afford the fee and were forced to leave without their son's body. A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. BBC Persian has been told about a woman - who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. The woman then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body. She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. \"I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,\" she told her London relative.

{"title": "Votes being counted in Uganda election as opposition alleges rigging", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xn1yvgr4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "summary": "The election is a rematch between Bobi Wine and Yoweri Museveni, who has been president for 40 years.", "content": "Votes being counted in Uganda election as opposition alleges rigging\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Sammy Awami , BBC Africa, Kampala , Wycliffe Muia and Natasha Booty Share Save\n\nLong delays have frustrated voters in the capital and beyond\n\nVotes are being counted in parts of Uganda amid an internet shutdown and opposition accusations of rigging in presidential and parliamentary elections. \"Massive ballot-stuffing reported everywhere,\" declared presidential hopeful Bobi Wine in a post on social media, without providing documentary proof. The authorities have not responded to his allegations of electoral fraud, nor to his claim that \"many\" polling agents and supervisors belonging to his NUP party were \"abducted, and others chased off polling stations\". Delays of up to four hours have been blamed on malfunctioning biometric machines used to verify voters' identities.\n\nSome have linked the problems to the network outage - plus a lack of voting materials, and equipment not arriving at some stations on time. Polling stations therefore closed later than planned. The electoral commission says that anybody who joined the queue by 17:00 local time (14:00GMT) was able to cast their ballot. Earlier on, the electoral agency apologised for the \"technical glitches\" and said officials were working to resolve them. In the presidential race, Yoweri Museveni, 81, in power since 1986, is seeking a seventh successive victory as he faces a challenge from Bobi Wine, a charismatic 43-year-old pop star. The result of the presidential vote will be announced by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday, the electoral commission has said. Voting had finished by 18:00 local time in the polling stations in the capital, Kampala visited by the BBC, despite the delays. While data on turnout has not yet been published, this suggests that some people may have gone home without voting. However, others were determined to cast their ballots and there was widespread frustration at the problems in the morning. \"I'm angry because I have not voted up to now. We are meant to start at seven, but up to now [08:00] we haven't started. The ballots papers are not even there, I don't even know what to say,\" Kaweesi Ismail, a voter in Kampala, told the BBC.\n\nReuters The ballot papers were counted in front of large crowds at this polling station in Kampala\n\nElection chief Simon Byabakama ordered the use of the national voters' register where biometric machines failed to function. The problems appear to have affected both areas seen as pro-government as well as those thought to be opposition strongholds. Casting his vote in his native Rwakitura Village in the western Mbarara region, President Museveni said he had also experienced difficulties. \"I put my thumbprint on the machine but it did not accept it. However, my face was accepted instantly by the machine. The machine works,\" he said. Asked if he would accept the election outcome, the president said: \"This is one of the manipulations - we have to find out why, what was the problem?\" \"We are now verifying whether this was deliberate,\" he added.\n\nThe presidential poll is essentially a two-horse race between Museveni and Wine, but given the president has won the six previous elections, analysts say he is likely to further extend his time in power. Wine has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in the country. The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters. Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters, particularly those belonging to Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) party, of being disruptive. Internet access was suspended on Tuesday, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\". The NUP has rejected this explanation, accusing the regulator of trying to stop the opposition from mobilising and sharing evidence of election fraud. The party has launched an offline vote-monitoring app in case of a blackout. The app, called Bitchat, uses Bluetooth technology to share images of the results forms from polling stations and voting data without internet access, according to Wine.\n\nThe former leader of a guerrilla army, Museveni has benefitted from two constitutional amendments - removing age and term limits - that have allowed him to keep running for office. Wine, real name Robert Kyagulanyi, lost to the president in the 2021 elections, although Wine dismissed the results, alleging fraud. Alongside Museveni and Wine, six other presidential candidates are on this year's ballot papers. Voters will also chose a new parliament, with 353 seats up for grabs. For many of those voting on Thursday, the economy is the key issue. The majority of the population is under 30 and although the average income is steadily rising, there are not enough jobs for all the young people looking for work. There are also concerns about poor infrastructure and disparities in access to quality education and healthcare. During the campaign period, opposition supporters have faced escalating harassment, including arrest on politically motivated charges, according to both the United Nations and Amnesty International. Wine's rallies, unlike those of Museveni, have been disrupted by security forces. Amnesty has described the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings and other violent acts as \"a brutal campaign of repression\" ahead of the vote. In addition, the head of Uganda's electoral body told the BBC he has received threats warning him against declaring certain results.

The country's leadership – from Raul Castro to President Miguel Diaz Canel – were at the airport to receive the boxes carrying the cremated ashes of their \"32 fallen heroes\". In the lobby of the ministry building, each box was draped in a Cuban flag and set next to a photograph of the respective soldier or intelligence officer beneath the words \"honour and glory\". But despite the pomp and full military honours, this has been a chastening experience for the Cuban Revolution. First, it is believed to be the biggest loss of Cuban combatants at the hands of the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is. It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.\n\nGetty Images Some 32 Cubans were killed during the US military invention in Venezuela\n\nBut that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana. Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas. It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties. In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy. In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\". Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\" It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela. Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution. However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961. He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt: \"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\" \"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"\n\nVictor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:49:01 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T05:14:35.396363"}

Now, the practice of generations of women could become a lifesaving tool in the fight against malaria.\n\nResearchers in Uganda have found that treating wraps with the insect repellent permethrin cut rates of malaria in the infants carried in them by two-thirds.\n\nMalaria kills more than 600,000 people a year, most of whom are children in Africa under five years old.\n\nThe trial involved 400 mothers and babies aged about six months old, in Kasese, a rural, mountainous part of western Uganda. Half were given wraps, known locally as lesus, treated with permethrin and half used standard, untreated wraps that had been dipped in water as a “sham” repellent.\n\nResearchers followed them for six months to see which babies developed malaria, re-treating the wraps once a month.\n\nBabies carried in the treated wraps were two-thirds less likely to develop malaria. In that group there were 0.73 cases per 100 babies each week, and in the other there were 2.14.\n\nOne mother who attended a community session on the trial results stood up to tell the gathering: “I’ve had five children. This is the first one that I’ve carried in a treated wrap, and it’s the first time I’ve had a child who has not had malaria.”\n\nThe results had everybody “tremendously excited”, said co-lead investigator Edgar Mugema Mulogo, a professor of public health at Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda.\n\n“We suspected that there would be potential benefit – what was quite outstanding was the magnitude.”\n\nHis co-lead investigator Dr Ross Boyce, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was so astounded he said they should rerun the results to double-check them. “I wasn’t sure it was going to work, to be honest with you,” said Boyce. “But that’s why we do studies.”\n\nThe mosquitoes that carry malaria parasites generally feed at night, which is why bed nets have historically been so key in fighting the disease.\n\nView image in fullscreen A mural in a Ugandan orphanage. Mosquitoes have historically bitten people at night, so the fight against malaria has focused on bed nets. Photograph: Bella Falk/Alamy\n\nHowever, they are increasingly biting outside that time frame, in the evening or early morning, in what could be an adaptation to mosquito nets.\n\nMulogo said: “Before you go to bed, when you’re outdoors – particularly in the rural community, where the kitchens are outside, probably they have the evening meal outside – we also need to find a solution ensuring that we can prevent those bites likely to transmit malaria.”\n\nWraps are everywhere in those communities, he said, used not only for carrying infants but also as shawls, bed sheets and aprons. He would like to see treated wraps become part of the suite of tools used to tackle malaria in Uganda. Already there is demand in the communities that took part in the study, he said.\n\nHealth officials in Uganda and international malaria leaders at the World Health Organization have expressed interest in the research. It could help babies, as protection passed on through the mother’s antibodies wanes, often before they can be vaccinated.\n\nIt builds too on earlier research treating shawls in Afghan refugee camps that found a similar levels of success. WHO guidelines already recognise the role permethrin-treated clothing can play as individual protection against malaria.\n\nMulogo is hopeful there could one day be local production of impregnated wraps. “It presents a very good business opportunity for local industry.”\n\nThere are a series of steps that will need to be taken before any rollout, the researchers said, including evidence that the intervention works in other settings.\n\nBoyce said the insecticide has a good safety profile, and has been applied to textiles for years – including by the US military, where he first came across the idea when serving in Iraq.\n\nView image in fullscreen American soldiers’ uniforms are sprayed to prevent sandfly bites in Iraq in 2004. The US military has long applied insecticide to textiles. Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy\n\nBabies carried in permethrin-treated wraps were slightly more likely to develop rashes, at 8.5% v 6%, although none were sufficiently troublesome that they withdrew from the study. Boyce and Mulogo say further research will be needed to confirm the safety of the intervention, although any risks are likely to be outweighed by the benefits.\n\nBoyce would like to see whether treating school uniforms can also cut malaria rates. But he said there was no money for the next research stages “in the bank accounts quite yet”.\n\nHe is hopeful that the simplicity of the intervention will appeal to funders. “My mother can understand what we did. It’s not some specific inhibitor of a fusion protein or something like that. We took some cloth and we soaked it. And it’s dirt cheap,” he said.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:02 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T05:14:35.895770"}

Those who can afford to seek care abroad typically do so.\n\nThere is also a dearth of emergency response services. When the former world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua survived a car accident in Nigeria in December, he was helped at the scene by bystanders, with no ambulance in sight.\n\nAdichie’s sister-in-law Dr Anthea Esege Nwandu, a physician with decades of experience, has called for change.\n\nShe told Agence France-Presse: “This is a wake-up call, for we, the public, to demand accountability and transparency and consequences of negligence in our healthcare system.”\n\nAn exodus of medical personnel has exacerbated the situation, resulting in a doctor-to-patient ratio at the last count of 1:9,801. According to the health ministry, an estimated 16,000 doctors have left Nigeria in the last seven years.\n\n‘The will of God’\n\nAs Nigerians at home and abroad mourned Adichie’s son this week and the Lagos state government ordered an inquiry, stories flooded social media about a crisis of errors by medical personnel.\n\nIn Kano state, authorities said they were investigating the case of a woman who died four months after doctors left a pair of scissors in her stomach during surgery. The woman repeatedly visited the hospital complaining of abdominal pain, but was only prescribed painkillers. Scans revealed the scissors just two days before she died.\n\nFor Ijoma Ugboma, who lost his wife in 2021, the tragedy felt painfully familiar. Peju Ugboma, a 41-year-old chef, had gone into hospital for fibroid surgery and died due to complications exacerbated by staff putting “the wrong setting of the ventilator [on] for 12 hours”, her husband said.\n\n“Surgery on Friday, ICU on Saturday, dead on Sunday. I asked for the death certificate … but at that point I knew that I wasn’t going to let this thing go like that,” he told the Guardian.\n\nAlmost two years after Peju’s death, after a battle Ugboma said had tested him “mentally, emotionally and financially”, three of the four doctors in the operating theatre were indicted for professional misconduct.\n\nThe law firm of Olisa Agbakoba, a medical negligence lawyer with two decades’ experience, was one of two that represented the Ugboma family in court. He said in Nigeria there was no rigorous regulatory structure in place in the health sector.\n\n“There is no requirement for routine submission of reports, no systematic inspections, and no effective enforcement of professional standards,” he said.\n\nAgbakoba said his brother had undergone surgery by a physician who was not suitably qualified, resulting in sepsis that required a month-long treatment. “That was absolute incompetence,” he said.\n\nDespite the abundance of medical malpractice claims, formal complaints and lawsuits remain remarkably low, partly because negligence is hard to prove. But many say there is also a cultural and spiritual dimension involved.\n\n“People say it’s the will of God,” said Agbakoba. “They just go home and don’t talk about it … It’s underreported because many people don’t really do anything about it.”\n\nFinding justice\n\nEven when issues are escalated legally, medical personnel are reluctant to give professional opinions in court. Two of the three expert witnesses that testified for the Ugbomas live outside Nigeria.\n\n“People told us they’d read through the case notes, they’d seen all the fault lines … but nobody wanted to talk and that is part of the rot in the system because there’s an unwritten oath of secrecy,” Ugboma said.\n\nSome people are cautiously optimistic that the high-profile death of Adichie’s’s son will trigger an overhaul of the health regulatory framework.\n\nFor Ugboma, his long fight for accountability was worth it. “Right now, I can talk to my children and tell them I fought for their mother even in death,’ he said. “There’s justice out there if only one can persevere. It’s a marathon. But we can only have a better system if more people begin to challenge them.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:01 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T05:14:36.020803"}

{"title": "Israel moves Yellow Line deeper into Gaza, satellite images show", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxl6zkenqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "summary": "Israel placed and later moved control markers in three areas, with placed deeper inside Gaza than maps suggested.", "content": "Israel moves Yellow Line deeper into Gaza, satellite images show\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Benedict Garman , Emma Pengelly and Matt Murphy , BBC Verify Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nIsrael has moved the blocks which are supposed to mark its post-ceasefire line of control deeper into Gaza in several places, sowing confusion among Palestinians. Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that in at least three areas Israel placed blocks, before returning later and moving the positions further into the Strip. Under the terms of the US-brokered deal with Hamas, Israel agreed to withdraw troops beyond a line marked in yellow on Israeli military maps, which it has illustrated on the ground with concrete yellow blocks. Defence Minister Israel Katz warned in October that anyone crossing the Yellow Line would be \"met with fire\".\n\nSince these comments were made, there have been a series of deadly incidents around the line. In Beit Lahia, Jabalia and al-Tuffah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) placed blocks and later returned to move them deeper inside Gaza. In total, 16 positions were moved.\n\nIn the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, satellite images show that IDF troops moved at least seven already placed blocks between 27 November and 25 December. The position of the markers were moved on average 295m (968ft) deeper inside the Strip.\n\nAs well as the blocks that have been moved, BBC Verify mapped 205 other markers. More than half of those have been placed significantly deeper inside the Strip than the line marked on maps. An IDF spokesperson said it rejected \"all claims that the Yellow Line has been moved or its crossing by IDF troops\". \"The IDF is operating to visually mark the Yellow Line in accordance with the conditions on the ground and the ongoing operational situational assessment,\" they added. Analysis of satellite images up to 11 January suggests some sections of the Yellow Line - which the head of Israel's military described as a \"new border line\" - also remain unmarked on the ground more than three months since the ceasefire began. The latest satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that blocks have not been placed along roughly 10km (six miles) of territory - leaving some people in Gaza struggling to know where the beginning of what the IDF calls a \"dangerous combat zone\" is.\n\nLast month, one 23-year-old man near Khan Younis - whom the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said Israeli troops suddenly moved blocks near him beyond the mapped line, leaving him \"trapped\". \"We are now living inside the Yellow Line, [but] behind the yellow blocks, with no idea what our fate will be,\" he said. \"The atmosphere at night is terrifying. We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly.\" Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, has called the movement of the blocks a \"tool for territorial engineering\". \"By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border,\" he said. But Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they \"find it easier to place\".\n\nSeries of deadly incidents around the Yellow Line\n\nSince Katz's warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed. On 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there. Eyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said. An IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at \"suspicious individuals\" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals\". In another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December. \"The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him,\" he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident. And in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair had been gathering firewood for their disabled father when they were killed. Addressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops.

Researchers used satellite data and the physics of how Antarctica's glaciers move to work out what the continent might look like beneath the ice. They found evidence of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, and say their maps of some of Antarctica's hidden mountain ranges are clearer than ever before. While the maps are subject to uncertainties, the researchers believe the new details could shed light on how Antarctica will respond to climate change - and what that means for sea-level rise.\n\n\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News. Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery. In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet. But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made. \"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"\n\nTraditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks. But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps. “If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham. So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks. “It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. “And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.” While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.\n\n\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden. \"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\" One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.\n\nThe researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward. \"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping. \"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added. A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say. That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in a warming climate. And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science. “[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell.

China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade. He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.\n\nThe deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent month and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\". He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\". Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all. And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor. Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\"\n\nGetty Images Carney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi\n\nA trade reset\n\nTariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs. Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025. China is Canada's second-largest trading partner, recording more than C$118bn ($85bn; £63bn) in two-way merchandise trade in 2024. That's a long way behind the US, Canada's closest ally, which traded more than $761bn (£568bn) worth of goods with Ottawa in 2024. But economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney, who said ahead of his visit that Canada was focused on building a \"more competitive, sustainable and independent economy\" in the face of \"global trade disruption\". Carney, who arrived in Beijing on Wednesday, met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant. On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation. The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.\n\nA frosty history", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:41:05 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-16T10:57:52.811699"}

Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open. Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday. \"I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,\" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. \"They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\" He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them. \"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us. \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone. They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"\n\nIran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat. Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.

The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere. \"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said. \"My friends were there. We were constantly on the phone.

The 11-member delegation is due to meet MPs as well as Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen. The visit comes days after high-level talks in Washington failed to dissuade Trump from his plans. He insists Greenland is vital for US security - and that Denmark cannot defend it against possible Russian or Chinese attacks. Both Denmark and Greenland say they are opposed to a US takeover.\n\nGreenland is sparsely-populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two. Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. But Trump has said the US needs to \"own\" it to defend it properly. He has consistently offered to buy it off - an offer rejected by Denmark and Greenland - whilst mooting the possibility of seizing it by force. Denmark has warned that military action would spell the end of Nato - the trans-Atlantic defence alliance where the US is the most influential partner. Nato works on the principle that allies have to aid each other in case of attack from outside - it has never faced an option where one member would use force against another. European allies have rallied to Denmark's support. They have also said the Arctic region is equally important to them and that its security should be a joint Nato responsibility - with the US involved. To this end, several countries including France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have sent a limited number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission. French President Emmanuel Macron said \"land, air, and sea assets\" would soon be sent.\n\nWatch: Troops and vessels from European Nato allies arrive in Greenland\n\nThe US Congressional delegation includes senators and members of the US House of Representatives who are fervent supporters of Nato. It is led by Senator Chris Coons who said earlier this week that \"we need to draw closer to our allies, not drive them away\". Though Coons and the majority of the delegation are Democratic opponents of Trump, the group includes Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, too. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation to stop Trump seizing Greenland by force. A Republican congressman has also introduced a rival bill in support of the plan to annex the island. Trump's envoy to Greenland Jeff Landry told Fox News on Friday that the US should talk with Greenland's leaders, not Denmark. \"I do believe that there's a deal that should and will be made once this plays out,\" he said. \"The president is serious. I think he's laid the markers down. He's told Denmark what he's looking for, and now it's a matter of having Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio and Vice-President JD Vance make a deal. \"The United States has always been a welcoming party.

Ratcliffe and Rodríguez discussed potential economic collaboration and that \"Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries\", according to the US official. The meeting took place on the same day Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president, where she announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment - a move away from Maduro's policies.\n\nDuring her speech to the nation, Rodríguez said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically through political dialogue,\" adding Venezuela had to defend its \"dignity and honour\". President Donald Trump has said US oil companies will move into Venezuela and make money that will go to people there and to the US, with a top official saying the US would control sales of sanctioned Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\". Trump has asked oil companies to invest at least $100bn (£75bn) in Venezuela, but one executive said last week the country is currently \"uninvestable\". Rodríguez, the former vice-president, was sworn in on 5 January after US forces seized Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in an operation in Caracas. They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges. The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as \"historic\", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela. The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was \"very difficult\" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January. Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying \"we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour\". She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so \"walking on her feet, not dragged there\". She added that \"all of Venezuela is threatened\", and called for national unity to \"wage the diplomatic battle\".\n\nIn her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it. Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that \"foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing\" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads. Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat. \"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive,\" one man said. Rodríguez's reforms come as Trump and American investors eye opportunity in Venezuela, which holds the world's largest proven oil reserves. Bosses of the biggest US oil firms who attended a meeting at the White House last week acknowledged that Venezuela represented an enticing opportunity. But they said significant changes would be needed to make the region an attractive investment. Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate. \"You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela,\" he said. Trump also said that \"one of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices\". Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since crude oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago.

Gov Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both liberals, are facing an inquiry over statements they made about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. It comes as new details emerged in the death of a Minneapolis woman shot last week by an ICE agent in the city, which drew nationwide protests. Renee Good, 37, was found with at least three gunshot wounds and possibly a fourth to the head, according to official reports viewed by CBS.\n\nGovernor Walz responded on Friday to news of the inquiry against him by posting on X: \"Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic. \"The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.\" In a statement to the BBC, Mayor Frey said \"I will not be intimidated\". \"This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets,\" he said. The BBC has reached out to the justice department about the apparent investigation. The governor has urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully, but members of the Trump administration have accused him of inflammatory rhetoric, like describing ICE as a \"modern-day Gestapo\". Frey has demanded that immigration agents get out of Minneapolis. The inquiry is focused on a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 372, which makes it a crime for two or more people to conspire to prevent federal officers from carrying out their official duties through \"force, intimidation or threats\", a US official told CBS.\n\nProtests continued in Minneapolis on Friday after new details emerged about the death of Good, and local officials appealed for calm on the streets over this public holiday weekend. An incident report from the Minneapolis Fire Department, which was viewed by CBS News, said when they responded to the shooting scene last week, it appeared Good had been shot twice in the chest, once in her left forearm and a fourth wound, possibly from a gunshot, was seen \"on the left side of the patient's head\". Paramedics found Good unresponsive with an irregular pulse, and she was pronounced dead in the ambulance on the way to hospital, according to the report seen by CBS. The Trump administration has said that Good was impeding federal law enforcement and tried to run the agent over. Local officials say Good was a legal observer who posed no danger. Video of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is blocking traffic and parked in the middle of the street. An officer instructs her to get out of the car. As Good turns her wheel apparently trying to drive away, her Honda Pilot SUV pulls forward with one of the agents standing near the front of the vehicle. He pulls his gun and fires.\n\nReuters\n\nFootage from the scene shows the agent walking off afterwards. But Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have told CBS the officer suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident. No further details have been disclosed. The FBI is investigating the incident, although there is no federal civil rights inquiry into the agent who opened fire. Local officials and authorities say they have been shut out of the investigation. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump blasted demonstrators and local leaders on Friday. On Truth Social, he accused protesters of being \"highly paid professionals\", adding that Walz and Frey had \"totally lost control\". Later, the Republican president told reporters at the White House that he did not plan to invoke the Insurrection Act and send in troops to quell unrest in Minnesota, after earlier this week suggesting he might do so. \"If I needed it, I'd use it.

Pregnant women \"should feel reassured\" by the findings, they say, which contradict controversial claims from US President Donald Trump last year that paracetamol \"is no good\" and pregnant women should \"fight like hell\" not to take it. His views were criticised at the time by medical organisations worldwide. Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety. But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.\n\nThe US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol or a branded version called Tylenol - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy. Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research. Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't. The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\". The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link. \"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC. \"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added. This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller. Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says. \"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London. Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.\n\nMedical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women. Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\". \"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said. Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses. According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\". It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.\n\nGetty Images In a speech in September 2025, President Trump said his administration was linking paracetamol (or acetaminophen) to autism and urging pregnant women to largely avoid the pain reliever", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 00:13:47 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-17T02:12:55.377445"}

Cradled in the arms of their mother, Mafuko, the tiny twins clung to her body for warmth in the forest clearing in Virunga national park, in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nKatutu, head of gorilla monitoring in Virunga, has seen dozens of newborns in his 15 years as a ranger. But, he tells the Guardian, even he was touched by the sight of the fragile infant males, who face serious obstacles if they are to become silverbacks one day.\n\n“Watching Mafuko holding two babies was both moving and filled me with responsibility, given the twins’ extreme vulnerability,” he says.\n\nTwin births in mountain gorillas are extremely rare and present significant survival challenges Jacques Katutu\n\n“Twin births in mountain gorillas are extremely rare and always present significant survival challenges. We are cautious and vigilant, while also maintaining hope. The first four weeks are the most critical.”\n\nThe mother and her babies are being monitored daily since they were spotted on 3 January, with specialist vets on hand if the gorillas show signs of distress. The young males are healthy for now, rangers say, but the subspecies has high rates of infant mortality – with about a quarter falling victim to disease, trauma or infanticide.\n\nMafuko gave birth to twins in 2016, but neither survived more than a few days. The males have been born into the Bageni family, Virunga’s largest group of mountain gorillas, which now has 59 members. Despite the rangers’ caution, their arrival is another milestone in one of the greatest conservation success stories of the past century.\n\nView image in fullscreen The mountain gorilla twins. From barely 250 as they neared extinction in the 1970s, numbers of the subspecies have climbed to above 1,000 now. Photograph: Courtesy of Virunga national park\n\nBarely 250 mountain gorillas were left in the 1970s, split between two isolated territories in south-west Uganda and the Virunga massif mountain range, and many thought the animals faced extinction.\n\nDecades of intense conservation work saw population numbers surpass 1,000 in 2018 and the gorilla subspecies has since been downgraded from critically endangered to endangered by conservation authorities.\n\nBut the DRC section of Virunga mountain range remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for wildlife rangers. Over the past 20 years, more than 220 rangers have been killed in the park, where rebel groups such as M23 and other militias, as well as bandits, operate with impunity.\n\nMafuko is an example of the species’ resilience, say conservationists. Her mother was killed by an attacker when she was four but she has gone on to have several young, including the latest newborns.\n\n“Mafuko is an experienced mother. She is carrying both babies and is attentive to their needs. This is encouraging, although the situation remains delicate,” says Katutu.\n\n“We are closely monitoring the twins and mother – observing her breastfeeding and the overall health of the newborns. Allowing her to care for her babies naturally and minimising intervention is the priority.”\n\nSpecialist veterinary care has played a leading role in the revival of the species. In Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC, organisations such as the Gorilla Doctors have prevented dozens of deaths by helping animals affected by human behaviour, such as releasing gorillas accidentally caught in poachers’ traps. One study attributes half of the mountain gorillas’ population increase to the vets.\n\nKatutu says that neither infant will be named until their survival looks more certain. But for now, at least, the signs are promising.\n\n“Initial observations show that they are calm and maintain good contact with their mother. Their behaviour is consistent with newborns in a good condition, while remaining very vulnerable,” he says.\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield in the Guardian app for more nature coverage", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 06:00:19 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-17T06:38:45.292277"}

The final result is expected to be declared later on Saturday. Wine has condemned the \"fake results\" and \"ballot stuffing\" but has not provided any evidence. The authorities have not responded to his allegations. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday morning, police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said Wine was still in his home and that Wine's family members were spreading \"untrue\" and \"unfounded\" claims. He said Wine's movements were restricted because his home was an area of \"security interest\". \"We have controlled access to areas which are security hotspots,\" Uganda's Daily Monitor paper quoted him as saying. \"We cannot allow people to use some places to gather and cause chaos. All our actions are intended to prevent anybody from creating violence or destabilising our security,\" he said. Overnight Wine's son, Solomon Kampala, posted updates on social media admitting he was getting conflicting reports about the security situation at his parents' home. Difficulty accessing the internet in the country has made it hard to verify information. Just after midday local time (09:00 GMT), Wine posted a statement on Facebook explaining that it had been \"very difficult\" at his home in Kampala's Magere district on Friday night.\n\n\"The military and police raided us. They switched off power and cut off some of our CCTV cameras. There were helicopters hovering over. \"I want to confirm that I managed to escape from them. Currently, I am not at home, although my wife and other family members remain under house arrest,\" he said, adding that the nationwide internet shutdown had added to speculation about events. \"Given the commotion that happened at our house at night, and given that no-one is allowed to access the house, our neighbours concluded that they had succeeded in abducting us and spread the news.\" The campaign has been marred by violence and on Friday, news emerged that at least seven opposition supporters had been killed overnight on Thursday in disputed circumstances in Butambala, about 55km (35 miles) south-west of the capital. The US embassy then issued an alert to its citizens because of reports the security forces were \"using tear gas and firing into the air to disperse gatherings\".\n\nAnadolu/Getty Images Police on Friday were pictured dealing with pockets of demonstrators in Kampala\n\nDuring Thursday's vote, voting was delayed by up to four hours in many polling stations around the country as ballot boxes were slow to arrive and biometric machines, used to verify voters' identity, did not work properly. Some have linked the problems to the network outage. Election chief Simon Byabakama said on Friday that the vote counting had not been affected by the internet blackout and the final results would be out before 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Saturday. President Museveni, 81, is seeking a seventh term in office. He first took power as a rebel leader in 1986. Wine, a 43-year-old pop star-turned-politician, says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30. He has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in Uganda, a country with a history of conflict. Although there are six other candidates, the presidential poll is a two-horse race between Museveni and Wine. The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters. Rusoke, the police spokesperson, dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive. Internet access was suspended on Tuesday, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".\n\nGetty Images/BBC", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:05:54 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-17T11:22:15.813046"}

There are still several unknowns - namely who else might be added, and the exact structure of what is currently a rather complicated layout. So far, no Palestinian names are included on the two separate senior boards that have been officially unveiled. One is a \"founding Executive Board\", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, called the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority. But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.\n\nAjay Banga, president of the World Bank, is something of an exception as a dual-national, Indian-born US citizen, but the only other is the former UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, whose inclusion is likely only to further fuel those same concerns. Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region. Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: \"Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine.\" Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue. \"I've always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he's an acceptable choice to everybody,\" the president said last October.\n\nThere is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both. But the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It will be headed by the former Bulgarian politician, Nickolay Mladenov, who's been given the title of High Representative for Gaza.\n\nYakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus is the only Israeli member. In its statement announcing the names, the White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\". And whatever the concerns and complexities, the plan remains the only game in town, with many world leaders pledging their support and commitment to helping make it a success.\n\nIts architecture is further complicated by the fact that, sitting above all the structures announced so far, will be the Board of Peace itself, with President Trump as the chairman. Names of that supreme body have not yet been announced, but the current UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Canadian leader Mark Carney have reportedly been invited to join. In the end, whether the most vocal critics can be assuaged will depend on how quickly the new members of the senior teams can begin to drive change that makes a real difference in both daily life for Palestinians and, crucially, further concrete steps towards a lasting peace.\n\nGetty Images Aid groups have accused Israel of continuing restrictions on their work\n\nMajor challenges remain to both of those goals. The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter. While aid groups say there has been some improvements, they accuse Israel of imposing continuing restrictions upon their work. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts. Showing meaningful progress towards rebuilding will also be a Herculean task, involving not only the removal of an estimated 60 million tonnes of rubble, but first finding and disposing of the dead bodies and unexploded bombs contained within it. Perhaps the biggest challenge though is maintaining the fraying ceasefire itself.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the move was \"completely wrong\" while French President Emmanuel Macron called it \"unacceptable\". Swedish PM Ulf Kristersson said: \"We won't let ourselves be blackmailed.\" The comments came after Trump announced a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would come into force on 1 February - and could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached. Mr Trump insists the autonomous Danish territory is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday in protest at the proposed US takeover. Greenland is sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.

They have argued that the security of the Arctic region should be a joint Nato responsibility. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have dispatched a small number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission. Announcing the new tariffs in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump said those countries were playing \"a very dangerous game\". At stake, he said, was the \"Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet\". He said the proposed 10% levy to be introduced next month on goods exported to the US would rise to 25% in June and remain \"payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\". In his response, Starmer said: \"Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.\" France's Emmanuel Macron said: \"Tariff threats are unacceptable in this context... We will not be swayed by any intimidation.\" Ulf Kristersson said: \"Sweden is currently having intensive discussions with other EU countries, Norway and the United Kingdom to find a joint response.\" European Council President Antonio Costa stated: \"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law... which of course begins within the territory of the member states of the European Union.\" Meanwhile, Denmark's foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the threat had \"come as a surprise\".\n\nReuters Trump has recently escalated his drive to acquire Greenland\n\nTrump has often mused that \"tariff\" is his favourite word, and he has made clear that he views it as something of a blunt instrument with which to convince – or coerce – countries around the world to align their policies with the desired outcomes of the White House. But his announcement represents a significant escalation in his recently rekindled drive to acquire Greenland, despite their opposition. It is unclear what immediately prompted the tariffs announcement, which Trump first hinted at while speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday. While in recent weeks he has repeatedly said that a variety of options – including the potential use of military force – remained on the table, the announcement comes just days after US and Danish officials agreed to set up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island. In Washington's diplomatic and political circles, that announcement was seen by many as a \"best-case\" scenario for Denmark and its European allies – one that would, at the very least, delay any decision or further escalation from the White House. Instead, the latest tariffs have injected a newfound sense of urgency into the issue and strained relations with important Nato allies and trading partners.\n\nEPA Protesters in Copenhagen waved Greenland's white and red flag in support of self-determination\n\nOpinion polls suggest 85% of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the US. Demonstrations against Trump's takeover plans were held in Danish cities as well as in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Saturday - before the tariff announcement. In the Danish capital, Copenhagen, placards were held up reading: \"Hands Off Greenland\" and \"Greenland for Greenlanders\". \"We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland's right to self-determination,\" said Camilla Siezing, heads of Inuit, an umbrella group of Greenlandic associations. In Nuuk, Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen joined protesters holding signs reading \"Greenland is not for sale\" and \"we shape our future\" as they headed for the US consulate. The rallies coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as \"not constructive\".", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 21:19:46 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-17T21:42:18.391052"}

Over almost 12 hours, the 98m-tall Space Launch System was carried vertically from the Vehicle Assembly Building on the 4-mile (6.5km) journey to the pad. Now it is in position, the final tests, checks - and a dress rehearsal - will take place, before the go-ahead is given for the 10-day Artemis II mission that will see four astronauts travel around the Moon. Nasa says the earliest the rocket can blast off is 6 February, but there are also more launch windows later that month, as well as in March and April.\n\nReuters The Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will fly the Artemis II mission to the Moon\n\nThe rocket began moving at 07:04 local time (12:04 GMT) and arrived at Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center at 18:41 local time (23:42 GMT). The rocket was carried by a huge machine called a crawler-transporter, travelling at a top speed of 0.82 mph (1.3 km/h) as it trundled along. Live coverage captured the slow-moving spectacle. Nasa said the rocket will be prepared over the next few days for what it calls a \"wet dress rehearsal\" - a test for fuel operations and countdown procedures. The Artemis II crew - Nasa's Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen - were at the Kennedy Space Center watching the rocket as it was moved. In just a few weeks, the four astronauts will be strapped into a spacecraft, perched on the top of the rocket, ready to blast off to the Moon. It will be the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 landed on its surface in December 1972.\n\nNASA From left to right the Artemis crew is Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen\n\nNasa said the mission could take its astronauts further into space that anyone has been before. Artemis II is not scheduled to land on the Moon, but will instead lay the groundwork for a future lunar landing led by the Artemis III mission. Nasa said the launch of Artemis III will take place \"no earlier than\" 2027. But, experts believe 2028 is the earliest possible date. Koch said it was an amazing feeling to see the rocket. \"Astronauts are the calmest people on launch day. And I think... it feels that way because we're just so ready to fulfil the mission that we came here to do, that we've trained to do,\" she said. Hansen said he hoped the mission would inspire the world. \"The Moon is something that I've taken for granted. I've looked at it my whole life, but then you just glance at it and glance away,\" he said. \"But now I've been staring at it a lot more, and I think others will be joining us and staring at the Moon a lot more as there will be humans flying around the far side and that is just good for humanity.\"\n\nBefore Artemis II heads to the Moon, the first two days of their mission will be spent in orbit around the Earth. \"We're going to be going into an orbit almost right away that is 40,000 miles out - like a fifth of the way of the Moon,\" Koch told BBC News. \"We will have the Earth out the window as a single ball, something none of us have seen in that perspective. \"And then we're going to travel a quarter of a million miles away… we're going to do a lot of science and operations along the way.\" While they fly around the far side of the Moon, the crew will have three hours dedicated to lunar observation - to gaze, take images and to study its geology, which will help plan and prepare for a future landing at the Moon's south pole.\n\nNASA The European Service Module provides power and propulsions and life support systems\n\nA key part of the Orion spacecraft that the astronauts will be flying in was made in Bremen in Germany. The European Service Module, which sits behind the crew capsule, is the European Space Agency's contribution to the mission and has been built by Airbus. \"The European Service Module is so important - we basically can't get to the Moon without it,\" says Sian Cleaver, a spacecraft engineer at Airbus. \"It provides the propulsion that Orion needs to get us to the Moon.\" Its large solar arrays will generate all the electrical power for the craft, she adds. \"We've also got these big tanks full of oxygen and nitrogen, which are mixed to make air, and also water, so that we can provide everything that the astronauts need in the crew module to keep them alive on their journey.\"\n\nKevin Church/ BBC News Sian Cleaver from Airbus says the safety of the astronauts is the top priority\n\nInside their cleanroom, the team is busy building more modules for future Artemis missions. Each one takes about 18 months to put together but has taken thousands of engineering hours to design. Everything on board has to work perfectly. \"We've got to get those astronauts to the Moon and then back again, completely safely,\" says Cleaver.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 01:22:46 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-18T04:00:14.676903"}

In their midst was former nationalist leader Alain Orsoni, 71, who had flown in from exile in Nicaragua to bury his mother. Suddenly, with the ceremony under way, a single shot was fired from nearby scrubland, killing Orsoni instantly. Thirty-five people have been fatally shot on this island of 350,000 people in the past three years alone, giving it one of France's highest murder rates. Corsicans have become wearily familiar with vendettas and tit-for-tat underworld shootings, but even here, the way Orsoni was killed has stunned islanders. Yesterday, Alain Orsoni was cremated after a funeral service in Ajaccio. There was a large police presence.\n\nDelmarty via Getty Images Behind the beauty of Corsica's capital Ajaccio lies the shadow of organised clan violence\n\nClose friend Jo Peraldi finds it hard to believe that a day of high emotion surrounding the funeral of Orsoni's mother could have been defiled in such a way. \"A cemetery is sacred in Corsica, just like a church. Never have I witnessed seeing someone murdered while accompanying their mother to their final resting place,\" he told Corsican radio. Peraldi had seen his friend on the morning of the funeral. Like Orsoni, he had been an active figure in Corsican nationalism, spending 15 years in jail for organising bomb attacks against symbols of the French state. Over the years, victims of Corsica's violence have included farmers, elected officials, a lawyer, local business owners and even the president of the chamber of commerce.\n\nAFP In this killing in 2012, a chamber of commerce leader Jacques Nacer was killed as he locked up his clothes shop\n\nBut for a cousin of the victim, Christian Leca, Orsoni's killing was \"a tipping point in the horror\". \"People don't kill in cemeteries, it's intolerable,\" he told Le Monde newspaper. The nature of the violence has changed in recent times, says Thierry Dominici, an expert of Corsican nationalism at the University of Bordeaux who grew up on the island. \"Once armed groups gave up their violent campaign for autonomy or independence, they kept their weapons and turned to organised crime instead,\" he told the BBC. \"The French state was so focused on tackling the separatists that it turned a blind eye to their lucrative criminal activities.\" But he believes there is a significant difference between Corsica's organised crime and the role of the mafia in parts of southern Italy. \"In Corsica the clans are not linked by family ties or rituals of lifelong loyalty, but by simple opportunism,\" Dominici says.\n\nJudges in Paris specialised in tackling organised crime are running the investigation into Orsoni's shooting alongside the regional prosecutor's office in Marseille. \"This murder increases the mafia pressure that weighs heavily on Corsican society,\" says Gilles Simeoni who, as president of Corsica's regional authority, holds the island's highest elected position. \"Orsoni was a major contemporary figure in Corsican nationalism both out in the open and and in the shadows.\" His killing has reverberated far beyond Corsica. The Orsoni family are a household name on the island and they have been long linked to nationalism as well as episodes of violence. In his younger years, Alain Orsoni spent time in jail for bomb attacks aimed at putting pressure on the French state to grant the island more autonomy. But the nationalist movement split into different groups and increasingly turned to money laundering, extortion, protection rackets, drug trafficking and violence to win lucrative state-run contracts. Orsoni's brother, Guy, was killed by a rival clan in 1983 and his son is in jail for drug trafficking and attempted murder. He narrowly escaped being killed several times and fled to Central America at the height of one of the particularly violent feuds, turning his attention instead to investing in casinos. He knew his life was in constant danger. I saw it first-hand when I spent two days with him back in 2012 for the BBC.\n\nAFP Orsoni made a number of high-profile signings at AC Ajaccio\n\nA big football fan, he had moved back from Central America to run one of the local football clubs AC Ajaccio. Under his presidency, AC Ajaccio were even promoted to the top flight of French football, Ligue 1. Big signings were made during the club's heyday, including former Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. When I asked Orsoni how he managed to attract star players despite having the smallest budget in Ligue 1, he cracked a smile: \"Corsica is a nice place to play and I guess I am quite persuasive.\" At the time, he wore a bullet-proof vest and was driven around in an armored car with tinted windows. Rather than sit in a grand office with big windows overlooking the beautiful Bay of Ajaccio, the club president worked in a windowless, concrete bunker deep inside the building. When I suggested we go for a tour of the town, he categorically said no, it wasn't safe. He was renowned for his good looks and sing-song southern accent, as well as a passing resemblance to the late actor and showman Yves Montand. But his easy going smile could suddenly turn to an eerie silence. When I asked him if his reputation as the godfather of Corsica was true, he replied: \"Yes, I'm the godfather, but only to my grandchildren.\" As we talked, surrounded by tough-looking men in leather jackets, boots and jeans, I attempted to crack a joke that fell flat. After a long, uneasy pause, Orsoni broke the silence with a chuckle and his henchmen followed suit.\n\nAFP Alain Orsoni was compared in both looks and voice to late actor and singer Yves Montand", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 00:08:38 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-18T07:57:18.783313"}
{"title": "'Digital isolation': Will Iran's internet shutdown become permanent?", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5gegrdq3go?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "summary": "Internet monitor FilterWatch warns that authorities are trying to cut the country off from international connectivity.", "content": "'Digital isolation': Will Iran's internet shutdown become permanent?\n\n30 minutes ago Share Save Joe Tidy , BBC cybersecurity correspondent and Farshad Bayan , BBC Persian Share Save\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nIran is 10 days into one of the most extreme internet shutdowns in history, with 92 million citizens cut off from all internet services and even disruption to phone and text messaging. The Iranian government cut off services on 8 January, apparently to stifle dissent and prevent international scrutiny of a government crack down on protesters. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet was cut off in response to what he described as externally directed \"terrorist operations\". The government has not said when internet services will return, but new reports suggest that, behind the scenes, the authorities may be making plans to restrict it permanently. On 15 January, the news website IranWire reported that government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told journalists that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March. Internet freedom observers at FilterWatch believe the government is hastily implementing new systems and rules to cut Iran off from the international internet. \"There should be no expectation of reopening international internet access, and even afterwards, users' access to international internet will never return to its previous form,\" FilterWatch said, citing unnamed government sources. While the BBC cannot independently verify this report or the timing of its implementation, journalists who spoke to BBC Persian also said they were told that internet access would not be restored anytime soon.\n\nFrom temporary outage to \"communication black hole\"\n\nIran has maintained a tight grip over the internet for many years, with most western social media apps and platforms blocked, as well as external news websites like BBC News. However many people have managed to access popular apps such as Instagram using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Internet freedom campaigners at Access Now say Iran has consistently used shutdowns as a way to mask mass violence and brutal crackdowns on protesters, as seen during the nationwide internet shutdowns during the November 2019 and September 2022 protests.\n\nKentik Based on Kentik's traffic data, the increase in inbound data flow into Iran (shown by the dotted line in the lower‑right corner) began at 3:42 a.m. local time on Jan 17th. However, the current level of connectivity remains extremely limited, amounting to only about 0.2% of the traffic volume recorded before the January 8 Internet shutdown.\n\nA shutdown was also imposed during the Iran-Israel conflict in June 2025. However, the current blackout has lasted longer than any previous shutdown. In a public statement, the charity Access Now said that full restoration of internet access is imperative. \"Restricting access to these essential services not only endanger lives but embolden authorities to conceal and evade accountability for human rights abuses,\" it said. Already there are reports that livelihoods in Iran are being badly impacted by the shutdown with e-commerce particularly affected. As of 18 January, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) estimates that more than 3,300 confirmed protester deaths have been recorded, with more than 4,380 cases under review. It also reports that the number of arrests has reached 24,266 across 187 cities. The real number of people killed and detained is believed to be significantly higher, but the lack of access means the figures cannot be independently verified.\n\nInternet monitoring project, FilterWatch, says that the latest shutdown spells the start of a more extreme \"digital isolation\" and increased surveillance on what is said, sent and viewed online. Amir Rashidi, director of cyber security and digital rights at the Miaan Group, which runs FilterWatch, told the BBC he believes the authorities are moving towards a tiered system in which access to the global internet would no longer be automatic but subject to approval. Access would be granted through a registration and vetting process, he expects, adding that the technical infrastructure for such a system has been in place for years.\n\nWho decides about the Internet?\n\nAccording to FilterWatch, the plans are not being spoken about publicly, with key decisions increasingly concentrated within security bodies rather than civilian ministries. Protecting Iran from cyber attacks - of which there have been many high profile and disruptive cases in recent years - may be another motivation for the extreme moves.\n\nHowever, analysts caution that the plans may not fully materialise or could be applied unevenly due to internal power dynamics and broader economic and technical pressures. Amir Rashidi notes that risks to internet providers, alongside users' ability to adapt or migrate to alternative platforms, could further complicate implementation.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images The shutdown is affecting the livelihoods and daily activities of most Iranians\n\nIf Iran goes ahead with the plans being reported on, it will be following similar systems in Russia and China. China has led the world on internet control not just with enormous state censorship over online discussion but also with what people are able to access abroad. The so-called Great Chinese Firewall blocks citizens from much of the global internet and all western apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are not reachable without VPNs - but they are also becoming harder to use. In 2019, Russia began testing for a grand plan to create a similar system dubbed Ru-net. But unlike China, which built state control into the internet as the web spread decades ago, Russia is having to retrofit state control into complex systems. Russia is going a step further than China and planning to switch itself off from the world wide web with a \"kill switch\", which will apparently be used at times of crisis. The system will allow internal internet traffic and keep the country moving online but without traffic going outside or in - a digital border in effect. But it has yet to be fully tested.\n\nWhere is internet in Iran heading?\n\nIf the reports are accurate, it seems that Iran is planning to a quasi combination of permanent Chinese and Russian internet control. \"In Iran there seems to be a move to isolate everyone from any electronic access, unless approved by the government,\" said computer security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University in the UK, after reviewing the reports of Iran's plans. He believes the Iranian regime has probably moved ahead with its longer term plans, using the current blackout as a reason to make the technical switches and orders now, whilst everything is cut off. Amir Rashidi says the question is no longer technical, but political - arguing that whether such systems are fully implemented now depends on political will.\n\nMobina / Getty Images", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 09:56:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-18T10:28:15.525368"}

That withdrawal followed talks with US officials.\n\nThe Omar facility and nearby gas fields are under army control after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) pulled back, officials and monitors say. Earlier the army captured the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.\n\nOn Friday, in an apparent good-will gesture, al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language and make the Kurdish new year an official holiday.

Trump says he will impose new taxes on eight US allies - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK - in February if they oppose his proposed takeover of the autonomous Danish territory. He insists Greenland is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force - a move that has drawn widespread criticism. The countries threatened with tariffs have now issued joint statement, saying Trump's plan risks a \"dangerous downward spiral\".\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations,\" they said, reiterating that they \"stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland\". The countries stressed they are \"committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest\" as members of the Nato military alliance. \"We stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement reads. Separately, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook: \"We want to cooperate and we are not the ones seeking conflict. And I am happy for the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed.\" \"It is all the more important that we stand firm on the fundamental values that created the European community.\" It came as EU members held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland, which would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached. \"These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,\" he wrote, adding: \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security and Survival of our Planet\". The US president insists Greenland is critical for US security and has said previously that Washington would get the territory \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\". Greenland is a sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News' Meet the Press that \"Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the US, and it will not need to be defended if it is part of the US\". \"I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States,\" he said.\n\nIt is still unclear how the tariffs will affect those Trump has already imposed on the UK and EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is working to co-ordinate the European response to the tariff threats, said he would request that the EU activate its \"anti-coercion instrument\" if Trump does impose them. The US president is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday on the theme \"how can we co-operate in a more contested world?\" Macron, as well as the leaders of Germany and the EU, will also be attending the annual conference. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who will also be there, said his country was \"concerned by the recent escalation\" and that it would be \"significantly increasing Arctic security — strengthening our military and investing in critical infrastructure\". \"Canada strongly believes that the best way to secure the Arctic is by working together within Nato,\" he also wrote on X. The head of Nato, Mark Rutte, meanwhile, said he had spoken to Trump \"regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic\". \"We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week,\" he added.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock Protests were held over the weekend in both Denmark and Greenland", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 18:44:52 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-18T18:57:30.360370"}

Netanyahu's office said it was \"not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\", following Saturday's announcement of the committee's Gaza Executive Board, which includes the Turkish foreign minister and a Qatari official, as well as former-UK PM Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Board of Peace, which is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war, is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction. Its exact structure remains unclear and members are still being invited.\n\nTwo separate senior bodies have been officially unveiled, both of which sit under the main Board of Peace. One is a \"founding Executive Board\", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).\n\nSo far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: \"The Gaza Strip does not need any \"administrative committee\" to oversee its \"rehabilitation\" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists\". Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a \"diplomatic failure for Israel.\" Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.\n\nThe overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said. While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited. Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role. The White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\". The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC. On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute billion dollars ($1bn; £745m) to join the panel. Speaking to CBS news , a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, António Guterres said Washington's \"clear conviction\" was that multilateral solutions were irrelevant. What mattered, he continued, was the \"exercise of the power and influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\". His comments come weeks after the US struck Venezuela and seized its president - and in the context of Donald Trump's repeated threats to annex Greenland. Guterres said he believed the founding principles of the UN - including the equality of member states - were now under threat. President Trump has previously been scathing in his criticism of the United Nations. He used his address at last September's General Assembly to question its very purpose, claiming he had \"ended seven unendable wars\" on his own and the UN \"did not even try to help in any of them\". \"Later I realised that the UN wasn't there for us,\" he said.\n\nPresented with this damning assessment, Guterres admitted his organisation was struggling to make members abide by the international laws laid out in the UN Charter. The UN was \"extremely engaged\" in solving major global conflicts, he insisted. \"But the UN has no leverage - the big powers have stronger leverage. He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. \"There is a big difference between the two things,\" he noted. Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle \"dramatic problems and challenges\" facing its 193 members. \"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power,\" the UN chief said. \"Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\". He suggested the UN Security Council - designed to maintain international peace and security - no longer represented the world and was \"ineffective\". Any one of the council's permanent members - France, China, Russia, the UK or US - can currently veto resolutions. Both Russia and the US have used this power to frustrate global efforts to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Guterres claimed vetoes were being used to further individual members' interests, and criticised the fact that \"three European countries\" were permanent members. He called for changes to the council's composition - to \"regain legitimacy\" and \"give voice to the whole world\" - and to limit veto powers to avoid unacceptable \"blockages\".\n\nReuters Guterres, whose term as secretary general is coming to an end, met Sir Keir Starmer in London last Friday\n\nGuterres – a former Portuguese prime minister – took on the job of heading the UN in 2017, and will leave the role at the end of this year. In his annual remarks to the General Assembly, traditionally used to identify the organisation's priorities, he warned of a world in chaos, \"brimming with conflict, impunity, inequality and unpredictability\", and identified \"brazen violations of international law\" as one of the biggest challenges facing the global order. One of the ongoing conflicts Guterres identified as key for the UN was Gaza. For large parts of the war it was prevented from distributing aid in the strip, as Israel blocked international humanitarian organisations from bringing it into the territory. At one point, Israel even backed an external contractor – the Gaza Humanitarian Organisation – to do the work the UN had traditionally carried out for decades. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed trying to access food at GHF sites. When asked if he saw the UN as powerless in Gaza where it should have made a difference, he said: \"Of course, but let's be clear. \"For a long time, Israel was saying that humanitarian aid was not distributed because the UN was not able to do so. Of course, whenever Israel would not allow us to move into Gaza, we couldn't move into Gaza. And then there was a ceasefire, and a massive flow of humanitarian aid.\" He stressed: \"We were ready, provided we had the conditions.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 06:17:06 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-19T06:49:01.416522"}

It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south from Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added.\n\nWhat caused the crash?\n\nWhat caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".\n\nAre people still trapped in the trains?\n\nThere were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Alvia, according to a statement from state-owned rail operator Renfe. It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE. \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive.

Its comments came in its latest world economic outlook, where it described the global economy as \"steady\", with growth expected to remain \"resilient\" this year. The IMF's forecast was produced ahead of Donald Trump's threat at the weekend to impose tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. The fund also said the independence of central banks was \"paramount\" for global economic stability and growth.\n\nThe economic watchdog said global growth was projected to reach 3.3% this year - an increase from its previous forecast of 3.1% - before slowing slightly to 3.2% in 2027. Speaking to the BBC, IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said: \"We have a picture of a global economy that is growing at - it's not outsized growth rates but it's quite resilient, quite robust. \"In a sense the global economy has been shaking off the trade disruptions of 2025, and it's coming out ahead of what we were expecting.\" He said while the effects of Trumps' tariffs has been \"definitely to slow down global activity\", he added that there \"have been other things that have been more than offsetting\". The IMF's report says the global economy has been helped by \"tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)\". However, it said risks to the global outlook \"remain tilted to the downside\", warning that if expectations about AI growth turn out to be overly optimistic an abrupt market correction could be triggered. Even a relatively mild market correction could have an impact, Gourinchas said, given how much share price gains have contributed to wealth gains in recent years. Other risks are emerging as firms increasingly take on debt to make AI investments. \"It doesn't take as much of a market reaction to have an impact on people's wealth relative to their income so that they start cutting consumption, [businesses start] changing their investment plans etc, so there could be some vulnerability there,\" he said. As well as an end to the AI boom, another possible risk highlighted by the IMF was that \"trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity\". \"Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices.\"\n\nThe IMF estimates the UK grew by 1.4% in 2025, slightly up from its previous projection of 1.3%. Its forecast for this year remains unchanged at 1.3%, which would make it the third fastest growing economy in the G7 behind the US and Canada. It predicts 1.5% growth in 2027. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF had upgraded the UK's growth for the third time since April 2025, and the country was \"on course to be the fastest growing European G7 economy this year and next\". But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"A 0.1% uptick is not a triumph and the fact Rachel Reeves is celebrating it shows how desperate she has become.\" The IMF expects global inflation to fall from an estimated 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and further to 3.4% the following year. In the UK, Gourinchas said price changes in regulated industries, such as transport and energy, had kept inflation elevated last year but \"that's going to fade away\". The IMF expects UK inflation to return to the 2% target by the end of the year, as a weakening labour market continues to keep wage growth down.\n\nEPA US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell revealed last week he was the subject of a criminal investigation", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:04:56 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-19T11:47:23.491990"}

In a message to Norway's prime minister, Trump blamed the country for not giving him the prize. \"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper' for the US\", Trump said in the message obtained by US media. \"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,\" he added.\n\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, confirmed the message and its contents. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said he had received the text message on Sunday in response to a text he and Finland's president Alexander Stubb had sent to Trump. Støre said they had conveyed opposition to proposed tariff increases over the Greenland dispute, and pointed to the need to de-escalate, proposing a three-way phone call the same day. Støre noted an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump has made no secret of his desire to be awarded the annual prize. He has increasingly insisted that the US needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The sparsely-populated but resource-rich Arctic island is well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. Trump has repeated that he wants the US to buy Greenland and has not ruled out using military force against a member of the Nato security alliance to take it. Over the weekend, he said he would impose a 10% tariff on goods from eight Nato allies starting in February if they oppose his proposed takeover, and threatened to raise it to 25% by June. In his message to Støre, Trump said Denmark cannot protect Greenland from Russia or China, and questioned \"why do they have a \"right of ownership\" anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also\". \"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,\" he concluded.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday that any decision about the future status of Greenland \"belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone\", and called the use of tariffs against allies \"wrong\". Danish defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen and Greenlandic foreign affairs minister Vivian Motzfeldt are due to meet on Monday with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.

That is why, according to America's president, US control of Greenland is essential. So how do you think Moscow has reacted to its alleged plot being uncovered and potentially thwarted by a US takeover of Greenland? The Russians can't be pleased. Right? Wrong.\n\nIn an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland. \"Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta. \"Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.\" \"Greatest deal\"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America.\n\n\"If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta. \"With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars. \"If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement.\" And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn. \"It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend.\"\n\nIn other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper. Let that sink in. But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement? It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation. Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato. Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia. \"Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this,\" gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:26:34 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-19T16:44:10.117494"}

More than 120 more people were injured as carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening. The crash is the worst the country has seen in more than a decade.\n\nRail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.

European allies have rallied around Greenland's sovereignty. Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for \"Greenlanders and for the Danes alone\" to decide. On Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries.\n\nAsked by NBC News if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump answered: \"No comment\". The US president said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark. Trump said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949. Asked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Mr Trump told NBC News: \"I will, 100%.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump added: \"Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland.\" Denmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic. However, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies.\n\nDanish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were \"not the way forward\". \"We have red lines that can't be crossed,\" he told Sky News. \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation.\" Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said the alliance will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on the security of the Arctic. The European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland.

But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\" All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.\n\nEurope's good cop, bad cop approach\n\nIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president. Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach. European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland. At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images European leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland\n\nThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too. European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans. The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024. So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs). \"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.\n\nWPA Pool/Getty Images Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\n\n\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank. \"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy. \"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"\n\nTrust in US security guarantees\n\nBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed. Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\" European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't. Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further. And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.\n\nGetty Images The Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this month\n\nWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence. \"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\" But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.\n\nShutterstock It's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has said\n\nOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\". As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed. \"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund. \"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said. But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"\n\nPutin and the Board of Peace\n\nWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling. The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil. China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way. Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.\n\nAFP via Getty The Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of Peace\n\nThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order. Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference. The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.\n\nAFP via Getty Images France does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a source\n\nThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace. \"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads. The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan. Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.\n\nBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it? \"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy. \"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"\n\nRelations are strained but not broken\n\nPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant. The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures. Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter. It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending. Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.\n\nGetty Images Asked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many Greenlanders\n\nTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open. Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together. Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here. But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters. All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.\n\nTop picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/Lightrocket", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:04:54 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-20T04:52:58.592365"}

Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players. But Israel insists it's been built without the necessary permits. In this deeply divided land so much is contested; from the identities and faiths of the people who live here, to every inch of the ground they stand on. Recently, that has come to include one small patch of artificial turf laid down under the shadow of the giant concrete wall that isolates Israel from much of the occupied West Bank.\n\nIn the context of the 7 October attacks, the two-year war in Gaza and the fragility of the current ceasefire, there are without doubt far more pressing issues. But this is a story freighted with symbolism and one which has drawn outsized international attention because of its connection to that other world religion - football. On the day we visit, a group of Palestinian children are lining up to take penalty shots in the winter sunshine. The construction of the pitch began here on the edge of Bethlehem in 2020, and today it provides a place to practise for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp. The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal. The notice was followed soon by a demolition order. \"We don't have anywhere else to play,\" 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back. \"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"\n\nI asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction. \"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\" The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support. The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve. But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice. As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill. The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state. Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank. But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones. The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The West Bank was split into three categories of territory. Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control. In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control. Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control. The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued.\n\nWhile that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today. Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A. But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge. Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis. Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land. But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall. For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs. But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side. Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall. The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control.\n\nBBC News The children's football club in Bethlehem sits next to the wall separating the occupied West Bank from Israel", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:23:51 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-20T10:00:55.376648"}

Rescuers worked through a second night as more bodies are feared to be trapped in the wreckage. More than 120 people were injured when carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, hitting an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening. A faulty or damaged weld on a rail is being investigated as a factor in the crash, Spanish media report. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has cancelled his planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, pledging to get to the bottom of Spain's worst train disaster in more than a decade.\n\nSpain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia will visit the site later on Tuesday. Three days of national mourning have been announced.\n\nTransport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\". Officials are working to identify the dead. Puente said the investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as \"extremely strange\". Spanish media report that a 30cm gap in one of the rails is the current focus of the investigation. Technicians told the El Mundo newspaper that a \"bad\" or \"deteriorated\" weld was \"more than likely\" the cause for the derailment.\n\nIgnacio Barron, head of Spain's Commission of Investigation of Rail Accidents (CIAF), said on RTVE: \"What always plays a part in a derailment is the interaction between the track and the vehicle, and that is what the commission is currently [looking into].\" However, Spain's El País newspaper reports that it was not clear whether the fault was a cause or a result of the crash. On Monday, Renfe President Álvaro Fernández Heredia apparently ruled out \"human error\", telling RNE programme Las Mañanas that, if \"the driver makes a mistake, the system itself corrects it\". Heredia also told RNE that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. As the investigation into the crash continues, Spanish media reported that train drivers warned about the state of the Madrid-Andalusia line in August and requested a speed limit of under 250kph. In a letter to the state-owned rail infrastructure administrator, Adif, the drivers union reportedly said the increase in the number and weight of high-speed trains was causing a greater number of failures.\n\nFour hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care. Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, officials said.\n\nSalvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said. Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.

Drones, ballistic and cruise missiles targeted several locations in Ukraine, including Kyiv, Dnipro in the centre and Odesa in the south. Air raid alerts in the capital lasted for most of the night. On Tuesday, sirens rang out again as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital. President Volodymyr Zelensky said a \"significant number\" of targets had been intercepted. But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m).\n\nBetween Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine. On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water. Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following the large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight. \"I have no electricity and no water,\" Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. \"I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night.\" The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv. He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added.\n\nTemperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor. As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities. \"I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse,\" says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten \"so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them.\" But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, \"the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid.\" In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures.

In a post on social media, Trump labelled the move as an \"act of great stupidity\" and \"total weakness\", months after he and senior US officials endorsed it. In response, the UK government said it would \"never compromise on our national security\", while the prime minister's official spokesperson insisted the US still supported the move. The UK signed the £3.4bn ($4.6bn) agreement in May, under which it would retain control of a UK-US military base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday morning, Trump said: \"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. \"There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness.\" He added: \"The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\" Responding, the prime minister's official spokesman said that the US supports the deal and \"the president explicitly recognised its strength last year\". He added that it was also backed by the UK's Five Eyes allies, the other members of which - besides the UK and US - are Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Asked if he could categorically say the Chagos deal would go ahead, even though it is still going through Parliament, the spokesman said: \"Yes. Categorically, our position hasn't changed.\" Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said it had acted \"because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future\". They added that the agreement had secured the operations of the joint US-UK military base \"for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out\", and noted the deal had been welcomed by allies including the US. UK Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty later said the government \"will of course have discussions with the [Trump] administration in the coming days to remind them of the strength of this deal and how it secures the base\". Mauritius' attorney general Gavin Glover has said he still expects the agreement to go ahead. In a statement he said it was \"important to remember\" that the deal was \"negotiated, concluded and signed exclusively between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Mauritius\". He added: \"The sovereignty of the Republic of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago is already unambiguously recognised by international law and should no longer be subject to debate.\"\n\nThe agreement followed a long-running dispute between the UK and Mauritius - a former British colony - about sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony. Britain purchased the islands for £3m, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence. Under the deal agreed in May last year, the UK would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of the military base on Diego Garcia.

The suspension is set to be announced in Strasbourg, France on Wednesday. The move would mark another escalation in tensions between the US and Europe, as Donald Trump ratchets up his efforts to acquire Greenland, threatening new tariffs over the issue on the weekend. The stand-off has rattled financial markets, reviving talk of a trade war and the possibility of retaliation against the US for its trade measures.\n\nShares on both sides of the Atlantic were lower on Tuesday, with European stock markets seeing a second day of losses and the three main US stock indices down by more than 1% in morning trading. On the currency markets, the US dollar also fell sharply. The euro climbed 0.8% against dollar to $1.1742 while the pound rose by 0.2% to $1.346. Borrowing costs also rippled higher around the world, as the biggest sell-off of long-term government debt in months drove up yields on 30-year bonds in markets including the US, UK and Germany.\n\nTrade tensions between the US and Europe had eased since the two sides struck a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July. That agreement set US levies on European goods at 15%, down from the 30% Trump had initially threatened as part of his \"Liberation Day\" wave of tariffs in April. In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes at on the continent expected to boost US exports. The deal still needs approval from the European Parliament to become official. But on Saturday, within hours of Trump's threat of US tariffs over Greenland, Manfred Weber, an influential German member of European Parliament, said \"approval is not possible at this stage\". The EU had put on hold plans to retaliate against the US tariffs with its own package targeting €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods while the two sides finalised the details. But that reprieve ends on 6 February, meaning EU levies will come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves for an extension or approves the new deal.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated his warning to European leaders against retaliation, urging them to \"have an open mind\". \"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate. The president will be here tomorrow, and he will get his message across,\" he said. The US has previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:50:55 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-20T17:55:40.538376"}

Checker previously spent more than a decade with the CIA as a conflict analyst; previous appointees to the role have generally been career diplomats.\n\nChecker’s appointment comes after the Trump administration released a new US national security strategy in November. That strategy outlines the administration’s foreign policy priorities: promoting far-right interests in Europe, and taking a more transactional view towards much of the rest of the world. It says the US should “transition from an aid-focused relationship with Africa to a trade- and investment-focused relationship.”\n\nThe US should favour partnerships with “capable, reliable partners committed to opening their markets to US goods and services,” it says.\n\nChecker’s email elaborates further on what this strategy means, saying that in Africa “the stakes are often limited, indirect and largely negative (risk management)”.\n\n“To put it bluntly, Africa is a peripheral – rather than a core – theater for US interests that demands strategic economy,” it says. “Framing Africa as ‘strategic’ has often historically served bureaucratic and moral imperatives, not hard interests.”\n\nIt identifies several “opportunities for engagement” for the US, among them “negotiating settlements to ongoing conflicts (eg, DRC-Rwanda, Sudan),” and says that promising areas for investment are critical mineral development and the energy sector.\n\nA former senior state foreign service official with two decades of experience in Africa who had seen the email called it “offensive and downright racist”, and said its suggestions were against US national security interests.\n\nChecker is “wildly out of touch with reality”, said Kristofer Harrison, a former senior official at the US state department and president of the Dekleptocracy Project, an anti-corruption NGO.\n\n“He’s talking about communities where the US withdrew lifesaving drugs that kept people alive. Yet, he’s concerned about messaging to those surviving that America is generous?”\n\nA diplomat from west Africa, who has worked in mediating conflicts across Chad, the DRC and beyond, said: “US humanitarian aid in the medical and food sectors has greatly alleviated the suffering of many African populations.\n\n“If aid continues, the US can provide information on its volume and usefulness to inform American and international public opinion. However, the fact that aid has been abruptly reduced or stopped is indeed creating unease. It is therefore no longer appropriate to reiterate that the US has demonstrated generosity.”\n\nSeparately, last week the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was gutted last year by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”, circulated an invitation for private companies to bid on a contract to close down the agency. That invitation, also obtained by the Guardian, is for “Institutional Support for USAID Closeout”.\n\n“USAID is undertaking an agency-wide closeout effort requiring the orderly completion of statutory, regulatory, financial, and personnel obligations,” it says.\n\nThe invitation offers an unspecified amount to shut down USAID and suggests the contract will extend, at a maximum, until March 2028. It bars potential bidders from hiring anyone who has previous experience working with USAID.\n\nThe closure of USAID has widely been argued to be against the law, as the agency was created through an act of Congress and dismantled without congressional approval. However, a funding bill that passed the US House last week attempts to codify the final shutdown of the agency.\n\n“It’s absolutely illegal,” said the former state department official. “And it’s illegal to target former USAID staff who served this country.”\n\nWhile the bill has yet to pass the Senate, the invitation for bids suggests the state department is nonetheless moving into a final phase of shutting down the agency.\n\nHarrison said closing USAID was “a gift to worldwide corruption and authoritarianism” and an unwise move on the part of the administration.\n\nThe US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:11:09 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-20T17:55:40.752042"}

And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems. The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as \"extremely strange\". Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz. The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed. After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe. A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.\n\nWatch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade\n\nSeveral officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause. Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".\n\nEPA Grieving Spaniards want answers about what caused the deadly crash\n\nHowever, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision. Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:00:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-20T18:51:47.478870"}

Did the world fail to take enough notice?\n\nTucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals. At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. \"We're taking it back,\" Trump announced. Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. \"We have to have it,\" is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.\n\nUS history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will. No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two. There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity. Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing. \"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock French President Emmanuel Macron spoke at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday but avoided any direct mention of Trump\n\nThere is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force. Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order. When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\" Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.\n\nHow do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way? Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief. \"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue. It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again. \"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.\n\nHe doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents. Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office. But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right. \"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine. \"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"\n\nAnd he doesn't hide it. \"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\" If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases. \"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it. And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about. His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.\n\nReuters Merchandise opposing a US takeover of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, have appeared in shops in Copenhagen\n\nIn the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception. Trump took aim at the American \"interventionists\" whom he excoriated for having \"wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\" In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: \"I think it's been excellent.\" \"Sane-washing\" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side. \"Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent,\" Luce wrote in his latest column.\n\nReuters Trump met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh in May 2025\n\nIt was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that \"at long last we have peace in the Middle East\" for the first time in \"3,000 years.\" The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud. Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the \"Donroe Doctrine.\" President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests.\n\nReuters In October, Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House\n\nSometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again. And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\" \"It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament,\" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic. European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice. Macron has vowed to launch the EU's \"trade bazooka\" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a \"problem of understanding and miscommunication.\" UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs.\n\nReuters Sir Keir Starmer has maintained a largely cordial relationship with Trump since he started his second term as president\n\nThe gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side. \"Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US,\" suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland\". \"Can't wait to see you\", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump \"daddy\" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year.\n\nNato boss commends 'daddy' Trump's handling of Israel-Iran conflict\n\nRutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats. On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own. \"We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be,\" was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week. It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world.\n\nWatch: Canada-China trade relationship \"more predictable\" than with US, says Carney", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:18:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-20T20:56:19.658209"}

His brother, Naveed Memon, was inside Gul Plaza when a massive fire ripped through the densely-packed shopping centre in Pakistan's commercial capital, Karachi. Like dozens of others, he still hasn't been found. \"What should I tell my mother when I go home? What should I tell my nieces?\" asks Amin. \"My nieces are crying for their father - they are asking me why he is late to come home. What should I tell them? How can I tell them that their father is gone?\" Housing an estimated 1,200 shops across a basement, mezzanine and three floors, Gul Plaza was a wholesale market that offered a wide range of cheaply-priced products, including wedding wear, toys, decorations, bed sheets, artificial flowers and baby clothes. The city's residents would frequent it in droves, particularly ahead of festivals, weddings and other important occasions. What started the fire is still unknown. But witnesses say the speed at which it spread, a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster.\n\nMuhammed Amin's brother is still missing\n\nRehan Faisal, who owned a bedsheet shop, said that he was able to escape because his shop was located near one of the exits - he broke down the door to get out. He said that although his staff had heard there was a fire in one part of the market, they had initially not worried because it was located some distance away from them. \"No-one knew it would spread so much,\" Faisal added, saying it only took about \"five to seven minutes\" for everything to \"burn before our eyes\". Shoiab, 19, who worked at a decorations shop, said he first heard about the fire on a lower floor at around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday night. \"Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out,\" he told BBC Urdu. \"Then suddenly everything was covered with smoke - we couldn't see anything and there was panic and confusion everywhere. People were just running here and there. I knew some ways to get out of the plaza. But the first exit I tried was locked and the crowds were too dense for me to go the other way.\" With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked. Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked. Shoiab was among the luckier ones. He fainted amid the smoke, but someone - he doesn't know who - pulled him out of the building to safety. Another colleague who was trying to escape with him is still missing.\n\nEPA The remaining structure is at risk of collapse, making further rescue efforts difficult, an official told the BBC\n\nThe confirmed death toll from the fire currently stands at 27, but more than 70 are still missing and the unstable structure of the still smouldering building is making it difficult for rescue officials to go inside and assess the full extent of the disaster. Dr Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, a senior rescue official, told BBC Urdu that rescue efforts were being slowed further because the structure of the building had been so severely damaged that it was at risk of completely collapsing at any time. He added that many bodies were unrecognisable and they would need to conduct forensic examinations to confirm the exact number of deaths. Meanwhile crowds of people looking for their loved ones have gathered around the building, desperate for any news. Muhammad Qaiser told the BBC that his wife, sister and daughter-in-law were among the missing. \"They had said that they were going to the market. The last contact with them was at 20:00 when it was discovered that a fire had broken out. We do not know what happened to them.\" Qaiser said that officials were unable to help them, describing how his family had been told to visit both the burns centre and the morgue at different times. Another resident, Haroon, said that three of his brothers had been inside the building. Two managed to escape but one was still missing. \"My brother called our parents from inside the plaza asking them to save him. He also called his friends and appealed to them, but no one could save him,\" he said.\n\nReuters Some are questioning if more could have been done to save those trapped inside\n\nThe survivor, Shoaib, is also still at the building hoping for news of his cousin, Faizan, who worked at a different shop. \"Every morning, I used to go to work and back with my cousin. Now I don't feel like going back home without him. I'm waiting for him to be pulled out of the building alive,\" he said, adding that his phone was ringing all the time because Faizan's family keep asking if he had any news. \"I have no answers for them.\" As the searches continue, anger is growing. On Monday, hundreds of protesters gathered around the building calling for accountability. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who arrived on the scene nearly 24 hours after the fire broke out, was met with jeers. Muhammed Arif, whose nephew is among the missing, says that the relief work did not start on time and that \"precious lives could have been saved\". Many residents and politicians have echoed the sentiment that rescue officials took long to get to the building. Faisal said that it took a long time for the fire brigade to arrive, \"while the ambulances, which weren't even needed at that moment - had already reached\".", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:03:08 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T04:50:45.590849"}

Abe's assassination stunned the country where there is virtually no gun crime.\n\nTetsuya Yamagami himself pleaded guilty to the crime at the trial's opening last year, but what punishment he deserves has divided public opinion in Japan. While many see the 45-year-old as a cold-blooded murderer, some sympathise with his troubled upbringing.\n\nThe man who killed Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe has been sentenced to life in prison, three and a half years after he fatally shot the ex-leader during a rally in the western city of Nara.\n\nHis mother's devotion to the Unification Church bankrupted the family, and Yamagami bore a grudge against Abe after realising the ex-leader's ties to the controversial church.\n\nNearly 700 people lined up outside the Nara district court on Wednesday to attend the sentencing hearing.\n\nAbe's shocking death while giving a speech in broad daylight prompted investigations into the Unification Church and its questionable practices, including soliciting financially ruinous donations from its followers.\n\nThe case also exposed links with politicians from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and resulted in the resignations of several cabinet ministers.\n\nJournalist Eito Suzuki, who covered all but one of Yamagami's court hearings, said Yamagami and his family seemed \"overwhelmed with despair\" throughout the trial.\n\nYamagami \"exuded a sense of world-weariness and resignation\", recounts Suzuki, who began looking into the Unification Church long before Abe's shocking murder.\n\n\"Everything is true. There is no doubt that I did this,\" Yamagami said solemnly on the first day of his trial in October 2025. Armed with a homemade gun assembled using two metal pipes and duct tape, he fired two shots at Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022.\n\nThe murder of Japan's most recognisable public figure at the time – Abe remains the longest-serving PM in Japanese history – sent shockwaves around the world.\n\nCalling for a jail term of no more than 20 years, Yamagami's lawyers argued that he was a victim of \"religious abuse\". He resented the church because his mother donated to it his late father's life insurance and other assets, amounting to 100 million yen (S$828,750), the court heard.\n\nYamagami spoke of his grievance against Abe after seeing his video message at a church-related event in 2021, but said he had initially planned to attack church executives, not Abe.\n\nSuzuki recalls Abe's widow Akie's look of disbelief when Yamagami said the ex-leader was not his main target. Her expression \"remains vividly etched in my mind\", Suzuki says.\n\n\"It conveyed a sense of shock, like she was asking: Was my husband merely a tool used to settle a grudge against the religious organisation? Is that all it was?\"\n\nIn an emotional statement read to the court, Akie Abe said the sorrow of losing her husband \"will never be relieved\".\n\n\"I just wanted him to stay alive,\" she had said.\n\nFounded in South Korea, the Unification Church entered Japan in the 1960s and cultivated ties with politicians to grow its following, researchers say.\n\nWhile not a member, Abe, like several other Japanese politicians, would occasionally appear at church-related events. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance.\n\nIn March last year, a Tokyo court revoked the church's status as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being.\n\nThe church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples.\n\nYamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the \"dire circumstances she and her siblings endured\" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls.\n\n\"It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying,\" he says.\n\nBut prosecutors argue there is \"a leap in logic\" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence.\n\nObservers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions.\n\n\"It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family,\" Suzuki says.\n\nBut he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how \"victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes\".\n\n\"This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime,\" Suzuki says.\n\nRin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in \"widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church\".\n\n\"Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions],\" Ushiyama says.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:48:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T04:50:45.734510"}

His bombshell statement threatens to derail both their public reputation and their private life. \"We've tried to give our children the most normal upbringing as possible,\" David said in his 2023 Netflix documentary, as Brooklyn was shown checking up on his cooking. \"But you've got a dad that was England captain and a mum that was Posh Spice.\" David went on to say how proud he was, and \"so in awe of my children and the way they've turned out\" - making the point that his family had withstood the pressures of fame. In hindsight, the clip feels more like a warning about how difficult that is. And while David's sentiments were surely genuine, viewers might also question how much has been said and done for the benefit of the cameras.\n\n'The non-royal royal family'\n\nThat documentary, and the subsequent series about Victoria, were both made by the Beckhams' own production company, meaning they were ultimately in control of what story was being told. That's part of a strategy that has seen them remain famously protective of their public image as they have grown their global fame and an empire worth an estimated £500m. As well as being perhaps the ultimate celebrity power couple, Victoria has built a career as a fashion designer, and David has business interests ranging from clothing to health supplements. The brand got perhaps the ultimate accolade when David was knighted by the King last year. \"They are the non-royal royal family of our celebrity culture, and people have been invested in them and their dynastic branding for the last 25 years or more,\" says entertainment journalist Caroline Frost.\n\nEPA The Beckham clan, including Brooklyn and Nicola (right), turned out for the premiere of David's Netflix documentary in 2023\n\nBut their documentaries, social feeds and interviews reveal a carefully curated version of their family life. And they stay firmly on message whenever the Beckhams are riding out any scandals and storms, of which there have been a few - from his alleged affairs, to embarrassing leaked emails about not being knighted sooner, to controversy about his role as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The biggest threat to the Beckhams' family brand could now come from their eldest child, whose explosive post \"has ruptured it from within\", Frost told BBC Radio 5 Live. After months of rumours about a rift, 26-year-old Brooklyn Peltz Beckham claimed his family \"values public promotion and endorsements above all else\", and that brand protection went too far. \"Brand Beckham comes first,\" he wrote. \"Family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it's at the expense of our professional obligations.\" He also posted: \"For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.\" David and Victoria haven't directly responded to Brooklyn's public grievances.\n\nThe Beckhams have been \"incredibly talented at controlling their own narrative publicly\", and the brand has strong foundations, according to celebrity crisis PR Lauren Beeching. \"The Beckham name operates as commercial architecture, not just a surname at this point, and I would say that architecture is extremely strong. \"The Beckhams have decades of goodwill, global recognition and a fan base that spans generations, and also their recent Netflix documentaries were massive global hits and reinforced that stable, emotionally controlled, likeable image of a family.\" However, the rift with Brooklyn will cause pain both personally and professionally, Beeching believes. \"The Beckhams are very protective of their brand, so this will be incredibly stressful for them because it goes against everything they're trying to stand for, which is basically a united family front.\"\n\n'A family for a brand'\n\nOver the past 30 years, the Beckhams have navigated a media landscape that has morphed from a tabloid feeding frenzy into a social media free-for-all, so the instinct to protect their image is perhaps understandable. But some believe they are reaping the consequences of putting their family in the limelight to benefit the brand. The Guardian's Marina Hyde said Brooklyn had been \"commodified\" since before he was born, with his parents selling pictures and stories from as early as Victoria's pregnancy. But, Hyde added, his parents refined their media strategy as he grew older. \"As time went on, David and Victoria acquired more sophisticated advisers who understood the rapidly morphing potential of controlling image and brand, and built a vast and diversified empire for them off the back of it.\" Others, however, suggest Brooklyn is spoiled, has taken advantage of the family name himself, and shouldn't post on social media about his desire for privacy. Tom Bower, author of 2024 biography The House of Beckham, sympathises with Brooklyn and isn't persuaded by the image his parents project. \"The Beckhams are a phoney family,\" he told 5 Live. \"It's a family for a brand, and it's been very successful... \"And the truth is, they're not a happy family. They are a commercial product, which has earned them a fortune, but the victims have been their children.\" However, journalist Hadley Freeman, ghostwriter of Victoria Beckham's 2006 biography, says in her experience they were \"both incredibly sweet, incredibly involved with their children, very loving as a family\". \"At the same time, there is this problem with some famous people, which is that they are addicted to their fame, and they are addicted to how people see them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"It's not hard to imagine what it's like to be a relative within that situation and to feel maybe a little exploited at times, and to see the disparity between what is put on social media and the reality.\"\n\nGetty Images Brooklyn has launched his own brand of hot sauce, while his wife Nicola is an actress and director", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:05:28 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T07:58:13.396421"}
{"title": "Could US Congress stop Trump from taking over Greenland?", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c701rvrpjwko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "summary": "Some of the president's fellow Republicans oppose him - but it's not clear if they would join Democrats to block a takeover of the island.", "content": "Could US Congress stop Trump from taking over Greenland?\n\n59 minutes ago Share Save Daniel Bush Washington correspondent Share Save\n\nWatch: BBC on the mood in Davos ahead of Trump's arrival to the economic forum\n\nPresident Donald Trump's push to acquire Greenland has sparked a backlash from Republicans in Congress, as lawmakers voice growing concern about US military interventions overseas. But it remains unclear if enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats to block a takeover of the island territory - and whether Trump would bow to pressure from Congress, or act alone as he's done several times in a second term marked by growing American entanglements abroad. The focus on Greenland has grown into a broader discussion over the Trump administration's unilateral use of military force, along with diplomatic and economic coercion, to project power in Venezuela, Iran and elsewhere around the world. Republicans have largely backed Trump's foreign policy agenda since he returned to the White House. But now, a growing number are siding with Democrats in Congress and Nato allies who say a takeover of Greenland would violate US and international law.\n\nIn recent days, some Republican leaders have said there's little interest in the US buying Greenland or seizing it through military force. Some Republican lawmakers have also joined Democrats in opposing a new plan by Trump to place tariffs on countries that don't back his bid to acquire the territory, which is self-governed but controlled by Denmark. The proposed tariffs would be \"bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America's allies,\" Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina wrote on social media, adding that the move would benefit China and Russia. \"It's great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided.\" Other Republicans said Trump's ambition to annex Greenland was threatening to undermine the Nato alliance - to which both the US and Denmark belong - in a moment of growing tension between the US and European allies. \"Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski, the co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, said in a statement. Trump has argued the US must own the territory to better compete with China and Russia in the Arctic, and has vowed to take it \"one way or another\". On Tuesday, the US president downplayed concerns that the issue was hurting Nato when asked by the BBC if he was willing to see the decades-old security alliance collapse as a consequence of his push for the territory. Trump reiterated his view that ownership of Greenland was critical for US and global security. \"We need [Greenland] for national security and even world security,\" he said.\n\nWatch: BBC asks if breakup of Nato is price Trump willing to pay for Greenland\n\nBut Trump's insistence on obtaining the territory is increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill. Congress has some options to try to reign Trump in, if Republicans and Democrats do choose to pick a fight with the president over Greenland. Congress has the power of the purse and in theory would have to approve funding used to buy Greenland, experts said. Denmark and Greenland have both insisted the island isn't for sale. \"If Trump wants to buy Greenland it would require an act of Congress to provide the funds to do so,\" said Daniel Schuman, the executive director of the American Governance Institute and an expert on congressional procedure. It's unlikely that Congress could repurpose existing funding to buy the territory, Schuman added. Still, the administration has expanded the use of executive power to enact Trump's immigration and tariff agenda, among other issues. The administration might try to claim some new authority to seize Greenland that would allow it to overrule any roadblocks by Congress, Schuman said. Lawmakers worried about a military incursion in Greenland have signalled support for measures prohibiting any US action without congressional approval. But it's unclear if the proposals have enough Republican support to pass in either chamber of Congress. Five Senate Republicans joined Democrats earlier this month to advance a bill that would have blocked the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela, following the attack in December that deposed former President Nicolás Maduro. The Venezuela war powers resolution ultimately failed to get through the Senate. But it signalled mounting frustration from Republican and Democratic lawmakers with Trump's use of military force abroad, after he ran in 2024 on a promise to reduce US involvement in foreign conflicts. Last week a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Denmark in a symbolic show of support for Greenland. It's also unclear how the Senate, which ratifies treaties, would respond if the US reached some sort of agreement with Denmark to take over part or all of Greenland. The US has an existing arrangement with Denmark established in 1951 that allows the US to expand its military presence in Greenland. Murkowski and other Republicans have argued that the US doesn't need to take over the territory to address national security needs in the region. The Senate could try to thwart Trump by opposing a treaty between the US and Denmark, in the event the two nations reach an agreement. Treaties require two-thirds support in the Senate for ratification, which Republicans currently fall well short of.\n\nGetty Images Last week, a US bipartisan delegation which included Senator Lisa Murkowski (C) visited Denmark in a show of solidarity with the US ally\n\nSome Republicans have already indicated that they'd consider breaking with Trump over Greenland. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the former majority leader in the upper chamber of Congress, told reporters that a US takeover of the territory would \"shatter the trust of allies\". Faced with growing Republican concern over Greenland, Trump could look to strike a deal that falls short of a formal treaty and doesn't require Senate approval. But it's unclear if presidents have the authority to make such agreements without input from Congress, analysts said. \"Plenty of international agreements are concluded in forms other than treaties,\" said Josh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown Law, but \"I'm sceptical that something of this magnitude could be concluded as a pure executive agreement.\" Trump did not say on Tuesday whether he believed he was constrained by anything in his pursuit of Greenland. Asked how far he was willing to go, Trump told reporters to stay tuned. \"I think something is going to happen that's going to be very good for everybody,\" Trump said.

{"title": "Japan restarts world's largest nuclear plant", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6v0v32rg1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "summary": "Japan restars a reactor at the world's largest nuclear plant nearly 15 years after the Fukushima disaster.", "content": "Japan restarts world's largest nuclear plant\n\n34 minutes ago Share Save Koh Ewe Share Save\n\nGetty Images The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant has the world's largest installed capacity\n\nJapan has restarted a reactor at the world's largest nuclear plant nearly 15 years after a disaster at the Fukushima power plant forced the country to shut all its nuclear reactors. Reactor no.6 at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant located northwest of Tokyo was restarted on Wednesday. It was delayed by one day because of an alarm malfunction and is expected to begin operating commercially next month. This is the latest installment in Japan's nuclear power reboot, which still has a long way to go. The seventh reactor is not expected to come back on until 2030, and the remaining five could be decommissioned. That leaves the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational: 8.2 gigawatts. Japan, which had always heavily relied on energy imports, was an early adopter of nuclear power. But these ambitions were scuppered in 2011 by what is now remembered as one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. Triggered by the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, the meltdown in the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi led to radioactive leakage. It traumatised local communities that were evacuated, and many have not returned despite official assurances that it was safe to do so. Critics say the plant's owner Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, was not prepared, and the response from them and government was not well-coordinated. An independent government report called it a \"man-made disaster\" and blamed Tepco, although a court later cleared three of their exectuives of negligence. Still the fear and lack of trust fuelled public opposition to nuclear power and Japan suspended its entire fleet of 54 reactors shortly after the Fukushima disaster. It has now spent the past decade trying to wake up those power plants. Since 2015, it has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is the first of those owned by Tepco to be turned back on. Before 2011, nuclear power accounted for nearly 30% of Japan's electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030. Its energy plan last year unveiled a tamer goal: it wants nuclear power to provide 20% of its electricity needs by 2040. Even that may be tricky.\n\n'A drop on a hot stone'\n\nGlobal momentum is building around nuclear energy, with the International Atomic Energy Agency estimating that the world's nuclear power capacity could more than double by 2050. In Japan, as of 2023, nuclear power accounted for just 8.5% of electricity. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office in October, has emphasised the importance of nuclear power for Japan's energy self-sufficiency. Especially as it expects energy demand to surge because of data centres and semiconductor manufacturing. But the costs of operating nuclear reactors has surged because of new safety checks that require hefty investments from companies trying to restart their plants. \"Nuclear power is getting much more expensive than they ever thought it would,\" says Koppenborg. The government could subsidise the costs, or pass them on to consumers - both unpalatable options for Japan's leaders, who have for decades been hailing the affordability of nuclear power. An expensive energy bill could also hurt the government at a time when households are protesting about rising costs. The government's \"hands are tied when it comes to financially supporting nuclear power, unless it's willing to go back on one of the main selling points\", Koppenborg says. \"I think [Japan's nuclear power revival] is a drop on a hot stone, because it does not change the larger picture of nuclear power decline in Japan.\"\n\nGetty Images Only one of the seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant are coming back on for now\n\nBeyond the fear of another disaster like Fuksuhima, a series of scandals have also rattled public trust. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in particular found itself embroiled in a couple of them. In 2023, one of its employees lost a stack of documents after placing it on top of their car and forgetting it there before driving away. In November, another was found to have mishandled confidential documents. A TEPCO spokesperson said the company reported the incidents to the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), adding that it aimed to continue improving security management. These revelations are \"a good sign\" for transparency, says Koppenborg. But they also reveal that \"Tepco is struggling to change its ways [and] the way it approaches safety\". Earlier this month, the NRA suspended its review to restart nuclear reactors at Chubu Electric's Hamaoka plant in central Japan, after the company was found to have manipulated quake data in its tests. The company apologised saying: \"We will continue to respond sincerely, and to the fullest extent possible, to the instructions and guidance of the NRA.\" Nei, the former nuclear official, said while he was \"surprised\" by the scandal at Hamaoka, he believed the harsh penalty dealt to its operator should deter other companies from doing the same. \"Power companies should recognise the importance not to [falsify data],\" he said, adding that authorities will \"reject and punish\" offending companies.\n\nSurviving another Fukushima\n\nWhat happened at Fukushima turned Japanese public opinion against what had been hailed as an affordable and sustainable form of energy. In the weeks after the March 2011 disaster, 44% of Japanese thought the use of nuclear power should be reduced, according to a survey by Pew Research Center. That figure jumped to 70% by 2012. Since then, thousands of residents have filed class action lawsuits against Tepco and the Japanese government, demanding compensation for property damage, emotional distress and health problems allegedly linked to radiation exposure. In 2023, the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant sparked anxiety and anger both at home and abroad. Many today remain opposed to restarting nuclear plants. In December, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly where Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is located, voicing safety concerns. \"If something was to happen at the plant, we would be the ones to suffer the consequences,\" one protester told Reuters. Last week, ahead of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa's restart, a small crowd gathered in front of Tepco's headquarters to protest again.\n\nGetty Images Many remain opposed to Japan's nuclear power revival", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:27:48 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T11:02:43.670951"}

The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.

The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.\n\nGetty Images Protesters on a street in Tehran on 9 January\n\nBBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\". Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out. Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify. We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said. Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen.\n\nCrowds of anti-government protesters in Tehran\n\nThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment. Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming. Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession. BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare. We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:56:20 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T13:02:35.549064"}

It said the Aida Youth Centre's pitch was constructed without the necessary permits. It said the demolition was necessary for security reasons. An international campaign to save it, including a petition with more than half a million signatures, appears to have forced the authorities to reconsider. The club, however, said it had not yet received any official notification.\n\nIt is barely a 10th of the size of a full-scale football field, there are patches of rust on the goalposts and, towering over the length of one of the touchlines, the architecture of conflict looms large in Israel's concrete security barrier. But while it may not rank high up among the world's iconic sporting venues, this children's football club has found itself at the centre of a hard-fought international campaign for its survival. And despite the asymmetrical odds as it took on the Israeli state, that campaign appears - for now at least - to have worked. The club has won a reprieve against the threat of demolition by the Israeli military, which claimed that the pitch was far too close to the barrier.\n\nOn the very northern edge of Bethlehem, construction of the pitch began in 2020 with the aim of providing a place to practise football for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp. The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal. The notice was followed by a demolition order, issued at the end of December. \"We don't have anywhere else to play, 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back. \"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\" I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction. \"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\" The community fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures as well as the reported interventions of senior officials from some of football's global and regional governing bodies. In its latest statement, the Israeli military repeated its claim that the football pitch, built so close to the wall, posed a security issue.

It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination. The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain. The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue.\n\nOver the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there. Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science. Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done. Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved. \"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain\". The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old.\n\nIn 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University. \"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\". The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock. One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world. Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say.\n\nAhdi Agus Oktaviana More recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.\n\nAfter the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\". He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method. Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region. Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:00:07 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T17:02:27.766195"}

He may well have forgotten German is the most widely spoken of the four official languages in Switzerland. Many people – from Brussels to Berlin to Paris – will have found his speech to be insulting, overbearing and inaccurate. In it, he presented the idea that Europe is careering down the wrong path. That is a theme Trump has frequently explored, but it has a different impact when delivered on European soil to the faces of supposed friends and allies.\n\nThere is undoubtedly huge relief across Europe that the US president ruled out the use of military force to take Greenland at the forum in Davos. But, even if he keeps his word, the fundamental problem remains that he wants a piece of land the owners say is not for sale. \"What is quite clear after this speech is that the president's ambition remains intact,\" Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told reporters in Copenhagen. He said Trump's comments about the military were \"positive in isolation\". Thousands of miles from Davos in Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital, government officials unveiled a new brochure giving advice to residents about what to do if there were a \"crisis\" in the territory. Self-Sufficiency Minister Peter Borg said the document was \"an insurance policy\". He said Greenland's government did not expect to have to use it. Crucially, there was no suggestion in Trump's speech of any climb down on his current threat to hit the eight European countries - he deems to be most guilty of thwarting his Arctic ambitions - with new tariffs. The proposed 10% taxes that are due to kick in from 1 February did not get a mention.\n\nAny hope in Europe that President Trump would take the sting out of this transatlantic crisis was smashed as he began to outline his uncompromising argument for taking the island. He ignored the European insistence that Greenland is sovereign EU territory and framed its acquisition as a perfectly reasonable transaction given the military support the US had provided the continent for decades. Trump insisted the US had been wrong to \"give back\" Greenland after securing it during World War Two. Greenland has never been part of the United States.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark\n\nTrump returned to his familiar refrain that the European members of Nato had done nothing for the US. He disparaged Denmark in particular when recalling how in 1940 it \"fell to Germany after just six hours of fighting and was totally unable to defend either itself or Greenland\". Trump's military history lesson failed to recall the Danes were a key partner of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan and paid a heavy price. Denmark lost 44 soldiers, proportionately more than any other ally apart from the US. They also lost personnel alongside US forces in Iraq. Many other Nato allies supported the US after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.\n\nIt was French President Emmanuel Macron who was singled out for the most jibes. He was mocked for his appearance in sunglasses on Tuesday - he had an eye problem - and his \"tough\" talking at the podium. Trump insisted he liked Macron, before continuing: \"Hard to believe, isn't it?\" But the whole joke is wearing thin for many European leaders. They have spent a year trying to flatter, impress and appease the US president and in return have been presented with their biggest threat to date.

A standing ovation. On top of that, there was an astonishing scrum to try to get in, with many turned away - even heads of state. And the security was unbelievable, not letting even some of the most famous attendees in or out of the hall. But, minutes into the speech, Trump was keeping his cool - even dropping in phrases about wanting the UK \"to do great\".\n\nWhat some thought would be the day on which the US president laid down the laws of his new global economy was filled more with grandfatherly advice. It was far from the mildly menacing tone of his social media posts claiming that Greenland will be America's. But which one is the real Donald Trump? Has he heard how badly some of his rhetoric has gone down? As I entered, I was told of an astonishing event last night where Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told the audience that, in terms of Europe's economy, \"you're dead\". There was a walkout. Might there have been one today? He seemed to be trying to avoid that.\n\nThe Speech goes rather dark\n\nAt first, I thought Trump was trying on a diplomatic front, perhaps having heard some of the significant criticism levelled against him and trying to sound mellow. He talked in friendly terms about the western allies that had been most perturbed by his social media posts. He even acknowledged that he probably shouldn't speak about the controversial issue of Greenland - which he has repeatedly vowed to take over. But, almost as though he could not help it, the speech seemed to take a dark turn. First he described America's role helping Greenland in the past, including being friendly to Denmark. But he then insulted Europe's biggest economy, saying everyone in the hall \"would be speaking German\" if it wasn't for the US. And then it came. He announced he was seeking immediate negotiations for the USA to acquire Greenland. A negotiated settlement he said. No force required. But the US needed \"full title\". \"We want this land\" to build the \"greatest Golden Dome ever built\" he said. And he warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about his words a day earlier, though stressing that he would also use Greenland to defend Canada. \"I'm asking for a piece of ice.. it's a very small ask.\" It was incredible to see this said out loud.\n\nMixed reactions in the room", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:22:59 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T19:44:09.075734"}

In a social media post, Trump said his decision followed a \"very productive meeting\" with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. \"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all Nato Nations,\" he wrote. Trump told CNBC that the deal, which he said would last \"forever\", could involve mineral rights and the planned Golden Dome missile defence system.\n\nAnnouncing his decision on Truth Social, Trump said more information would be made available \"as discussions progress\". He added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would \"report directly\" to him as negotiations proceed. No further details were provided. Trump had previously dismissed the idea of a lease agreement, saying that \"you defend ownership. You don't defend leases.\" It also remains unclear what role rare earth minerals could play. Greenland has vast - and largely untapped - reserves of rare earth minerals, many of which are crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles. Globally, the Arctic territory ranks eighth for earth minerals, according to a recent analysis from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said he was planning to place a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent from the UK to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark. The same would apply to goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland – all of which are members of Nato, the defence alliance founded in 1949. In an earlier address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said he was \"seeking immediate negotiations\" to acquire Greenland, but insisted he \"won't use force\" to take over the territory. \"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive force. We'd be unstoppable, but we won't do that,\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.\" He also urged world leaders to allow the US to take control of Greenland from Denmark, saying: \"You can say yes and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.\"\n\nUnder existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. But during his speech, Trump suggested he would not be receptive to any agreements on the US use of Greenland that fall short of full ownership. \"Psychologically, who the hell wants to defend a license agreement or a lease?\" he said. \"[Greenland] is a large piece of ice in the middle of the ocean, where if there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:04:39 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-21T22:37:27.678826"}

Egisto Ott, 63, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard. Ott denies the charges. Jan Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020.\n\nThe subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service. The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Marsalek. Prosecutors in Vienna say Egisto Ott \"abused his authority\" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements. They say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases. Prosecutors also charge him with supporting \"a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria\" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThey say Egisto Ott gave this information to Jan Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return. In 2022, prosecutors say, Jan Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service. He is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia. Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow. Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty.

We recognise that the current child sponsorship model reflects a different time.”\n\nActionAid’s supporters sponsor children in 30 countries, with the money providing 34% of the charity’s global funds, according to Ghazi.\n\nGhazi said: “We’re in the process, until 2028, of transformation that includes our systems, what money we give, how we procure services - we’re decolonising it.\n\n“We are evolving the model so it is shaped by community voices and responds to the realities they face today,” adds Bond. “We value our sponsors and remain committed to making sure their support continues to have a real impact.\n\n“Meaningful change takes time, and this work is rooted in genuine commitment rather than lip service.”\n\nView image in fullscreen The charity is hoping to establish a fund specifically for women’s rights groups that are under attack as a result of the global anti-rights movement. Photograph: Misper Apawu/ActionAid\n\nAs a method of fundraising, the process of allowing donors to choose between children to support has been likened to “poverty porn” that perpetuates racist attitudes, leading to calls for it to be phased out.\n\nCharities vary in how they spend the money raised through child sponsorship; some use the funds to support the child directly, while others spend it on projects that support the child’s community. The charities often provide the sponsors with regular updates and the opportunity to exchange letters with them.\n\nSave the Children, a pioneer of the fundraising method from when the charity was founded in 1919, ended its child sponsorship programme last year. It said it was not suitable for modern contexts and was also expensive because money that could have been spent on projects had to be used to facilitate the exchange of letters between donors and the sponsored children.\n\nBond and Ghazi’s vision for ActionAid’s future sees it as a feminist, anti-racist organisation that focuses more on fundraising through partnerships with civil society groups. One way that could work would be to encourage groups of friends or family members to form “sisterhoods” where they collectively raised money that would go towards women’s rights groups in a developing country.\n\nThey also aim to provide long-term funding to grassroots groups that give those on the ground more power over how they spend it, and are planning to launch a fund specifically for women’s rights groups that are under attack as a result of the global anti-rights movement.\n\n“ActionAid’s future is about solidarity, justice and how we can really drive forward change,” said Bond. “The world is in a bad place and we have a really important role as a global federation in pushing back on the levels of injustice that are happening all over the world.”\n\nThemrise Khan, an independent researcher on the aid sector, said the practice of marketing mostly African children to a western audience should be abandoned altogether.\n\n“The entire concept is highly problematic and racist in its overtones and shrieks ‘white saviourism’,” said Khan. “Nothing should replace it.\n\n“Better education, state welfare systems and healthcare should be the model – all responsibilities of a nation state. Not: ‘sponsor a poor African/Asian child at x dollars a month’ to make you feel good about a child you have never even seen in person, and may never see other than in a picture on your refrigerator.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-22T05:40:12.984940"}

Without it, her income dropped to zero. \"In one week I can earn up to 450,000 [Ugandan] shillings (£96; $130). That money is what I use to pay rent. Losing it was a total loss,\" she says. For two days either side of the election, there was nothing she could do but stay at home - she could only sell prepaid airtime credit, which she says does not \"give a commission\". Uganda's communications authority ordered the nationwide shutdown to \"ensure peace, protect national stability and prevent the misuse of communication platforms during a sensitive national exercise\". Th opposition said it was a move to cover up voter fraud and stop its agents from sharing the results from polling stations. Either way, it brought many aspects of modern life to a halt.\n\nAFP/Getty Images Motorcycle taxis are a common mode of transport in Uganda\n\nOnline businesses that rely on mobile money transactions were most affected by the blackout, with some coming to a standstill while others reverted to cash-based transactions. Kampala is famous for its ubiquitous boda boda (motorcycle) taxis, with many operators earning their income through online ride-hailing apps. The co-founder of SafeBoda told local media that the platform's entire server was down during the internet suspension, with many riders forced off the road and other businesses that depend on the service deprived of their income. Namukwaya Olivia, who sells traditional cultural clothing and depends heavily on Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp to reach customers, says she did not make any deliveries during the period. She tells the BBC that many of her customers ask for pictures before deciding on what to buy.\n\nNamukwaya Olivia also found it difficult to pay rent during the internet shutdown\n\n\"We could not send pictures, we could not receive orders, and we could not make deliveries,\" the businesswoman says. She adds that the effect of the shutdown was immediate, and made it difficult to cover basic costs. \"We couldn't pay rent during that period,\" she says. \"Even now, things have not fully recovered because customers still struggle to access us online.\" Journalist Ngabo Amon says his smartphone, a work tool for him, became largely useless. \"You have a phone, but there is nothing to do with it,\" he tells the BBC. He could no longer research stories, follow election developments or send material to his newsroom. He says everyday life transformed into anxious stretches of waiting for the internet to be restored. Some households reverted to watching television to keep themselves occupied, either watching live, or buying downloaded old movies from shops. \"People bought what they could afford, went back home and just watched, because there were no other options,\" Ngabo says.\n\nSome young people found it difficult to cope. Ronnie Mwesigwa, 20, says he lost contact with friends and had no access to online entertainment. \"I couldn't communicate with anyone, and even gaming was gone,\" he says. \"It was not a good situation.\" To pass his time, the gamer turned to content already stored on his phone, only viewing his gallery. \"That was all I could do.\" Ngabo explains that the situation was especially frustrating for journalists covering the election, as the blackout made it impossible to get a real picture of what was unfolding on the ground. \"You are talking about people rioting, about tension on the streets, but the audience is only seeing your photo and hearing your voice, and it is not satisfying for the journalist or the viewer,\" he points out. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide to extend his 40-year-rule and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence. Bobi Wine, his closest challenger maintains the results are \"fake\" and has cited \"ballot stuffing\". According to a report by the African Union (AU) election observation mission, \"the internet shutdown limited access to information, freedom of association [and] curtailed economic activities\". It also notes that the shutdown \"created suspicion and mistrust\" in the election process. Ngabo says that the situation was worse in rural areas. With no internet access, some journalists were forced to physically transport their footage back to their newsrooms. He gives an example of videos, made early on the morning of the elections in a remote rural area, reaching Kampala by bus in the evening. \"By that time, results are already being discussed and tallied and nobody is interested in the footage any more,\" he says. Caroline Mutai, a Kenya-based journalist who went to Uganda to cover the elections, says the shutdown \"almost gave me depression\". She describes the difficulties she faced trying to send back material to her newsroom, spending days searching for places with internet, only to be blocked or chased away. The shutdown also cut her off from family at a time of heightened insecurity. \"When you are tired and stressed after work, you want to talk to people who are close to you,\" she says. \"But you cannot reach them, and that makes the situation even harder.\"\n\nAaron Benitez says he could not study\n\nFor students, the blackout disrupted both communication and learning. Aaron Benitez, a final-year school pupil, says he was unable to contact his family during a period of uncertainty. \"I needed to know what was happening with my family and what was going on in the country,\" he tells. \"But I could not connect with them at all.\" Online learning also came to a halt. Teachers could not send notes or assignments, and group discussions normally held online were cancelled. \"Our master could not send notes on WhatsApp,\" the student says. \"We usually study online, sometimes on Zoom, but during that time everything just stopped.\" He adds that access remains slow and unreliable, despite the election being over. \"It is back, but it is still very slow. Some materials cannot load properly, and that affects our studies.\" The government partially restored the internet after Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday. Some platforms, especially social media, remain slow or restricted, pushing many young people to reconnect using a VPN (virtual private network), which can disguise its online location. For many, the shutdown was not just a temporary inconvenience but a stark reminder of how deeply digital access shapes their everyday life.\n\nGetty Images/BBC", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 04:14:19 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-22T07:33:46.735216"}

The deaths were reported at Welcome Bay, while rescue workers are still searching through rubble at a different site in a popular campground on Mount Maunganui. There are no \"signs of life\", authorities said, adding that they have a \"rough idea\" of how many people are missing but are waiting for an exact figure.

The statement came as a surprise after days of mounting tensions, culminating with a threat to impose economic sanctions on eight close US allies which have opposed his plans to seize the semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. So what could this deal entail and will it be acceptable to Denmark and Greenland - both of which have made it clear they will not relinquish sovereignty of the world's largest island.\n\nWhat has been said about the framework deal?\n\nPresident Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday, after talks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland,\" he said. \"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all Nato Nations.\" He did not give details, but said talks would continue to reach the deal. Rutte, for his part, said he had not discussed the key issue of Danish sovereignty over Greenland in his meeting with Trump. The view in Denmark is that the issue is far from over and that any agreement must still be hammered out together between Greenland and Denmark and the US. Danish Prime Minister Metter Frederiksen said she been having regular conversations with Rutte and the Danes could negotiate \"on everything political; security, investments, economy\". \"But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty. I have been informed that this has not been the case either,\" she said in a statement on Thursday. Nato spokeswoman Allison Hart said in a statement after the meeting between Trump and Rutte: \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland.\" However, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament Aaja Chenmitz said \"Nato in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us\". The UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she hoped this meant that there would be \"the direct discussions that Denmark had asked for, for Denmark, Greenland and the United States on the way forward around Greenland, protecting Greenland's sovereignty\".\n\nIs there any detail about the possible deal?\n\nDenmark and Greenland's comments about sovereignty being non-negotiable. appeared to push back on reports that among the ideas being mooted unofficially is an arrangement similar to two military bases in Cyprus which are controlled by the UK. The New York Times quotes anonymous officials as saying one idea under discussion is for Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases, as in the UK model. Akrotiri and Dhekelia have been under UK sovereignty since Cyprus became independent in 1960. That treaty has been modified since, but essentially it is considered British territory. Asked whether whether she knew what was in the framework agreement, Yvette Cooper said only that there were two things that she now expected to happen. \"The first is a return to some of the discussions that Denmark and Greenland had asked for with the United States, where they had begun those discussions in Washington last week and that's what they want to focus on,\" the UK foreign secretary said. \"It's some very practical discussions about Greenland's security, whilst being very, very clear that Greenland sovereignty is not up for negotiation.\" In arguing in favour of seizing Greenland, Trump has mentioned the threat of Chinese and Russian vessels around the island, even though defence officials insist there has been no increased threat from Russia and China recently. On this point, Nato allies have tried to reassure the US that they will boost up security in the Arctic and Mark Rutte told Reuters news agency on Thursday that the framework deal would also require this contribution. \"We will come together in Nato with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary,\" he said, adding: \"I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026.\" One of the ideas the UK has been calling for is to set up an Arctic Sentry, said Yvette Cooper on Thursday - which was a \"very similar to the approach that Nato has taken to the Baltic sentry\" - a mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were severed.\n\nWill any deal short of 'ownership' please Trump?\n\nThe US has had a military presence in Greenland since after World War Two. Under a 1951 agreement with Denmark, the US can bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. The US does have military bases in many countries - including Germany - but they do not constitute sovereign territory. Trump has insisted a lease agreement over Greenland is not good enough. \"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" he said two weeks ago. In order to acquire the island, he has threatened to use force - until a U-turn in Davos where he dropped that threat to the relief of his Nato allies. Nato was founded in 1949 on the principle that an attack on one ally is an attack on all. These attacks were meant to come from outside, and Denmark had made it clear a military attack would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance, where the US is the major partner.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland?\n\nTrump has sought to buy Greenland off Denmark since his first time in office - and he is not the only US president to try to do so. Trump says the US needs Greenland to protect against possible attacks from Russia and China. He has also said Greenland is essential for his plan to build a Golden Dome defence system, designed to protect the US against missile attacks, and that European allies could co-operate in this endeavour.

What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country. The gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month's push, nearly a third of Syria's territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm.\n\nEPA President Ahmed al-Sharaa signed a 14-point agreement with the SDF on Sunday\n\nThe offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa's government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country's institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally. But the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa's forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection.\n\nAFP Syrian Kurds stand to lose the autonomy they enjoyed for more than a decade\n\nOn Sunday, after suffering stunning territorial losses, the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations. Crucially, its members are expected to join the Syrian army and interior ministry as individuals - and not as separate units, as it had demanded - while the control of oil and gas fields, important for Syria's economic recovery, will be transferred to the government. SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus' control. The announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday. Fighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF. But the troops continued to move towards Kurdish-majority areas, raising the prospect of deadly clashes, and reportedly angering Washington. On Tuesday, Sharaa's government suddenly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF four days to present a detailed plan for the integration of areas under its control into the state. This halted the move of his army and prevented the escalation of the violence, for now.\n\nEPA Government forces took control of al-Hol camp for IS families after SDF fighters withdrew", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:08:12 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-22T14:40:11.449034"}

The film beat the previous record of 14 nominations, and emerged ahead of its nearest rival this year, Leonardo DiCaprio's thriller One Battle After Another, which is up for 13 awards. Sinners' contenders include its star Michael B Jordan and his British co-stars Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo. Other big names up for trophies include Timothée Chalamet, who is hoping for third time lucky after two previous nominations, and Irish actress Jessie Buckley, who is the frontrunner to win best actress for Hamnet.\n\nUniversal Jessie Buckley is frontrunner to win best picture for Hamnet\n\nHowever, there was no space for her co-star Paul Mescal, who starred opposite Buckley as William Shakespeare in Hamnet; while Wicked: For Good and its stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande missed out completely. The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Hollywood on 15 March.\n\nThe leading films: Sinners - 16\n\nOne Battle After Another - 13\n\nMarty Supreme - 9\n\nFrankenstein - 9\n\nSentimental Value - 9\n\nHamnet - 8\n\nSinners 'more than just a horror'\n\nSinners has exceeded expectations and bucked the trend that normally means horror films don't perform well at award ceremonies. Michael B Jordan is nominated for best actor for playing twin brothers who return home to Mississippi in the 1930s to set up a juke joint, which is set upon by blood-sucking vampires. Other Sinners cast members to be nominated include British-Nigerian actress Wunmi Mosaku and co-star Delroy Lindo, who grew up in London, and the pair are carrying Britain's hopes for acting awards this year. Ryan Coogler is nominated for directing, writing and producing Sinners, with the film also shortlisted for the Oscars' top prize, best picture.\n\nWarner Bros Wunmi Mosaku and Michael B Jordan are both nominated for their performances in Sinners\n\nBBC Radio 1 film critic Ali Plumb said: \"The last time anything to do with a horror won best picture was The Silence of the Lambs in the early 1990s. That is a long time ago.\" He said it was good to see Sinners get \"this broad a series of accolades and thumbs up from across the whole industry\". It is \"more than just a horror\", he added. \"Although obviously vampires are obviously involved, there's so much more to it.\" BBC culture editor Katie Razzall said: \"It is to my mind the perfect blend of revenge thriller and sexy, decadent, musical journey through America's race issues, good against evil, the power of music - and redemption. \"Who knew that combining vampires, KKK racists, ex-gangster twins (both played by Michael B Jordan), Mississippi delta folklore and blues history would pay off so spectacularly?\" The previous record total of 14 nominations was achieved by All About Eve in 1951, Titanic in 1998 and La La Land in 2018. Sinners' total this year has been boosted by the addition of a new award, for best casting, although the number of categories has fluctuated over the years.\n\nLosing the battle but winning the war?\n\nWarner Bros Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor for his role in One Battle After Another\n\nWhile Sinners deals with the spectre of racism in the American South, One Battle After Another gives a take on the current messy political climate in the US. Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor for playing a revolutionary battling an authoritarian US regime, whose past comes back to haunt him. The film has also scooped nominations for supporting cast members Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Teyana Taylor, as well as director Paul Thomas Anderson. It has been the presumed favourite to win best picture throughout award season so far, and it could still pip Sinners to the top trophy in March. The frontrunner in the nominations doesn't always turn out to be the big winner on the night. In the past 21 years, the movie with the most nominations has gone on to win best picture just six times. Either way, the nominations are good news for Warner Bros, which made both Sinners and One Battle After Another, as it is in the process of being sold, possibly to Netflix.\n\nChalamet eyes first Oscar\n\nA24 Marty Supreme has earned Timothee Chalamet the third Oscar nomination of his career, but he's yet to win\n\nDiCaprio and Jordan will face stiff competition from Timothee Chalamet, who is hotly tipped to win his first Oscar for his role in table tennis caper Marty Supreme. At 30, he has become the youngest man to receive three acting nominations since Marlon Brando. This year's best actor category is completed by Ethan Hawke, who has his fifth Oscar nomination for Blue Moon, and Brazilian actor Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent). At 37, Emma Stone has become the youngest woman to accumulate seven Oscar nominations after being recognised for Bugonia. She is listed for best actress alongside Kate Hudson (Song Sung Blue), Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs I'd Kick You) and Norway's Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value) - but Buckley is regarded as the clear favourite in that race. Moura and Reinsve are among a record four acting nominations for non-English language performances - the others being Sweden's Stellan Skarsgård and Norwegian actress Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, who are both in supporting categories for Sentimental Value.\n\nKPop characters v rock stars", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:10:44 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-22T17:16:58.116099"}

Slides showed dozens of skyscrapers stretching along the Mediterranean coast and housing estates in the Rafah area, while a map outlining the phased development of new residential, agricultural and industrial areas for the 2.1 million population. They were presented during a signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos for President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace, which is tasked with ending the two-year war between Israel and Hamas and overseeing reconstruction. \"We're going to be very successful in Gaza. It's going to be a great thing to watch,\" Trump declared.\n\n\"I'm a real estate person at heart and it's all about location. And I said: 'Look at this location on the sea. Look at this beautiful piece of property. What it could be for so many people.'\"\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who helped broker the ceasefire that took effect in October, said 90,000 tonnes of munitions had been dropped on Gaza and there were 60 million tonnes of rubble to clear. \"In the beginning, we were toying with the idea of saying: 'Let's build a free zone, and then we have a Hamas zone.' And then we said: 'You know what, let's just plan for catastrophic success',\" he told the ceremony. \"Hamas signed a deal to demilitarise, that is what we are going to enforce.

A new seaport and airport would be built near the Egyptian border, and there would a \"trilateral crossing\" where the Egyptian and Israeli borders converge. Redevelopment would be divided into four phases, starting in Rafah and then gradually moving north towards Gaza City. The map also featured an empty strip of land running along the Egyptian and Israeli borders. It appeared to mark what Trump's 20-point peace plan refers to as the \"security perimeter\" where Israeli forces will remain \"until Gaza is properly secure\".\n\nWhite House\n\nAnother slide said \"New Rafah\" would have more than 100,000 permanent housing units, 200 education centres and 75 medical facilities. About 280,000 people once lived in Gaza's southernmost city, but it has been largely levelled by Israeli strikes and controlled demolitions during the war and is currently located inside Israeli-controlled territory. Kushner said he believed it was \"doable\" to complete the construction of \"New Rafah\" in two to three years. \"We've already started removing the rubble and doing some of the demolition. And then New Gaza. It could be a hope, it could be a destination, have a lot of industry.\" In the coming weeks, he added, there would be a conference in Washington where contributions from countries would be announced and \"amazing investment opportunities\" for the private sector outlined. Last February, Trump sparked outrage around the world when he suggested that Gaza's Palestinians could be permanently relocated to neighbouring countries, with the US taking over the territory to transform it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East\".\n\nWhite House\n\nKushner also declared that the demilitarisation of Gaza was \"starting now\", noting that \"without security nobody is going to make investments\". He said the territory's new technocratic Palestinian government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), would be \"working with Hamas on demilitarisation to really take the principles that were agreed to in the document to the next phase\". Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state. But Trump warned the group: \"They have to give up their weapons and if they don't do that, it's going to be the end of them.\"\n\nWhite House\n\nTrump also insisted Hamas hand over the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza, which Israel said should have happened before phase two of the peace plan began last week. Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of all living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid. The ceasefire has remained fragile, with at least 477 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes over the past three months, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups. Five people were reportedly killed by Israeli fire across Gaza on Thursday, four of them in an artillery strike in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City. Humanitarian conditions also still dire, with almost 1 million people lacking adequate shelter and 1.6 million facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the UN.\n\nReuters Five Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli fire across Gaza on Thursday despite the ceasefire", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:55:57 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-22T22:34:06.714703"}
{"title": "Could Trump's bid to become peacemaker-in-chief sideline the struggling UN?", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8jj228g2vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "summary": "The US president has promised to \"end decades of suffering\" but critics dismiss his Board of Peace as a vainglorious project.", "content": "Could Trump's bid to become peacemaker-in-chief sideline the struggling UN?\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Lyse Doucet Chief international correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC\n\n\"Together we are in a position to… end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed, and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region and for the whole region of the world.\" Such was the soaring promise of US President Donald Trump as he inaugurated his new Board of Peace on the stage of stages that is the Davos Economic Forum this week. The world of all too much suffering and strife badly wants to believe him. But for many observers and officials in capitals the world over, it is yet more proof of Trump's drive to dismantle the post-war international architecture and replace it with new institutions - dominated by him. \"We will not let anyone play us,\" Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned tersely on social media.\n\nReuters The idea - born last year in US-led efforts to end the war in Gaza and endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution - now has a much greater, far grander, more global ambition\n\nBut from Trump's biggest backer in Europe, Viktor Orban, came effusive praise: \"If Trump, then peace.\" What exactly will this Board, headed in perpetuity by Trump himself, do? Could this really be a bid to build a UN mini-me?\n\nPower of the Board chairman\n\nThe idea - born last year in US-led efforts to end the war in Gaza and endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution - now has a much greater, far grander, more global ambition. And it pivots around the president. In leaked details of the draft charter he is the Board's chairman for life even when he leaves office. Under that charter his powers would be vast: authority to invite member states or not; to create or dissolve subsidiary bodies; and the mandate to appoint his successor whenever he decides to step down, or if he is incapacitated. If any other country would like to become a permanent member, the price is an eye-watering $1 billion (£740m). This latest bombshell lands in what is already a head-spinning month. In a few short weeks there's already been the US capture of Venezuela's leader, Trump threats and preparations for military action against Iran, and demands to acquire Greenland which sent shock waves across Europe and beyond.\n\nReuters 'Once this Board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do and we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,' Trump has said\n\nNineteen countries showed up in Davos for the Board's inauguration from all corners of the compass - from Argentina to Azerbaijan, from former Soviet republics to Gulf kingdoms. Many more are said to have \"agreed to join\". \"In this group, I like every single one of them,\" Trump grinned as he eyed leaders and officials whose names are now on this Board or the layers of executive bodies beneath it. Many more potential members have so far politely demurred. \"This is about a treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that is talking about peace\" explained the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.\n\nTrump says Russia is on board although the message from Moscow was that they were still \"consulting partners\". \"As the text stands right now,\" we're not joining, replied Sweden. \"The proposal raises unanswered questions that require further dialogue with Washington\" was Norway's diplomatic response. Even a group of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including six Arab nations, as well as Turkey and Indonesia, made it clear they were in it for a \"just and lasting peace in Gaza,\" including the reconstruction of the shattered enclave. However leaked details of the Board's charter don't mention Gaza.\n\nReuters Prime Minister Robert Golob made his concern about the Board clear – it \"dangerously interferes with the broader international order\"\n\nFor some of the critics, including some countries reluctant to join, it's a vainglorious project for a president who doesn't hide his fixation with winning the biggest accolade – the Nobel Peace Prize, which was was won by President Obama in 2009 at the start of his first term in the White House. World leaders know there may be a price to pay for not joining this new club. \"I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join.\" This was the president's rebuke to France's President Emmanuel Macron with a threat to wield his weapon of choice. Only Slovenia said the quiet part out loud. Prime Minister Robert Golob made his concern clear – it \"dangerously interferes with the broader international order\". Trump addressed this concern head-on. \"Once this Board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do and we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he explained to the packed hall hanging on his every word. But he likes to keep the world guessing. A day earlier, when asked by a Fox TV journalist whether his Board would replace the UN, he replied \"Well it might. The UN just hasn't been very helpful.\" Then he added \"I'm a big fan of the UN potential, but it has never lived up to its potential. The UN should have settled every one of the wars that I settled.\"\n\nA new contender for peacemaker-in-chief?\n\nThe UN, 193 members strong, has indeed long lost its role as peacemaker-in-chief. When I interviewed the Secretary General António Guterres in October 2016, on his first day in his first term, just hours after a rare unanimous endorsement by the Security Council, he promised \"a surge in diplomacy for peace\". For the past decade, the UN's efforts were thwarted by the gridlocked Security Council, the growing number of spoilers and state sponsors in wars the world over, as well as the steady erosion in its own standing vis-a-vis the world's most powerful players, including the United States. \"We must all welcome the activism of Mr Trump on ending wars,\" says Martin Griffiths, a UN veteran who believes this new effort is \"obviously a reflection of the failure of the UN Security Council and of the UN writ large.\" But the former Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator cautioned that \"what we've learned over these last 80 years, through lots and lots of failures and clunkiness, we learned the value of inclusion, of being representative of the global community, not just the friends of Mr Trump.\" Guterres himself recently regretted that \"there are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power\". Asked in an interview with the BBC's Today programme about Trump's constant claim that he's ended eight wars, he replied matter-of-factly \"they are ceasefires.\" Some have already broken down. The temporary peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo soon fell apart, Cambodia and Thailand started hurling accusations and more across their border, and India disputed Trump's central role in ending its conflagration with Pakistan.\n\nEPA As this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nBut only Trump's muscular mediation could have ended the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. His own personal involvement finally secured a ceasefire in Gaza's destructive confrontation last October which eased both the suffering of Palestinians, and the agony of Israeli hostages. His decision to finally and fully focus on this disaster, partly in response to urging from his closest Arab allies and grieving Israeli families, pushed him to pressure Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas, to do a deal. But even the Board's first test – to move from the first phase of the deal to end the Gaza war – is daunting. Even now, as this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Netanyahu who has vowed to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Arab leaders who insist the only pathway to a sustainable peace must lead to Palestinian self-governance and the end of Israeli occupation. And the other big war on America's - and Europe's agenda - is Ukraine. President Zelensky has balked at being at the same table as Moscow and Minsk. Three layers lie beneath this Board, most focusing on Gaza – an Executive Board, a Gaza Executive Board, and the National Committee for the Administration for Gaza. They bring together a mix of senior American officials and billionaires, as well as respected former politicians and ex-UN envoys who know Gaza well, along with Arab ministers and intelligence chiefs, and Palestinian technocrats.\n\nReuters Three layers lie beneath this Board, most focusing on Gaza\n\nEven some critics credit the president with putting an age-old battle of a different kind on the table – the incessant demand to reform the UN's post-war architecture including a Security Council which no longer aligns with the world's political map of major powers in every region. It's simply not fit for purpose. \"Maybe an unintended good consequence of what Trump has done is those issues will be pushed back towards the top of the international agenda,\" reflected Mark Malloch Brown, the former UN deputy secretary-general. \"We're coming out of a period of extremely weak UN leadership and I think this could be a call to action.\" Ironically, Trump's bid to lead the world towards peace comes as discussions gather steam in many capitals to replace Guterres who completes his second term at the end of this year. The president, who previously declared that he could end the Ukraine war in a day, has learned in his last year in power that peacemaking is a protracted and perilous process. But today he hailed a Middle East region where only \"little fires\" were burning now. He promised that a settlement in Ukraine \"is coming very soon\". And he revelled in his new role as would-be peacemaker-in-chief. \"This is for the world\" he exclaimed.\n\nTop picture credit: Reuters", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:40:18 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23T02:09:18.202912"}
{"title": "Eight surprise takeaways from the Oscar nominations", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3zzv40422o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "summary": "Paul Mescal and Chase Infiniti missed out, while other actors carried their films to a nomination.", "content": "Eight surprise takeaways from the Oscar nominations\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter Share Save\n\nWatch: Who got nominated and who got snubbed?\n\nAwards pundits were taken by surprise from the first two words spoken at the Oscar nominations on Thursday. \"Elle Fanning, for Sentimental Value,\" said hosts Danielle Brooks and Lewis Pullman, as they kicked off the nominations with the best supporting actress category. Fanning's appearance got things off to a spicy start from the earliest possible moment - she had received praise for her performance in the Norwegian family drama but few had predicted a nomination. The opening category set the tone for a string of snubs and surprises, which started coming thick and fast. Here are eight of the big takeaways.\n\n1. Some hot favourites missed out\n\nGetty Images Paul Mescal and Chase Infiniti were two of the day's biggest acting snubs\n\nAlthough Hamnet and One Battle After Another did well, both had a slightly softer showing than expected in the acting categories. Paul Mescal missed out on a supporting actor nod for Hamnet - a surprising omission, although we're confident it won't have much impact on his co-star Jessie Buckley's frontrunner status for best actress. Meanwhile, four big actors from One Battle After Another were recognised, but its break-out star Chase Infiniti missed best actress despite being a red-hot contender. It was an admittedly competitive category. But at 25 years old and with rave reviews for her performance in the film, we're pretty sure we haven't heard the last of her. Other actors who had momentum but ended up missing included Jesse Plemons for Bugonia and Joel Edgerton for Train Dreams. But both of those movies made it into best picture - so the Academy clearly liked them overall.\n\n2. F1 is a comfort-food movie\n\nGetty Images\n\nF1, which stars Brad Pitt as a racing driver brought out of retirement, was the biggest surprise in the best picture category. It wasn't exactly an outsider - many awards pundits expected it to pick up several below-the-line nominations for its impressive technical achievements (we recommend watching the film in a cinema or with surround sound if you can). But the fact that it had enough momentum to propel it into best picture was a real show of strength - especially without other major nominations in best director or the acting categories. It shows the old guard of the Academy still appreciates traditional, well-made films that can simply be enjoyed with a bucket of popcorn.\n\n3. Sinners were the big winners\n\nGetty Images Ryan Coogler was nominated for best director, while Michael B Jordan is up for best actor\n\nSinners scored a record-breaking 16 nominations, flying way past the previous joint record holders La La Land, Titanic and All About Eve, which got 14 each. Ryan Coogler's vampire horror has done particularly well to maintain its momentum with voters, considering it was released last spring. But it's exactly the kind of film the Academy would want to recognise. Although vampire movies might not be traditional Oscars bait, Sinners was a real artistic achievement, blending genre horror with 1930s blues music against a backdrop of the Mississippi Delta. Coogler also made headlines in the Hollywood trade publications last year for the deal he negotiated with Warner Brothers, which will see the film's ownership rights return to him after 25 years.\n\n4. Wicked did not bewitch the Academy\n\nGetty Images Ariana Grande's The Girl in the Bubble missed the original song category\n\nThe first Wicked film received 10 Oscar nominations and went on to win two. So it's an extraordinary fall from grace for its sequel to have got zero. This was largely expected, however. Wicked: For Good was far less well received than its predecessor - something it shares with the original musical. The second act of the stage show is widely considered weaker than the first, partly because all the big hits appear before the interval. But it was still thought that Wicked: For Good could get into some categories, with many predicting a best original song nomination for The Girl in the Bubble, a track performed by Ariana Grande that was newly added for the film adaptation. There was better news for another blockbuster, Avatar: Fire and Ash, which at least managed a couple of technical nominations for visual effects and costume design. Some of the most mainstream films can instead be found in the animated category. That's where we find the $1.7bn-grossing Zootopia 2 (known as Zootropolis 2 in the UK) and viral streaming hit KPop Demon Hunters.\n\n5. The Brits showed up\n\nGetty Images In a year short on Brits, Sinners stars Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo both scored nominations\n\nSinners didn't just score the highest number of nominations, it also delivered the only two Brits to be nominated in the acting categories. Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo made it into best supporting actress and actor respectively. While Mosaku's was broadly expected, Lindo's was more of a surprise, and his inclusion is perhaps one of the biggest indicators of how much love there clearly is for Sinners across the Academy. Lindo narrowly missed a best actor nomination a few years ago for Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods. The 73-year-old's first ever Oscar nomination feels long overdue.\n\n6. Several actresses carried their films to a nomination\n\nGetty Images Left to right: Kate Hudson, Rose Byrne and Amy Madigan\n\nThree of the actresses nominated on Thursday ended up being the only recognition their film received. Rose Byrne was the sole representation for motherhood drama If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, while Kate Hudson made it in on her own for the touching musical love story Song Sung Blue. Meanwhile, Weapons star Amy Madigan was nominated for her role as an eccentric aunt who shows up in a US town just before the local school children go missing. Madigan's nomination is perhaps the most impressive, given that jump-scare horror movies aren't traditional Oscars fodder. But the 75-year-old was a passion pick for many pundits and voters, and her fans have been campaigning hard for her to be recognised for her memorable (and slightly terrifying) performance.\n\n7. New category is a mixed bag\n\nGetty Images Sentimental Value missed a casting nomination despite four individual acting nods\n\nThe newly introduced casting category overlapped with many of the general frontrunners, with nominations for Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another, Hamnet, Sinners and The Secret Agent. We can't help but feel slightly bemused, however, that one other film in particular missed out. Sentimental Value failed to score a casting nomination despite all four of its lead stars scoring individual nods - Stellan Skarsgård, Elle Fanning, Renate Reinsve and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas. If that quartet was impressive enough to be nominated individually, you might've thought there was a good chance of recognition for the casting directors who put them together - Avy Kaufman and Yngvill Kolset Haga.\n\n8.

Labour MP Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, called it an \"absolute insult\" to the 457 British service personnel killed in the conflict, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"How dare he question their sacrifice?\" Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan, said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply\". The UK was among several allies to join the US in Afghanistan from 2001, after it invoked Nato's collective security clause following the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nThe US president told Fox News on Thursday that he was \"not sure\" the military alliance would be there for America \"if we ever needed them\". \"We've never needed them,\" he said, adding: \"We have never really asked anything of them.\" \"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan,\" he said, \"and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\". He said the US had \"been very good to Europe and to many other countries\", adding: \"It has to be a two-way street.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nThornberry told the BBC's Question Time that the remarks were \"much more than a mistake\". \"It's an absolute insult... How dare he say we weren't on the front line, how dare he? \"We have always been there whenever the Americans have wanted us,\" she said, calling Trump \"a man who has never seen any action\" but was now \"commander in chief and knows nothing about how it is that America has been defended\". She said the US was the UK's \"friend\" but its leader had \"behaved in a way that is bullying, rude, that has deliberately been trying to undermine us, which has been trying to undermine Nato.\" On the same programme, Conservative shadow cabinet member Stuart Andrew also called the comments \"disgraceful\" and \"appalling\". \"There are many people in this country who served both in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom lost their lives, but also many more who came back with life-changing injuries and we should say thank you to them.\" He added that the UK-US special relationship was important for both defence and security, and that in recent weeks Trump had directed conversation to the security of the Arctic - where he said there was a \"very serious threat\".\n\nPA Media 457 British service personnel were killed in the conflict in Afghanistan\n\nSir Ed wrote on social media that Trump had \"avoided military service\", adding: \"How dare he question their sacrifice?\" Speaking to BBC's Newsnight programme, Dutch foreign minister David van Weel rejected Trump's remarks as \"false\", saying \"Europeans shed blood\" in support of US troops in Afghanistan. He said Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte had rebuffed similar comments Trump made earlier, during a joint press conference the pair held at Davos on Thursday. Asked about the US president repeating the claim, van Weel, said: \"We should speak out for the truth as Mark Rutte did. And if he repeated it, we need to repeat it again because that's not how history went.\" Meanwhile, former British Army officer Obese-Jecty said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States\". \"I saw first hand the sacrifices made by British soldiers,\" he wrote on X. \"I don't believe US military personnel share the view of President Trump; his words do them a disservice as our closest military allies.\" Calvin Bailey, a Labour MP and former RAF officer who served alongside US special operations units in Afghanistan, said the president's claim bore \"no resemblance to the reality experienced by those of us who served there\". \"As I reminded the US Forces I served with on 4 July 2008, we were there because of a shared belief, articulated at America's founding, that free people have inalienable rights and should not live under tyranny,\" he told the PA news agency. \"That belief underpinned the response to 9/11, and it is worth reflecting on now.\"\n\nThe BBC approached the Ministry of Defence for comment. A spokesperson pointed to comments made by Defence Secretary John Healey while visiting Nato ally Denmark on Wednesday - before Trump's comments. He said: \"In Afghanistan, our forces trained together, they fought together, and on some occasions, they died together, making the ultimate sacrifice.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 01:34:42 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23T06:50:19.540474"}

One former detainee told the BBC he had been beaten and sexually abused at one of the sites. We saw cells at two bases in the south of the country, including shipping containers with names - apparently of detainees - and dates scratched into the sides. The UAE did not respond to our request for comment, but has previously denied similar allegations. Until recently, the Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, was allied with the UAE against the Houthi rebel movement which controls north-west Yemen. But the alliance between Yemen's two Gulf state partners has fractured. UAE forces pulled out of Yemen in early January and Yemeni government forces and groups allied to them have retaken large swathes of the south from separatists backed by the UAE. This includes the port of Mukalla, where we landed in a Saudi military plane and were taken to visit the former UAE military bases in the Al-Dhaba Oil Export Area. It has been almost impossible for international journalists to get visas to report from Yemen in recent years, but the government invited reporters to view the two sites, accompanied by Yemen's Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani. What we saw was consistent with accounts we have gathered independently, both in our previous reporting and also interviews conducted in Yemen, separately from the government-run site visit.\n\n'No space to lie down'\n\nAt one site, there were about 10 shipping containers, their interiors painted black, with little ventilation. Messages on the walls appeared to mark the dates detainees said they were brought in, or to count the number of days they had been held. Several were dated as recently as December 2025. At another military base, the BBC was shown eight cells built from brick and cement, including several measuring about one metre square and two metres tall, which Eryani said were used for solitary confinement.\n\nLiam Weir / BBC One site had several cells that were about a metre square, which the Yemeni government said were used for solitary confinement\n\nHuman rights groups have documented testimony describing such facilities for years. Yemeni lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been gathering accounts. The BBC independently attended a meeting she organised, where about 70 people were present who said they had been held in Mukalla, as well as the families of another 30 who they said their relatives were still in detention. Several former detainees told us that each shipping container could hold up to 60 men at a time. They said prisoners were blindfolded, bound at the wrists and forced to remain sitting upright at all hours. \"There was no space to lie down,\" one former prisoner told the BBC. \"If someone collapsed, the others had to hold him up.\"\n\n'All types of torture'\n\nThe man also told the BBC he was beaten for three days after his arrest, with interrogators demanding he confess to being a member of al-Qaeda. \"They told me if I didn't admit it, I would be sent to 'Guantanamo',\" he said, referring to the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. \"I didn't even know what they meant by Guantanamo until they took me to their prison. Then I understood.\" He said he was held there for a year and a half, beaten daily and abused. \"They didn't even feed us properly,\" he said. \"If you wanted the toilet, they took you once. Sometimes you were so desperate you did it on yourself.\" He says his captors included Emirati soldiers as well as Yemeni fighters: \"All types of torture - when we were interrogated it was the worst. They even sexually abused us and said they would bring in the 'doctor'. \"This so-called doctor was Emirati. He beat us and told the Yemeni soldiers to beat us too. I tried to kill myself multiple times to make it end.\"\n\nLiam Weir / BBC Dates were scratched into the black sides of the shipping containers\n\nThe UAE was leading a counter-terror campaign in southern Yemen, but human rights groups say thousands of people were detained in crackdowns on political activists and critics. A mother told us her son was detained as a teenager and has been held for nine years. \"My son was an athlete,\" she said. \"He had just come back from competing abroad. That day he went to the gym and never came back.\" \"I didn't hear from him for seven months,\" she said. \"Then they let me see him for 10 minutes. I could see all the scars of the torture.\" She alleged that in the prison at the Emirati-run base, her teenage son was electrocuted, doused with ice-cold water and sexually abused multiple times. She says she attended a hearing in which her son's accusers played a recording of him apparently confessing. \"You can hear him being beaten in the background and told what to say,\" she said. \"My son is not a terrorist. You have robbed him of the best years of his life.\"\n\nTestimony and allegations\n\nOver the past decade, human rights groups and media organisations - including the BBC and Associated Press - have documented allegations of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture in detention centres run by the UAE and its allies. Human Rights Watch said in 2017 it had gathered testimonies of detainees held without charge or judicial oversight in unofficial facilities, and subjected to beatings, electric shocks and other forms of ill treatment. The UAE denied these allegations when they were made. The BBC sent detailed allegations to the UAE government about the detention sites we visited and accounts of abuse, but received no response. All sides have been accused of human rights violations in the civil war, which has sparked a devastating humanitarian crisis in the country.\n\nFamilies' questions\n\nFadel SENNA / AFP via Getty Image Minister Moammar al-Eryani said victims had told the government the prisons existed, \"but we didn't believe it was true\"\n\nFamilies of detainees told the BBC they had repeatedly raised concerns with Yemeni authorities. They believe it would have been impossible for the UAE and its allies to run a detention network without the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers knowing about it. The information minister, Eryani, said: \"We weren't able to access locations that were under UAE control until now. \"When we liberated them we discovered these prisons… we had been told by many victims that they existed but we didn't believe it was true.\"\n\nHis government's decision to give access to international media comes as the rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is widening. Their long-strained relationship deteriorated in December when UAE-backed southern separatists, the Southern Transition Council (STC), seized territory controlled by government forces in two western provinces.

Canada had indicated that while it would not pay to be on the board, it would join. Meanwhile, EU chief Antonio Costa said European leaders have serious doubts about the scope of the board, but were willing to work with the body in Gaza.\n\nThe board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts. Trump did not give a reason in Thursday evening's post as to why he had decided to revoke Canada's offer. Carney's office did not immediately respond. The prime minster had indicated last week he would accept Trump's invite on principle. But Ottawa had indicated in recent days that it would not pay the $1bn (£740m) membership fee which Trump has said permanent members will be asked to pay to help fund the board. Trump's Board of Peace was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction.\n\nBBC looks into who is and isn't on Trump's Board of Peace\n\nBut its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN. Trump would be chairman for life. Some 60 nations have been invited to join the board and about 35 have already signed up, according to the White House. Those who have agreed to join so far include Argentina, Belarus, Morocco, Vietnam, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kosovo, Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. But none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far. The UK has expressed concerns about the inclusion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces are fighting in Ukraine after invading in 2022. France said the charter as it currently stood was \"incompatible\" with its international commitments, especially its UN membership. European Council president Antonio Costa said European leaders have doubts about the scope of the board, but were ready to work with the US and the newly founded body in Gaza. Speaking on Friday after an EU leaders' summit in Brussels, Costa said, \"We have serious doubts about a number of elements in the charter of the Board of Peace related to its scope, its governance and its compatibility with the UN Charter.\" But he said the EU was \"ready to work together with the US on the implementation of the comprehensive Peace Plan for Gaza, with a Board of Peace carrying out its mission as a transitional administration\". After the EU leaders' summit, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters that his country had \"declined\" the invitation to participate in the body.\n\nWatch: Board of Peace, Zelensky and Musk - What happened before Trump left Davos?\n\nTrump's withdrawal of Canada's invitation came after Carney appeared to irk Trump with a speech that won a rare standing ovation this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The prime minister urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", although he did not mention the US president by name. A day later Trump told the gathering in the Swiss Alpine resort that Canada gets many \"freebies\" from the US and it \"should be grateful\". \"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said. \"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\" On Thursday, Carney swiped back at Trump as he delivered another speech back on home turf. Speaking in Quebec, he said: \"Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadians.\"", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:16:46 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23T11:31:59.075020"}

Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has used hundreds of ageing tankers with obscured ownership - known as the shadow fleet - to evade sanctions on its oil exports. The BBC understands that the UK government received legal assurances earlier this month that such vessels can be detained. Yet 42 sanctioned tankers tracked by BBC Verify passing through the English Channel did so after that advice was received.\n\nAmong them was the Sofos - a tanker sanctioned by the UK Foreign Office in May 2025. It moved through the Channel after travelling from Venezuela and is now near the Russian city of St Petersburg. Ship-tracking data shows the Sofos loaded oil in Russia in mid-November, before travelling to Turkey and then to Venezuela, where it switched off its tracking signal. Satellite imagery later placed it at Venezuela's Jose oil terminal on 22 and 23 December, before its signal reappeared outside the country's waters on 26 December.\n\nThe Nasledie, a tanker which is more than 20 years old, also entered the Channel in January. The ship was sanctioned by the UK in May 2025 and according to Anna Zhminko, an analyst at Maritime Intelligence firm Vortexa, has been part of the shadow fleet since 2023. In November the ship had a makeover, changing its name from Blint and switching to a Russian registry after falsely flying under the Comoros flag. It left Russia in late December and just days after the BBC reported on the UK's legal advice it entered the Channel carrying about 100,000 tonnes of Urals crude, Russia's flagship oil grade. The shadow fleet has helped Russia to mitigate the impact of an embargo imposed on its oil exports since 2022 and has helped prop up an economy battered by Western sanctions. In January, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the British government was ready to \"tighten the chokehold\" on Russia and take new \"assertive actions\" against shadow fleet vessels. Her comments came after officials were told troops could board and seize tankers under the Sanctions and Money Act 2018. While the UK has aided US forces to seize a tanker near Iceland in early January and France in the Mediterranean on Thursday, British troops are yet to independently seize any shadow fleet vessels. This is despite BBC Verify identifying six tankers operating in the Channel under false flags since the beginning of January. This means the ships are not registered in the states they publicly claim to be registered in. Under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea such tankers can be seized as stateless vessels. Dame Emily Thornberry, chair of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said she was \"very disappointed\" that the vessels had not been intercepted. \"I think in order to give Ukraine proper support, we have to have not only sanctions that look on paper, but we have to make sure we mean it and that we implement those sanctions,\" she said.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMike Martin, a Liberal Democrat MP and former British Army officer, questioned why the UK has been reluctant to board the tankers independently, noting that the UK's Royal Marines are trained and equipped for such operations. \"Its not that hard to project force 12 miles off the Straits of Dover,\" he said. \"It's not that difficult to board a tanker.\" Russia also appears to have reacted to the UK's vow to take more assertive action against the shadow fleet. On 20 January the Times reported that a warship escorted sanctioned tanker General Skobelev through the Channel. And on 15 January, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Kremlin would view any detention of the tankers as a violation of international law which would be seen as \"harming Russian interests\". In a statement to BBC Verify, a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government. Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue to do so.\"\n\nTankers ignore UK warnings\n\nOther tankers which have been sanctioned by the US and EU, but not the UK, have also sailed through the Channel over the course of January. BBC Verify identified one vessel that took extreme measures to avoid detection and has been labelled by maritime experts as \"the darkest of the dark fleet\". The Arcusat - previously sanctioned by the US as the Tia, before changing its identity in 2024 - passed through the Channel on 8 January before being stopped by German federal police and turned around before it entered the country's waters. Last year, it obtained a new IMO number in a move that analysts said was almost unheard of. The unique code identifies ships and is supposed to be associated with a vessel for life, irrespective of changes of name or ownership. Despite mounting calls for tougher enforcement, shadow fleet vessels remain difficult to monitor. Sanctioned tankers will deploy several strategies to evade detection - including flying under false flags, switching off their tracking signals, and broadcasting false locations. \"Once vessels start doing these direct port calls within Russia, they're less afraid of compliance,\" Zhminko told BBC Verify. \"Because it is already sanctioned it is easier for her to be a part of the open shadow fleet - she can't do any mainstream market port calls because she is already sanctioned.\"\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the shadow fleet tankers move between $87bn-$100bn worth of oil per year. Vaibhav Raghunandan, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said that 68% of all Russian crude oil was carried on sanctioned tankers in December 2025. Mike Martin MP said that the revenue generated by the shadow fleet was helping to fund Russia's war in Ukraine and providing the Kremlin with an economic lifeline. He said the conflict would only come to an end \"when Russia's economy collapses\". \"A key lever we have to pull is knock out oil sales through the shadow fleet,\" Martin told BBC Verify. \"So I think it's massively important, it's irritating we didn't get on it much earlier.\" Additional reporting by Matt Murphy, Jack Fenwick and Joshua Cheetham.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:58:03 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23T11:31:59.256054"}

African health leaders said it was cancelled. At the heart of the controversy is the west African nation of Guinea-Bissau – one of the poorest countries in the world and the proposed site of a hotly debated US-funded study on vaccines.\n\nThe study on hepatitis B vaccination, to be led by Danish researchers, became a flashpoint after major changes to the US vaccination schedule and prompted questions about how research is conducted ethically in other countries.\n\nOn Thursday, Quinhin Nantote, a military doctor and the recently appointed minister of health in Guinea-Bissau, confirmed to journalists that the trial has been “cancelled or suspended” because the science was not well-reviewed. Guinea-Bissau experienced a coup in November, and top leaders were recently replaced.\n\nA team of research experts at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, at Nantote’s request, will travel to Guinea-Bissau to help officials review the study. Officials from Denmark and the US have also been invited to review the trial, Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa CDC, said at the press meeting.\n\nThe decision to halt the trial is not for international organizations or foreign countries to determine, Kaseya said.\n\n“It’s the sovereignty of the country,” he said. “I don’t know what will be this decision, but I will support the decision that the minister will make.”\n\nOfficials with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have called into question the credibility of the Africa CDC, after officials with the organization confirmed the study was cancelled.\n\n“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement on Wednesday. He said the Africa CDC was waging “a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts”. When asked by the Guardian, he offered no proof of either claim.\n\nAn HHS official also called the Africa CDC “a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly”, adding that the organization was “not a reliable source”.\n\nKaseya said he had spoken to senior HHS officials, who were unaware of the statement, and he pointed to the Africa CDC’s key role in responding to outbreaks with global implications.\n\n“It’s very important to fund research that Africans actually want,” said Abdulhammad Babatunde, a medical doctor and global health researcher in Nigeria. “Africans want to solve Africa’s problems, not satisfy the curiosity of the funders.”\n\nThe researchers would have given hepatitis B vaccines to 7,000 infants at birth and withheld the vaccines for another 7,000 infants until six weeks of age in order to study the overall health effects of giving the vaccines alongside other shots. Nearly one in five adults and about 11% of young children in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B – putting them at high risk of severe illness and death.\n\n“This is not acceptable,” said Babatunde of the study’s design. “To prevent things like the Tuskegee study and others, the control group has to get the standard of care, and the intervention group should get [potentially] better care.”\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends giving the hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns within 24 hours of birth. Infants in Guinea-Bissau currently receive the shot at six weeks of age, but the doses will roll out to all newborns in 2028 in order to close gaps in care standards. “The current reason why the vaccine is not achieving coverage in Guinea-Bissau is because there’s no funding, and the funding should try to promote the vaccine, not use children as lab rats,” Babatunde said.\n\nOfficials in an imbalanced power structure may be intimidated, he said. “It might be a very tough call for the officials in Guinea-Bissau, depending on what they stand to lose if they restrict the study. At this moment, it’s [time] for other African member states to come support Guinea-Bissau, to maintain their sovereignty and protect the children of Guinea-Bissau.”\n\nWhen deciding whether a revised version of the study will move forward, “the most important voice” is that of Guinea-Bissau’s ministry of health, which is responsible for protecting the health of all Bissau-Guineans, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global Health Institute. “So hearing from ministry officials today is hugely important.”\n\nThe confusion in Guinea-Bissau comes back to how the trial was given the green light, said Nantote, who spoke in Portuguese through a translator.\n\nAn early version of the study was approved by Guinea-Bissau’s six-person ethics committee, Comité Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa em Saúde (CNEPS), on 5 November, according to the Danish researchers. The researchers have since made updates that have not been approved by the committee.\n\nThe Guinea-Bissau ethics committee, CNEPS, initially approved the study, according to an individual who identified himself to the Guardian as the interim director of CNEPS. The study did not mention that infants would go unvaccinated, he said – but the ethical concern is that the vaccine would be withheld from some newborns at birth, when it is most needed. No further changes have been made to the design of the trial because it was “suspended” by the country’s ministry of health, he said.\n\n“We think that they did not meet and they did not address this issue adequately,” Nantote said of the ethics committee.\n\nThe Danish researchers did not appear to seek approval from ethics boards in Denmark or the US, though the Helsinki declaration requires approval from research ethics committees in both the sponsoring and host countries.\n\nThe HHS did not respond to the Guardian’s questions on ethical concerns and its characterization of the Africa CDC. The researchers did not respond to inquiries about the trial’s cancellation or questions about their research. The HHS, the researchers, and the University of Southern Denmark did not respond to inquiries about whether US or Danish ethical committees were consulted.\n\nNantote and Kaseya both highlighted the challenges to health in Guinea-Bissau. Less than a quarter of the country has access to basic services such as water and sanitation. Poverty and food insecurity are persistent. With limited access to healthcare, maternal mortality is high, and malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\n“The authorities of Guinea-Bissau, they know that,” Kaseya said. “They are doing their best to address that.”", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:00:14 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23T11:31:59.567770"}

The Kremlin confirmed Russian officials would attend the talks following a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and US envoys in Moscow. Russia described those talks as \"useful in every respect\", but said a long-term peace deal could not be reached until territorial issues had been resolved. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he regarded the Abu Dhabi talks as \"a step - hopefully towards ending the war\".\n\nPresent at the Thursday night meeting with Putin and two other Russian aides were three US representatives, including Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the talks were \"substantive, constructive and very frank\", but reiterated that any agreement for durable peace would not be possible without resolving territorial issues. \"Until this is achieved, Russia will continue to consistently pursue the objectives of the special military operation,\" he said. Ushakov added that Putin emphasised Russia was \"sincerely interested\" in a diplomatic solution. \"Without resolving the territorial issue according to the formula agreed upon in Anchorage, there is no hope of achieving a long-term settlement,\" he said, a reference to the summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska last year. Witkoff last year said that Russia had agreed to allow the US and Europe to give Ukraine \"robust\" security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal. After meeting with Trump in Davos, Zelensky also made clear that the future status of territory in eastern Ukraine remained an unsolved issue ahead of talks in Abu Dhabi. \"It's all about the land. This is the issue which is not solved yet,\" Zelensky told reporters in Davos, adding that \"the Russians have to be ready for compromises, not only Ukraine\". On Friday, he told journalists: \"The Donbas issue is key. It will be discussed as will be the modality of how the three sides see it.\" He added that he regards the Abu Dhabi talks as \"a step - hopefully towards ending the war - but different things can happen.\" The territorial sticking points include Russia's demand that Ukraine give up the 25% of the Donetsk region that Kyiv still controls.

Senior officials from all three nations are involved, but it is unclear whether they will be in the same room together at any point. And whilst the talks take a new format, the core differences remain the same. The stakes are high, but expectations are limited.\n\nDonald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal in Ukraine – the one he promised but hasn't yet delivered – and he said this week that the two sides would be \"stupid\" if they couldn't agree. But despite some intense shuttle diplomacy by his own envoys, they are hosting the first trilateral talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with some major issues still unresolved. Ukraine is engaging with the process because it wants peace more than anyone, but also because it needs to keep the US onside. It learned that lesson the hard way last year, when Donald Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing and military aid.\n\nNow, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his talks with Trump in Davos were \"really positive\" and he hopes for more air defence support against Russia's relentless attacks as a result. Often grim-faced after his encounters with the US leader, this time Zelensky seemed unusually upbeat. But he remains cautious on the outcome of talks in the United Arab Emirates. He's described the meetings, which may last two days, as \"a step\", but shied away from calling it a positive one. \"We have to wish it will push us a bit closer to peace,\" is how he put it. For a while, Zelensky has talked about being 90% of the way to producing a framework deal for peace, but the final 10% was always going to be the hardest - and Russia could still reject the whole thing. \"It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue that's not resolved yet,\" he explained, spelling out the biggest obstacle that he says still remains.\n\nRussia insists that Ukraine should hand over the big slice of the eastern Donbas region, which it has failed to win on the battlefield. Ukraine refuses. Politicians often talk about their red lines, but for this country the line in the Donbas is drawn with the blood of the soldiers who died defending it. Zelensky can't cross it. As I write this, the music from another soldier's funeral is drifting up from a church in the street. On my way back into Ukraine this time, we drove passed so many military graves in roadside cemeteries, all marked with flags. The other big issue up for discussion in the UAE is what the US would do, militarily, if Russia were to invade Ukraine again someday. That's what Ukraine calls its \"security guarantees\", and says are essential. Zelensky says the deal between the US and Ukraine is done, but we have no real details.

An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a \"war zone\" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition. A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world. But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen. Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan. \"There were women and men from seven to 70 years old,\" she said. \"On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency. First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot. \"I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.\"\n\nParnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters. \"I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets.\" Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire. Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire.\n\nPhone footage The building of the state broadcaster in Isfahan was set on fire\n\nOn Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called \"destructive elements\", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran \"very hard\" if authorities started killing people. Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest.

On Thursday, Trump said that US allies stayed \"a little off the front lines\" in the conflict and claimed he was not sure Nato \"would be there\" if the US needed it. Starmer said if he himself had \"mispoken in that way\", he would \"certainly apologise\". Trump's words sparked international outrage as the UK and other nations joined the US in Afghanistan after Nato's collective security clause was invoked following the 9/11 attacks. During the conflict, 457 British service personnel were killed.\n\n\"I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,\" Starmer said. \"There were many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries. \"I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.\"\n\nStarmer was reacting to an interview Trump gave to Fox News where he said: \"We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. \"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nReuters Starmer said he is not surprised Trump's comments have \"caused such hurt\"\n\nTrump's remarks drew condemnation from across the UK's political divide, with critics pointing to the number of UK deaths in Afghanistan and highlighting Trump's avoidance of military service in Vietnam. The only time Nato's mutual defence arrangement - Article 5 - has ever been invoked was after the terrorist attacks on America in September 2001.\n\nThe following month the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers had died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which saw 2,461 fatalities.\n\nWatch: Trump's comments 'extremely disrespectful' - British veteran\n\nMost of the 457 British troops who died serving in Afghanistan over a period of nearly 20 years were killed in Helmand - the scene of the heaviest fighting. Hundreds more suffered injuries and lost limbs - including Cpl Andy Reid who lost both his legs and his right arm after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. \"Not a day goes by when we're not in some kind of pain, physically or mentally reflecting on that conflict,\" he told BBC Breakfast. Reid recalled working with American soldiers during his time in Afghanistan, adding: \"If they were on the front line and I was stood next to them, clearly we were on the front line as well.\"\n\nGetty Former paratrooper Ben Parkinson has been regarded as the most severely injured British soldier to survive in Afghanistan\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered severe injuries when an Army Land Rover hit a mine near Musa Qala in 2006, said Trump's words were \"so insulting\" and hard to hear. The 41-year-old is currently recuperating after another operation, but Dernie told the BBC that Trump's comments showed \"a childish man trying to deflect from his own actions\".\n\nMother of injured veteran says Trump Afghan comments \"the rantings of a child\"\n\nDernie called on Starmer to \"stand up for his own armed forces\" and call out the US president. Her comments were put to the prime minister who replied: \"I've made my position clear, and what I say to Diane is, if I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologise and I'd apologise to her.\" Giving a second interview to the BBC moments after Starmer's statement, Dernie said the prime minister's words were strong enough - but said he should go further. \"His words were exactly what we wanted to hear, but we need those words to be addressed directly to the president,\" Dernie said. \"I appreciate what Starmer has said, but they need to be said to Donald Trump.\"\n\nThroughout Friday, the leaders of the main Westminster political parties gave their reaction to Trump's comments. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"I spoke to parents of young men who have lost their lives. It is a disgrace to denigrate their memory like that. \"There is too much careless talk from President Trump. He clearly doesn't know the history of what happened. We must not have these sorts of throwaway remarks.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the US president's remarks and said: \"Trump avoided military service five times. How dare he question their sacrifice.\" Trump received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Donald Trump is wrong. For 20 years our armed forces fought bravely alongside America's in Afghanistan.\"\n\nDuring his second term in office, Trump has repeatedly criticised Nato, often accusing its member states of not spending enough on defence. In the last few weeks, Trump has made comments about acquiring Greenland - a semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato ally Denmark. Trump's repeated remarks over ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional European allies have rattled the transatlantic treaty. On Friday - before Starmer called on the US president to apologise - the White House released a statement sticking by Trump's long-held view on Nato. The White House said: \"President Trump is right – America's contributions to Nato dwarf that of other countries, and his success in delivering a 5% spending pledge from Nato allies is helping Europe take greater responsibility for its own defense. \"The United States is the only Nato partner who can protect Greenland, and the president is advancing Nato interests in doing so.\" The White House is yet to comment on Starmer's call for an apology.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:42:53 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23T17:51:25.447061"}

Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile. Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all. America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.\n\nThe Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so. Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 19:02:50 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-23T19:36:33.743724"}

At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.\n\nThe Pentagon also says it will offer \"more limited\" support to US allies.\n\nThe document, published once every four years, instead says that the security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere is the department's chief concern, adding that Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans.\n\nChina is no longer the top security priority for the US, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.\n\nBy comparison, the 2022 National Defense Strategy named the \"multi-domain threat\" posed by China as its top defence priority.

The goal \"is not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them\", the document says.\n\nUnlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".\n\nLate last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.\n\nThe strategy also calls for greater \"burden-sharing\" from US allies, saying that partners have been \"content\" to let Washington \"subsidize their defense\".\n\nThough, it denies this demonstrates a move towards \"isolationism\".\n\n\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says, adding that it does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"\n\nInstead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\".\n\nRussia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".\n\nThe strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds.\n\nIn a speech made at the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together.\n\n\"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting.\n\nThat came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\".", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sat, 24 Jan 2026 05:21:06 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-24T05:48:36.859358"}

Earlier this week Trump angered US allies by downplaying the role of Nato troops in the war and doubted whether the military alliance would be there for the US \"if we ever needed them\". Trump's words drew condemnation from international allies, while Sir Keir Starmer called them \"insulting and frankly appalling\". The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".\n\nTrump was criticised for remarks he made during an interview with Fox News on Thursday in which the president said of Nato troops: \"We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. \"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\" That triggered a huge backlash from the families of soldiers who served in Afghanistan, as well as veterans and politicians from across the Westminster and international spectrum who called for Trump to apologise. Prince Harry said the sacrifices of troops needed to be respected as he pointed out Nato's collective security clause had been invoked once - following the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn October 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks the previous month. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which suffered 2,461 fatalities. On Saturday, Downing Street said the prime minister and US president spoke about the UK's involvement alongside US and Nato forces in the conflict. A spokesperson said: \"The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home. We must never forget their sacrifice\".\n\nShortly after the conversation, Trump posted fresh comments on his Truth Social platform - appearing to step back from his critical comments but stopping short of directly apologising for the words he used in Thursday's interview. He wrote: \"The great and very brave soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America. \"In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. \"It's a bond too strong to ever be broken. The UK military, with tremendous heart and soul, is second to none (except for the USA). We love you all, and always will!\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she was pleased Trump had acknowledged the UK's role in fighting alongside the US and Nato allies in Afghanistan. \"It should never have been questioned in the first place,\" she said.\n\nWatch: Trump's comments 'extremely disrespectful' - British veteran\n\nOn Friday, the Duke of Sussex released a statement in which he praised the contributions of Nato troops who were in Afghanistan. \"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" the prince said. \"In 2001, Nato invoked Article 5 for the first - and only - time in history. It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call. \"Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. \"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace.\"\n\nMost of the 457 British troops who died serving in Afghanistan over a period of nearly 20 years were killed in Helmand - the scene of the heaviest fighting. Hundreds more suffered injuries and lost limbs - including Cpl Andy Reid who lost both his legs and his right arm after stepping on an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. \"Not a day goes by when we're not in some kind of pain, physically or mentally reflecting on that conflict,\" he told BBC Breakfast on Friday.

Local officials identified the man as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen who lived in Minneapolis and worked as a nurse. Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man in the lead up to the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. \"Please get the truth out about our son,\" they added.\n\nThe incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. Here is what we know so far.\n\nWhat happened in the moments before the shooting?\n\nThe shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT). Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a \"9mm semi-automatic\" handgun. Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he \"violently resisted\". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then \"fired defensive shots\". Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent. The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible. Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him. One agent can be seen striking at his head. Another officer, who appears to approach the scuffle with empty hands, pulls back with what appears to be a gun in his hand. As he moves away toward a vehicle, a split second later another agent standing beside him opens fire. The agents jump back from the man lying on the ground and the firing continues. A total of 10 gunshots are heard.\n\nWhat do we know about the gun?\n\nUS Department of Homeland Security DHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they say belonged the man who was shot\n\nAfter the shooting, DHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they said belonged to Pretti. The agency also said he had two magazines of ammunition and no ID. Bovino told reporters it looked like a \"situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\". He did not provide any further evidence. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference that Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. His only previous interactions with law enforcement, as far as police are aware, were related to parking tickets. In a sign of the tensions between federal and local authorities, the police chief also said the DHS had not provided his team with \"any specific details\" about the deadly incident itself. Later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun. She said: \"Individuals showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. \"They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, said he understood the risk of people trying to bear witness and document the actions of federal agents. \"Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something.

For decades, the rich, warm tones of Mark Tully were familiar to BBC audiences in Britain and around the world - a much-admired foreign correspondent and respected reporter and commentator on India. He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple. In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting \"Death to Mark Tully\". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid. How the Babri mosque destruction shaped India Will English kill off India's languages? The demolition provoked the worst communal violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the \"gravest setback\" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947. India was where Tully was born - in what was then Calcutta in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations. He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: \"that's the servants' language, not yours,\" he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always \"Tully sahib\". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists.\n\nTully, seen here with members of India's armed forces, arrived in India as an administrative assistant at the BBC in 1965\n\nThroughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life. Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Tully came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts. He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through. Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's \"really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish,\" he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. \"... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism.\"\n\nGetty Images Tully's was a familiar voice for BBC listeners in the UK and around the world\n\nTully was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie. He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by \"fear\". It marked a parting of the ways. Tully resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student.\n\nGetty Images Tully stayed on in Delhi after he left the BBC", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:59:16 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-25T11:54:53.900692"}

Many popular parties are banned from standing and voting has not been possible in large areas of the country because of a five-year-long civil war. The dominant party backed by the ruling military junta is expected to win a landslide victory. The current regime has rejected international criticism of the election, maintaining that it is free and fair.\n\nAround one-fifth of the country's 330 townships, including the cities of Yangon and Mandalay, voted in the last stage. Six parties, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), fielded candidates nationwide, while another 51 parties and independent candidates decided to contest state and regional levels. Two previous rounds were held on 28 December and 11 January - giving overwhelming victories to the USDP. The party won only 6% of parliamentary seats in the last free election in 2020.\n\nA BBC team visited several polling stations in Shan state and described a climate of fear\n\nAs in previous rounds of this strange, month-long election, voting was orderly and peaceful at the polling station in Nyaungshwe, Shan State, which a BBC team observed. Set in a large school, shaded by huge rain trees, there were ample volunteers an officials to guide voters where to go, and how to make their choice using the new, locally-made electronic voting machines. You could be forgiven for believing this was a normal democratic exercise, not the sham its critics say it is. However polling day was preceded by a campaigning period marked by fear, intimidation and a pervasive sense that little will change after the inevitable victory by the USDP. Everywhere the BBC team travelled in southern Shan State, we were followed and closely monitored by dozens of police and military officials, always polite but very persistent. It proved nearly impossible to get people to say anything about the vote, so nervous were they of possible repercussions. The next steps after final results are announced are laid down in the military-drafted constitution. Parliament will meet within the next two months to choose a new president, and everyone expects that to be the coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing. It will be the same regime with civilian clothes. But he will then have to relinquish his command of the armed forces. His replacement is certain to be a loyalist, but his hold over the ranks of the military will inevitably be less secure, and it is no secret that many other senior officers do not believe he has made a good job of leading the country. With many more voices in politics, there is the possibility of wider debate inside government over which direction Myanmar should now take, and the possibility - distant for now - of the first steps towards ending the civil war.\n\nEPA Junta leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing is expected to be appointed president after the election", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:05:23 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-25T13:36:42.451538"}

The Grinch had been travelling through the Mediterranean Sea from the Russian Arctic port of Murmansk. It is now moored, under guard, at a southern French port near Marseille.

Teams from Brazil, South Africa and the UK have been helping with life-saving rescue operations. \"For me, this is the first time I have experienced a calamity of this magnitude. Elders say a similar disaster took place in the 1990s,\" 24-year-old mechanic Tomaz Antonio Mlau says.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock Many areas of south and central Mozambique are under water after two weeks of continuous downpours\n\nMlau and his family, who live near Marracuene - a town 30km (19 miles) north of the capital, Maputo - woke up to find their house inundated after the Inkomati River burst its banks. \"When a rescue boat came a few hours afterwards, we did not hesitate to board it and come to safety in Marracuene town,\" he said, adding they had to abandon all their belongings and only managed to bring a change of clothes. Mlau, his wife and two children have found refuge at one of six centres - schools and churches - that are so far sheltering about 4,000 people.\n\nMany of those gathered at Gwazamutini Secondary School are farmers from the low-lying areas with livestock and rice fields. \"We lost everything in the floodwaters, including houses, TV sets, fridges, clothing and livestock - cattle, goats and pigs. Our farms are under water. I am a farmer. I grow quality rice,\" 67-year-old Francisco Fernando Chivindzi told me. His home is in Hobjana, one of several flooded neighbourhoods between the left bank of the Incomati River and the coastal tourism resort of Macaneta. Marracuene town is on the river's right bank.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock More than 650,000 people have been affected by the rising water\n\n\"The floodwaters reached heights we weren't expecting.

That's a challenge. We reckon that more than 10,000 people are affected in Marracuene as a whole,\" he told me. At least 642,122 people have been affected since 7 January by flooding - particularly in southern and central regions, with 12 deaths recorded so far, according to provisional data from the National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction.\n\nJose Tembe/BBC The worry is that Inkomati River will be deluged with more waters released from a dam in South Africa\n\nIn total 125 people have died in Mozambique since the rainy season began in October. Mayor Sidat fears the situation is likely to get worse because of heavy rain in neighbouring South Africa, the source of the Inkomati River. \"We are worried about discharges of a South African dam on the Inkomati River.

The suspension is already leading to shortages and price hikes, including of basic foodstuffs, coconut and fuel - even as far away as the north-western city of Tete, more than 1,500km from Maputo.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock Many of those rescued have only only been able to bring a small bag of belongings with them\n\nFor those at shelters in Marracuene, food is also a challenge. \"There isn't yet enough food to eat,\" said Aninha Vicente Mivinga, whose two children are aged two and five. \"On the first day this Friday, there was almost nothing to eat. It was painful to see children sleeping without anything to eat, except biscuits. Today things improved,\" she said.\n\nMivinga, who is a police officer and farms in her spare time, described how she was at work in Marracuene town when the floods hit at her home in Hobjana. The 32-year-old had taken the precaution of taking her children to stay with family members who lived on higher ground because of the continuous rain, but even they were affected by the rising waters. \"To learn that my children and other members of the family were on floodwaters and at risk of dying was horrific. I was devastated and completely shaken,\" the officer said. \"Eventually my relatives were brought to safety.\n\nReuters Some people are not sure whether to return to their homes when the waters subside\n\n\"It is the first time since I was born that we've been affected by flooding of this dimension.\" Mivinga said that students were meant to resume classes soon - and she would like the authorities to find permanent alternative accommodation for them.

If only the authorities could give us another place on safer ground. We would go back to the risky area only for farming purposes but live on safer ground,\" the police officer said. Education Minister Samaria Tovela has already hinted that the cabinet is to consider rescheduling the start of the 2026 academic year, originally planned to begin next week, \"to allow flood victims to continue using them as accommodation centres, especially in the provinces of Maputo and Gaza, the most affected at the moment\".\n\nEPA/Shutterstock Areas of the capital, Maputo, are also under water\n\nChivindzi, who is not sure that the floodwaters will recede before schools resume, is determined to return home. \"We'll restart life from scratch,\" the farmer says.

The data provided to the BBC World Service and French investigative outlet, Disclose, reveals that Russia is using Interpol's wanted lists to request the arrest of people such as political opponents, businessmen and journalists, claiming that they have committed crimes. Analysis of data also suggests that over the past decade, Interpol's own independent complaints unit has received more complaints about Russia than anyone else - three times more than the next highest country, Turkey. In addition, it indicates complaints against Moscow's requests have led to more cases being overturned than for any other country. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Interpol introduced extra checks on Moscow's activity \"to prevent any potential misuse of Interpol's channels in relation to the targeting of individuals within or beyond the conflict in Ukraine\". But the leaked documents suggest these did not prevent Russia abusing the system and the whistleblower told us some stricter measures were quietly dropped in 2025.\n\nOLIVIER CHASSIGNOLE/AFP via Getty Images Interpol says it has systems in place to avoid misuse and these have been strengthened in recent years\n\nIn response, Interpol says that every year, thousands of the world's most serious criminals are arrested thanks to its operations and that it has a number of systems to avoid misuse which have been strengthened over the last few years. It also says it is aware of the potential impact requests for arrest can have on individuals. \"When you're hit with a red notice, your life changes completely,\" says Igor Pestrikov, a Russian businessman, whose name appears in the leaked files. Interpol is not a global police force itself, but helps police across the world to co-operate. A red notice is an alert to all of its 196 member countries, asking them to locate and arrest a person. A red diffusion is a similar request but is only sent to individual countries. Pestrikov found he was named in a red diffusion after he fled Russia in June 2022 - four months after the invasion of Ukraine - and applied for asylum in France. He felt he had two options: \"Go to the police and say, 'I'm in the Interpol system,'\" and risk arrest or lie low. This may mean \"you can't rent an apartment, your bank accounts get blocked\", which is what happened to him, he says. \"It's constant nerves, all the time,\" he adds, explaining he was always looking over his shoulder. For safety, his daughter and her mother moved to another country. The police can \"break into your house at any time… that's why you're like a cornered rat\", he says. \"It's the stress, the nerves, the pressure, the lawlessness inflicted on you,\" that breaks families apart, he adds.\n\nPestrikov had been a major shareholder in large metals companies in Russia that were privatised in the 1990s, most notably Solikamsk Magnesium Plant. In the months leading up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he says government ministers pressured him to stop selling his products abroad and only supply the Russian market. He believed this would mean his products could be used to make components for military hardware, such as fighter jets and tanks. He says it wasn't just that he was against \"having to sell much cheaper and to whoever the ministries told me to\" but that \"it was a moral issue as well... no-one wanted to get involved even indirectly in the production of something used to kill people\". Pestrikov believes his refusal to comply and the fact his wife at the time was Ukrainian led to his companies being nationalised and to Russia investigating him for financial crimes. After he fled to France, he was worried that the Kremlin might try to target him there, so he contacted Interpol and was told about the red diffusion request, which had passed the agency's checks. Pestrikov decided to challenge it through Interpol's internal, independent watchdog, the Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), arguing that Russia's request was politically motivated. Interpol's constitution expressly states that the organisation cannot be used \"to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character\".\n\nARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images Pestrikov fled Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began - one of the first cities to be attacked was Chuguiv in eastern Ukraine\n\nAfter Pestrikov had spent almost two years on the wanted list, the CCF ruled that his case was predominantly political. He showed us CCF documents that said the information Russia had provided was \"generic and formulaic\" and there had been an \"inadequate explanation\" of the alleged crime. Interpol cancelled the request for Pestrikov's detention. Interpol only releases very basic data about illegitimate requests for arrests and since 2018 has not revealed which countries are the subject of complaints and inquiries. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the scale of the problem, but for the first time, the leaked documents reveal a much fuller picture. One batch of files shared with the BBC contains a list of complaints sent to the CCF. The data is not complete, but it covers a broad range of countries, and where the nation requesting an arrest is listed, there are more complaints about Russia than anywhere else - this has been the case for the past 11 years. The files also show that in the past decade, at least 700 people who were wanted by Russia complained to the CCF, and at least 400 of them had their red notices or diffusions overturned - that is more than for any other country, according to the data we received.\n\nThe files show Russia attempted to use Interpol's messaging system to get information about journalist Armen Aramyan after he left the country\n\n\"Historically it has been Russia who is one of the main perpetrators of abusive red notices,\" says British barrister Ben Keith, who has represented many clients wishing to have their names removed from Interpol's wanted lists. He thinks Interpol has a particular problem with Russia and that the agency's attempts to prevent abuse have not been successful. He says that he has \"a steady flow of clients who are subject to Russian red notices who are either politically connected, or often pro-Ukraine, or alternatively as a result of corporate raiding\". International lawyer Yuriy Nemets, who specialises in Interpol matters and extradition, agrees that Interpol's extra scrutiny of Russia's requests for arrests, introduced after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has not proved effective. He says he is aware of a number of cases in which Russians opposed to the war \"have been targeted for speaking out against what's going on and were charged with financial… or other ordinary crimes and put into the database based on that\". \"It's not hard to game the system,\" he adds. As well as information on notices and complaints, the Interpol insider also provided the BBC with thousands of messages sent between individual countries via Interpol's messaging system, revealing another, less formal route to trace people abroad. One message from Moscow to law enforcement agents in Abu Dhabi explained how Interpol had denied a request for a red notice, but that it still wanted help in tracing the subject's whereabouts. This goes against Interpol advice that members should not use its channels in this way. The leak also contains a message about Armen Aramyan, a journalist who had fled Russia after he was convicted of \"engaging minors in dangerous activities\" for reporting on student protests that supported the opposition leader Alexei Navalny in January 2021.\n\nAleksey Fokin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Riot police were deployed when thousands of people across Russia protested against the arrest of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in suspicious circumstances in prison in 2024\n\nAramyan went to Armenia and then on to Germany. The message from Russia to law enforcement entities in both countries sidestepped the more formal red notice and red diffusion process, and asked for \"any useful information\" about Aramyan as well as his whereabouts. The message was sent in February 2023, during the time Russia was under restrictive measures and its messages were being checked before being sent. We can't say for sure whether the message was delivered, but based on the source of the data, the whistleblower believes that it was. When the BBC showed Aramyan a copy of the message, he said he was shocked but not surprised. \"I don't think they expected that Germany [would] send them my address, my phone number, and extradite me, but if they could at least get some sort of tiny bits of information it would still be valuable for them.\" The leak contains other messages in which a foreign law enforcement agency responds to Moscow's request for information. It sent details about the movements of an ally of Navalny, Lyubov Sobol, and high-profile defector Gleb Karakulov. The exchange relating to Karakulov happened after Interpol announced its additional vetting of Moscow.\n\nSputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Pool via REUTERS One report says Russia requested red diffusions on ICC judges - this came after the court issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, over Ukraine", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:15:03 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-26T02:37:05.984952"}

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said America was at an \"inflection point\" and repeated calls for US President Donald Trump to remove federal immigration agents from the city. The US president meanwhile called for the governor to \"turn over all Criminal Illegal Aliens\" incarcerated in state prisons for deportation. Meanwhile Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told the BBC that state officers were blocked from accessing the scene of the shooting by federal agents, despite securing a search warrant.\n\nHe added that all levels of law enforcement in Minnesota have been working with federal law enforcement \"for several years\", and that the unfolding situation in Minnesota was hampering agencies' ability to continue such investigations. US Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino on Saturday accused O'Hara and Frey of trying to derail federal law enforcement operations.\n\nTrump signaled in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Sunday that he might be willing to eventually withdraw ICE agents from the Minneapolis area, but did not provide a time frame. He told the outlet: \"At some point we will leave. We've done, they've done a phenomenal job.\" In the interview, the president added that his administration was \"reviewing everything\" about Pretti's death and said that it \"will come out with a determination\". Lawmakers continue to be divided over the shooting of Pretti, as well as his second Amendment right to bear arms. US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun. Local authorities say the gun was legally registered, he was not brandishing it, and he was shot after the gun was removed. The Trump administration has described Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist\". Pretti's family issued a statement in response to the comment saying \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\". His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record. \"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" his family said in the statement.\n\nWatch: 'Horrifying too so many people' protesters express anger and shock over ICE killing\n\nBacklash against the Trump administration's crackdown is growing, including from within the Republican party. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt told CNN that people were watching fellow Americans being shot on television and that \"federal tactics and accountability\" had become a growing concern for voters. Asked whether ICE should be removed from Minnesota, Stitt said that the president needed to answer that question, but he was \"getting bad advice right now\". Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy said the Minneapolis shooting was \"incredibly disturbing\" and \"the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\" Democrats have responded by threatening to block a key government financing package if it contains funds for the Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, raising the prospect of another government shutdown. Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but several polls suggest about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally. Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants. One conducted by Politico shortly after Renee Good's death this month suggested about half of Americans felt the mass deportation campaign was too aggressive. Meanwhile on Sunday evening Trump demanded in a post on Truth Social that Walz and Frey, as well as \"EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States\" must \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence\". He listed a series of requests that he said were \"rooted in common sense\", most notably petitioning US Congress to end sanctuary cities, which he alleged were the cause of \"all these problems\". The term 'sanctuary city' is commonly used to describe places in the US that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities. Trump's posts followed remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, where she condemned Walz as wanting chaos, and encouraging \"left-wing agitators to stalk and record federal officers in the middle of lawful operations\".\n\nGetty Images 25 January, 2026: A demonstration against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Chicago\n\nSunday saw hundreds of protesters in Minneapolis brave freezing conditions to protest the shooting, as armed and masked agents used tear gas and stun grenades against them. Protests have spread to other US cities, with people seen holding signs saying \"Justice for Alex\" and \"abolish ICE\" in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The chief executives of more than 60 Minnesota-based businesses, including 3M, Best Buy, Target, and UnitedHealth Group have also signed an open letter calling for \"an immediate de-escalation of tensions\" and for local and federal officials \"to work together to find real solutions\".\n\nGetty Images\n\nFederal agents shot and killed Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, and videos have since emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and Pretti just before the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. What we know about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis\n\nWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?\n\nIf you are in Minneapolis, please share your story O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told the BBC that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations. It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit. The National Rifle Association (NRA) - which is typically aligned with Trump - has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a \"full investigation\" into the killing of Pretti. In a statement, it said: \"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens.\" Bovino said earlier that at the time of the shooting, ICE agents were seeking Jose Huerta Chuma during a \"targeted\" operation, and that Chuma's criminal history includes domestic assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and disorderly conduct. The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) has since rebutted those claims, and said that Huerta had never been in Minnesota DOC custody and public records reflected only misdemeanor-level traffic offenses from more than a decade ago.\n\nUnpicking the second Minneapolis shooting frame by frame", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:30:26 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-26T05:49:54.484887"}

The 140-year-old building sits just blocks away from where Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot dead by federal immigration agents during a confrontation on Saturday morning. In the wake of the shooting, which marked the second time in less than a month that a US citizen has been killed by agents in the city, the church has become what locals describe as a haven from the unrest and uncertainty outside. There was no service here on Sunday. Instead volunteers and church staff, such as Ann Hotz, who works at the church's daycare centre, handed out coffee, snacks and hand warmers to those who stopped by. Some were on their way to lay flowers at a nearby memorial for Pretti, while others visited on their way home from protests against the weeks-long federal immigration enforcement operation in the city. \"Yesterday, I fell apart,\" Hotz told the BBC as she helped move cases of water outside. \"Today I'm here to stand with my community and help our neighbours as they remember Alex and mourn him.\" \"But I do have to say, the helpers are getting really tired,\" she added. \"This is exhausting, and so we need there to be a change.\"\n\n\"This is exhausting, and so we need there to be a change,\" Ann Hotz said\n\n\"This is what America is now,\" Dean Caldwell-Tautges, the church administrator, said of the actions of federal immigration agents in his hometown in recent weeks. Caldwell-Tautges, who was handing out whistles which have been used to alert people to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, said supporting the community in this way was \"the Christian thing to do\". The city of Minneapolis now finds itself at the forefront of the national immigration debate for the second time this month. Renee Nicole Good, another Minnesota resident, was shot and killed by an ICE agent on 7 January. Videos of both shootings quickly spread on social media. They prompted angry protests from those who want to see an end to an immigration enforcement operation that has seen thousands of agents deployed to the city's streets.\n\nGetty Images Several memorials to Alex Pretti have been built since his death on Saturday\n\nPresident Trump ordered the agents to the Democrat-held state in December, pledging a massive deportation of undocumented migrants. A crackdown on illegal immigration was central to his successful re-election campaign and is backed by many around the country. The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety efffort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too. On Sunday, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump praised the agents' work but suggested the operation would eventually end, although he did not specify when. \"At some point we will leave,\" Trump said. \"They've done a phenomenal job.\" The state's Governor Tim Walz has urged the president to remove the agents immediately. \"We believe that Trump needs to pull his 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another American in the street,\" he said on Sunday. Other state and local officials have echoed Walz's view. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened.\n\nUnpicking the second Minneapolis shooting frame by frame\n\nOver the course of the weekend, multiple vigils were held in the city as residents sought to remember and celebrate Pretti's life. At the site where he was killed in south Minneapolis, close to the Calvary Baptist Church, mourners gathered at all hours to lay flowers and light candles in his honour. One sign, drawn with red paint and directed at federal agents, read \"stop killing us\". Lifelong Minneapolis resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those gathered on Sunday afternoon to protest against ICE and pay her respects to Pretti. \"I'm tired of protesting,\" she said. \"We can't comprehend how this is happening. Why are we letting this happen?\" \"We're on tenterhooks,\" she added. \"We don't know what's going to happen next.\"\n\n\"I don't understand how they can come in and just start snatching people,\" Felix Johnson said", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:50:14 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-26T05:49:54.697785"}

Schools and roads across the country have been closed and flights have been cancelled as \"life threatening\" conditions stretched from Texas to New England, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). At least two people died of hypothermia in Louisiana, and other deaths linked to the storm have been reported in Texas, Tennessee and Kansas. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 800,000 households had lost power, according to poweroutage.us. Meanwhile, more than 11,000 flights were cancelled, FlightAware reported.\n\nWidespread heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain, which is a dangerous phenomenon where cooled rain droplets freeze instantly on surfaces, could last for days, and the storm could affect around 180 million Americans - more than half the population. \"The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won't be going away anytime soon, and that's going to hinder any recovery efforts,\" Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told the BBC's US media partner CBS News. Louisiana's Department of Health confirmed on Sunday that two men had died of hypothermia. The mayor of Austin, Texas, said there had been an \"exposure-related\" death. Officials in Kansas said a woman, whose body was found on Sunday afternoon covered in snow, \"may have succumbed to hypothermia\". Weather-related deaths of three people have also been reported in Tennessee. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani wrote in a post on X that at least five people in the city had died on Saturday but added their cause of death was yet to be determined.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on Sunday that the state was seeing more ice and less snow than was originally predicted. \"That is not good news for Kentucky,\" he said. Weather experts have warned that one of the biggest dangers of the storm is ice, which has the potential to damage trees, down power lines and make roads unsafe. In Virginia and Kentucky, authorities have responded to hundreds of crashes on roads. Canadians have also been hit with heavy snow and hundreds of cancelled flights.

Comments from the NRA come after a border agent fatally shot Pretti - registered nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital - in Minneapolis on Saturday. State and federal officials have given starkly different accounts. The Trump administration has said Pretti carried a gun and posed a danger to officers - while no available video shows Pretti holding a gun. The NRA labelled a suggestion by a federal prosecutor that people who carry guns risk being lawfully shot by officers as \"dangerous and wrong\".\n\n\"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens,\" the NRA said in a statement. The NRA - which is typically aligned with Donald Trump - was reacting to comments from First Assistant US Attorney for the Central District of California on Saturday night. Bill Essayli wrote on social media: \"If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. Don't do it!\" In a separate social-media post, the NRA said: \"As there is with any officer-involved shooting, there will be a robust and comprehensive investigation that takes place to determine if the use of force was justified. \"As we await these facts and gain a clearer understanding, we urge the political voices to lower the temperature to ensure their constituents and law enforcement officers stay safe.\"\n\nEssayli's comments have drawn criticism from other gun advocacy groups, as well as politicians from across the spectrum. Gun Owners of America said in a statement: \"The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting - a right the federal government must not infringe upon.\" Republican Thomas Massie said: \"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government.\" In a follow-up social media post, Essayli accused critics of taking his comments out of context. \"I never said it's legally justified to shoot law-abiding concealed carriers,\" he said on X. \"My comment addressed agitators approaching law enforcement with a gun and refusing to disarm.\"\n\nFor the second time this month, federal agents have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis linked to a crackdown on illegal immigration by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

The Rafah crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. It was meant to have reopened during the first stage of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which began in October. However, the Israeli government has made that conditional on Hamas making every effort to return the body of the last hostage, police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili.

Emotions ran high at the Ueno zoo in Tokyo as people stood in line – some for as long as three-and-a-half hours – to see twin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei one last time. This comes at a very tense moment in relations between Tokyo and Beijing. Ties have sharply deteriorated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Tokyo would get involved militarily if China attacked Taiwan. The twins' departure will leave Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972, the year the two countries normalised diplomatic ties.\n\nThe People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors since it was founded in 1949. But China retains ownership of all pandas it loans to foreign countries, including cubs born abroad. In return, host countries pay an annual fee of about $1m (£790,000) per pair of pandas. According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, some 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots available for one last look at the zoo's beloved pandas. \"I have been bringing my son here since he was a baby, so I hope it becomes a good memory for him. I'm glad we could come today to remember them,\" Ai Shirakawa told the BBC.\n\nAi Shirakawa (left) says she has been bringing her son to see the pandas since he was born\n\nAnother woman recalled witnessing the pandas' growth journey. \"Witnessing their growth, especially since they were so small, has been such a joy,\" she said. Some visitors were pictured sobbing as they bade the bears goodbye. Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were born in 2021 at the Ueno zoo to their mother Shin Shin and their father Ri Ri, both of whom were on loan to Japan for breeding research. More recently, China's panda loans have coincided with major trade agreements. In 2011, the loan of two pandas to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China. Many pandas have been returned to China in recent years – a loan agreement typically lasts 10 years although extensions are common. However, the prospects of a new panda loan to Japan have remained uncertain amid the escalating row. Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan angered Beijing which views the self-governed island as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it. Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile actions and rhetoric towards each other.

Wine, who is in hiding, alleged on Saturday that his wife was held at gunpoint by military officers who assaulted her, taking away documents and electronic items. He said the house continued to be surrounded by the military. Speaking from hospital, Barbara Kyagulanyi said the officers had demanded to know Wine's whereabouts and had assaulted her when she refused. It comes after the recent landslide victory of long-serving leader, and Kainerugaba's father, President Yoweri Museveni. Wine rejected the results citing fraud.\n\nOn Monday, the general posted on X that \"my soldiers did not beat up Barbie [Bobi Wine's] wife\". \"First of all, we do not beat up women. They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her,\" he said. Since Museveni was announced the winner of the 15 January election, the military chief has demanded Wine's surrender and has issued death threats against him. Wine said on Monday that Kainerugaba was still looking for him \"and issuing threats to harm me\" and thanked the people for continuing to keep him safe. \"My wife is still recovering from the trauma of an overnight raid and assault... My home is still surrounded by the military,\" he added in a post on X. From her hospital bed, Barbara Kyagulanyi had described how dozens of men had broken into her house, some in military uniform, harassing and assaulting her. She said one of the men \"hit me on the face and tore my lip\". She said the officer had lifted her from behind by the waistband of her trousers while another choked her as she hung mid-air. She said the first officer pulled off her blouse, leaving her partially naked, though it was later given back. She said the officer also pulled her hair and \"hit me on the face and tore my lip\". Barbara Kyagulanyi said she passed out after the ordeal. According to Wine, she was taken to hospital \"with both physical and psychological trauma\".\n\nSince the election, the opposition has alleged that its supporters have been targeted by the security forces. Kainerugaba said on Friday that security officers had killed 30 supporters of the opposition National Unity Party (NUP) led by Wine and detained 2,000 others. Lawmaker Muwanga Kivumbi, who is a close Wine ally, was arrested for his alleged role in election-related violence last week, which the party denied. The Uganda Law Society denounced the \"ongoing wave of detentions, torture and enforced disappearance\" of opposition leaders and supporters\". \"No-one should be subjected to violence by security forces under the pretext of national security,\" the society said on Sunday.

Macron said he had asked the government of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to use a fast-track procedure to get the legislation on the books by September.\n\nWithout resort to the fast-track (which permits a single reading as opposed to two in each of the two houses), the law would have little chance of getting past the legislative backlog created by Lecornu's difficulties in passing a budget.\n\nThe bill has already had to be redrafted to take account of questions raised by the Council of State, the body which previews draft legislation to ensure it conforms with French and European law.\n\nA 2023 law which proposed a similar ban on social media for young teenagers proved inoperable after courts decided it broke European law.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:14:43 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-26T14:36:08.249445"}

The rivers have connected with all areas where there is water,” Bongece was quoted as saying by local media last week. One person was killed by a crocodile in Maputo, in the town of Moamba, and two in neighbouring Gaza province, officials said.\n\nSouthern Africa has been hit by increasingly extreme weather in recent years as the climate crisis has worsened, veering between record-breaking droughts, cyclones and extreme rainfall.\n\nThe death toll in Mozambique is expected to rise. Officials said the flooding was the worst in the country since 2000, when about 700 people were killed. Almost 400,000 people have been displaced, with many rescued by helicopter from trees and rooftops.\n\nView image in fullscreen Flood waters cover the Chibuto-Chaimite road in Gaza province, Mozambique.

So for sure, soon we will have cases of cholera,” said Gaspar Sitefane, the director of WaterAid Mozambique.\n\nFood security is also a concern, with about 60,000 hectares of farmland lost to the floods and more than 58,000 livestock killed, according to Mozambique’s disaster agency.\n\nView image in fullscreen People who have lost their homes sit outside a church in the Manhica district of Maputo, Mozambique.

Sixteen officers were arrested last October after what were described as \"acts of indiscipline and breaches of service regulations\". At the time the military dismissed rumours of an attempted coup, but following an investigation, the authorities have acknowledged that some of the 16 will go before a military judicial panel. Nigeria has a complex history of military involvement in politics, with multiple coups between 1966 and 1993, which has made allegations of coup‑plotting highly sensitive.\n\nIt is not clear how many of the 16 will go on trial, but the military authorities said the process would ensure accountability and uphold \"the principles of fairness and due process\". A statement added that trying to unseat the elected government was \"inconsistent with the ethics, values and professional standards\" of the military. In recent years, concerns over instability, insecurity and public frustration have occasionally prompted rumours about dissent within the ranks - rumours the military has repeatedly dismissed. Nigeria has experienced a period of unbroken civilian rule since 1999. The armed forces have consistently stressed their loyalty to civilian authority, often issuing public statements reaffirming their commitment to democracy. This latest development comes at a time when the West African region has experienced a resurgence of coups. Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea have all seen their governments toppled by soldiers since the beginning of the decade. However, Guinea recently returned to a democratic rule with the junta leader, Mamadi Doumbouya elected president. These events have created heightened vigilance among governments in the region, including Nigeria, which has traditionally positioned itself as a stabilising force within the regional grouping Ecowas. Within Nigeria, the military continues to face intense operational pressures - from fighting militant jihadist groups in the north-east to tackling criminals and communal violence across the north‑west and central states. Analysts say such pressures, combined with resource constraints and public scrutiny, have put the spotlight on discipline within the armed forces.\n\nGetty Images/BBC", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:07:08 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-26T20:35:58.866150"}

As Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino and some immigration agents depart, \"border tsar\" Tom Homan will begin leading on-the-ground efforts in the Minnesota city after the shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday escalated tensions. The decision by President Donald Trump may indicate the administration's interest in walking back more aggressive federal action in his nationwide immigration crackdown. Despite the announcement, online tracking of immigration raids shows the administration's efforts have still continued.\n\nBovino was the face of the operation when Pretti - an observer seen filming agents - got into a confrontation that led to him being shot numerous times on a street in Minneapolis. The border control commander inflamed the situation on the ground in the aftermath of the shooting, claiming that Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. Before the shooting, Bovino was key to the Trump administration's hard-line approach to immigration enforcement in several cities, active on social media and regularly filming raids and posting promotional videos showing his agents' action. Homan, who will report directly to the president, advocates for Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement. But he also has experience in the role - Homan worked with immigration and deportations during Democrat Barack Obama's administration. In Minneapolis on Monday, tension and frustration over the presence of federal officials remained high, despite the news that Bovino and some agents would be leaving. \"A lot of people aren't able to work right now, they aren't able to leave their house, they're afraid,\" said George Cordero, a resident of St Paul, Minneapolis', sister city. Pretti was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state; Renee Nicole Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Border Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January. Much of the anger in the city and from politicians on both sides of the aisle was directed at Bovino and border patrol agents sent to Minneapolis along with ICE agents at Trump's directive. In total, there are more than 3,000 immigration agents in the city. Some media reports on Monday suggested Bovino had been let go from his role, but Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin refuted that, saying the border patrol chief \"is a key part of the President's team and a great American\". Carol Engelheart, a retired nurse from Minneapolis, said she has been deeply emotional about the events of the past few days. \"We need to care about this country, we need to care that we have a Constitution left, and if the people organize and the people stand up, we can do this,\" she said, as she chided immigration enforcement actions in the city.\n\nAlso on Monday, Trump spoke will both Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - democratic leaders who have resisted the immigration efforts and demanded agents be removed from the state. Trump has criticised both in recent weeks. Both Trump and the local leaders characterised the talks as positive and said they discussed a pathway forward - a sign that both sides were seeking a way to end their standoff over Trump's deportation drive. Trump said he and Walz are \"on a similar wavelength\" and said his target is \"any and all criminals that they have in their possession\". \"The President agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and to talk to DHS about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,\" Walz said after the call. Ensuring an independent investigation into Pretti's death, has been a central focus for Walz. In its immediate aftermath, local authorities obtained a judicial warrant to gain access to the crime scene to preserve evidence. Local officials have condemned the federal government investigation and said they were not being allowed to access the crime scene and evidence following Pretti's death.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General on border tsar Tom Homan's visit to Minneapolis", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:06:52 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-27T04:00:20.262609"}

Both India and the EU are seeking to strengthen strategic and trade ties with the rest of the world as they contend with economic and geopolitical pressure from the US.\n\nDelhi is grappling with 50% tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last year amid talks aimed at securing a trade deal between India and the US that are still dragging on. The EU has just emerged from a stressful week after Trump threatened to escalate his trade war with European allies for opposing a US takeover of Greenland before backing off. That larger geopolitical context was evident in recent statements made by leaders. The trade deal will send an \"important political message to the world that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs\" at a time when protectionism is on the rise and \"some countries have decided to increase tariffs\", Costa said on Monday without naming the US. Von der Leyen said that Europe and India are \"committed to working together to shape a new global order\". India and EU set for 'mother of all deals' as Trump's tariff uncertainty looms Von der Leyen and Costa arrived in Delhi over the weekend and were the chief guests at India's colourful Republic Day celebrations on Monday. On Tuesday, they will meet Modi and attend a bilateral summit, after which the deal is expected to be formally announced. The formal signing is likely to take place only later this year, after the agreement is approved by the European Parliament and the European Council.\n\nNarendra Modi/X (From left), Von der Leyen, Modi, Costa, Indian President Droupadi Murmu and others during the Republic Day celebrations on Monday", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:29:31 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-27T06:51:56.930200"}

The US has struck at least 36 vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific since September, killing more than 120 people. The Trump administration has said it is targeting \"narco-terrorists\" carrying drugs that kill Americans.\n\nThe US has positioned its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.\n\nThis lawsuit was filed on Tuesday under the Death on the High Seas Act, which allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths on the high seas, and is a statute that allows foreign citizens to sue in US courts for violating international law. The case was brought by Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister, who say the two men did fishing and farm work in Venezuela, and were returning to Trinidad and Tobago when their boat was struck. Joseph's mother Sallycar Korasingh added that if the US government believed her son had done something wrong, \"it should have arrested, charged and detained him, not murdered him\". The lawsuit argues that the killings should be deemed a wrongful death because the men were not taking part in military hostilities against the US. The Pentagon has not yet responded to requests for comment. It comes after the family of a Colombian man, who was killed in a separate US strike, took their case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:24:23 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-27T20:58:30.248348"}

Joel Guerriau received a four-year prison sentence - 18 months of which are to be served behind bars - and, according to local media, was ordered to pay Sandrine Josso €5,000 (£4,348) in damages for emotional distress. Guerriau, now 68, had invited Josso, 50, to his Paris flat in November 2023. He later admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA, but maintained it was an accident and denied having any intention of assaulting her. Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said it was a \"huge relief\", AFP reports. Meanwhile, Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal.\n\nAccording to court documents quoted by French media, Josso said she had gone to Guerrieau's home three years ago to celebrate his re-election when she started feeling unwell after drinking from a champagne glass. \"I had gone to visit a friend and I discovered an aggressor,\" she said on Monday while giving evidence in the trial. \"He looked at me insistently, I'd never seen him that way. I didn't want to show him my weakness, because I was worried that if I told him I wasn't feeling well, he would've forced me to lie down.\" Josso recalled managing to leave the flat and, with the help of a colleague, went to hospital where a toxicology report confirmed her blood had three times the recreational dose of MDMA. Guerriau told the court he had been going through a period of depression, and had meant to take the drug himself the night before. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he said. \"I feel sorry for Sandrine,\" Guerriau told the court in Paris. \"I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity.\" He added: \"We don't talk about the effects of these drugs enough...

Trump's remarks are the latest sign his administration is taking a step back on its operations in Minnesota.\n\nIn early January Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed after being stopped by border agents this past weekend.\n\n\"Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible,\" he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration was \"going to de-escalate a little bit\" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pulled the Minnesota mission's leader and figurehead, Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, from the state.\n\nDHS said it was deploying the White House's border tsar, Tom Homan, to take over there and Homan was set to meet with local officials this week. On Tuesday, Homan posted on social media that he had met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and local law enforcement officials.\n\nSpeaking to other reporters ahead of a rally in Iowa Tuesday night, Trump said he viewed the killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a veterans' hospital, as \"a very unfortunate incident\".\n\nAsked by reporters about whether he agreed with characterisations of Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump said: \"I haven't heard that.\"\n\nTrump then added: \"He shouldn't have been carrying a gun.\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun during a confrontation, but local authorities said the gun was legally registered and that Pretti was shot after the firearm was removed.\n\nDHS has also said the agents fired in self-defence, after Pretti resisted attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses and local officials, though, have challenged that account, saying he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.\n\n\"He wasn't there to peacefully protest, he was there to perpetuate violence,\" Noem said in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, accusing Pretti of \"domestic terrorism\".\n\nPretti's death, coming two weeks after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, enraged local residents and sparked fresh calls from state and city officials for the Trump administration to withdraw its 3,000 immigration agents and officers from the region.\n\nIn the interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to defend the Minnesota operation, saying \"we took thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state, \"so they have good crime numbers.\"\n\n\"That's all working out, we have Tom Homan there now,\" he said, before adding the administration would \"de-escalate\".\n\nStephen Miller, a top White House aide working on the administration's deportation initiative, told CNN that the White House \"provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors\".\n\n\"We are evaluating why the [US Customs and Border Patrol] team may not have been following that protocol,\" Miller said in his statement to CNN.\n\nSome Republican leaders and lawmakers have called for an investigation into Pretti's death, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott and US Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.\n\n\"The nation witnessed a horrifying situation this weekend,\" Ricketts wrote on X. While he reaffirmed his \"support for funding ICE remains the same,\" Ricketts said he expected \"a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident\".\n\nA federal judge has blocked DHS from destroying or altering evidence.\n\nIn his speech at the Iowa rally on Tuesday night, which was dedicated to his economic policies, Trump did not discuss the current situation in Minnesota in-depth, but talked about his immigration crackdown more broadly, citing a Harvard Harris poll from December that suggested 80% of Americans support his administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:33:26 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-28T02:12:03.690556"}

The White House has said Homan, who arrived in Minneapolis on Tuesday, will now be the \"main point of contact on the ground\" and will meet with city officials. It comes as Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief and public face of the Trump administration's mass deportation drive in cities across the US, is expected to leave the city along with some of his agents. Homan, 64, is seen both as a key Trump ally and someone with decades of experience in immigration policy across both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nHe is also one of the most vocal defenders of Trump's immigration policy and mass deportation drive. A native of upstate New York, Homan began his career in law enforcement as a police officer before joining border patrol in 1984 in southern California. He joined what was then called the Immigration and Naturalization Service four years later, climbing through the ranks of US immigration enforcement over multiple years. By 2013 - under the Obama administration - he held a little-known but influential post heading the Enforcement and Removal Operations arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) Homan had planned to retire in 2017, just days before Trump's first administration began. An abrupt call at his retirement party from incoming Chief of Staff John Kelly changed those plans. \"I remember him saying, I know it was bad timing, but the president-elect wanted me to stay and run [ICE],\" Homan recalled in an interview last year with the Daily Caller. \"Monday morning, I called [Kelly] and said I want to come back.\" A similar call, this time from current Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, again brought him out of retirement in 2024 ahead of the second administration. While \"border tsar\" is an informal term and position, it refers to an executive-branch role overseeing border and immigration policy across multiple agencies. It is not Senate confirmed, and is a policy position directly appointed by the serving president. So far in Trump's second term, Homan has been a vocal defender of the president's broad deportation goals, vowing to target the \"worst of the worst\" and challenge the notion that \"those who enforce the law are the bad guys and those who break the law are the victims\". But in practice, enforcing immigration laws and attempting to focus on public safety threats has also ensnared other undocumented migrants who have no criminal background - a fact that Homan acknowledges and blames on \"sanctuary cities\" that do not work with federal immigration efforts. Officials have said the act of being in the US illegally is a crime in itself. \"We're not going to instruct ICE not to arrest [someone] unless there's a serious crime,\" he told reporters in July at the White House, where he makes regular appearances. \"What message does that send the whole world? Go ahead and enter the country,\" Homan added. In September, the White House swiftly came to Homan's defence after reports emerged that he was accused in a bribery case that was ultimately dropped by the justice department when Trump returned to office. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described that case - which allegedly saw Homan accept $50,000 (£36,3000) from undercover agents - as an effort to \"entrap\" a key Trump ally.\n\nWho is Greg Bovino and why is he being replaced?\n\nGetty Images Gregory Bovino's aggressive tactics have sparked controversy and criticism from lawmakers - including Republicans.\n\nUnlike Homan, Bovino has spent almost his entire law enforcement career in border cities, having first joined Border Patrol in 1996 and serving in a variety of US domestic postings as well as overseas in Honduras and Africa. The North Carolina native rose to prominence in Trump's second term, taking the lead during immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis. Bovino has been serving as \"commander-at-large\" in Border Patrol - an informal role outside of the organisation's formal hierarchy. Border Patrol is one of several immigration-centred agencies that operates under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Bovino reportedly answers directly to DHS head Kristi Noem. In his informal role, he works alongside officials like the Chief of Border Patrol, a position held by Michael Banks, and the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, a position currently held by Rodney Scott. Bovino's tactics have been both controversial, particularly the aggressive \"turn and burn\" method of making swift arrests before protesters can arrive to an area. \"We're going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next,\" he told the AP of the tactic. \"We're not going to stop.\" Bovino has also earned a reputation as an official willing to clash with lawmakers. In recent days, for example, Bovino has publicly sparred with lawmakers from both parties who expressed concern about his operations in Minneapolis.\n\nWill leadership switch mean change in Minneapolis?", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:17:35 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-28T02:12:03.861358"}

But even as some Republicans in Washington speak out against the fatal shootings, they've avoided directly criticising President Donald Trump or his broader immigration agenda. The emerging messaging on Minneapolis points to the party's main dilemma heading into the midterm elections: whether and how to distance itself from the biggest controversies of Trump's second term, while running on his overall record on immigration and other issues - a record that's popular on the right, and that most Republicans helped push through Congress. Their response to the fast-moving events in Minneapolis underscores the delicate balancing act.\n\nPublic anger forces a new focus\n\nSo far, Republicans have focused criticism on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE - the agency at the forefront of the Minneapolis operation - and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security taking part. At the same time, Republicans have backed Trump's immigration plans since his return to the White House, but now avoid highlighting their support. Last year, the Republican-controlled Congress approved roughly $45 billion for border security and additional funding for interior enforcement to help the administration carry out Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the country. That support continued as opinion polls have consistently shown a majority of Americans believe ICE has gone too far in its tactics under Trump. A New York Times/Siena poll out last Friday found that 61 percent of voters believe ICE's tactics have \"gone too far.\" The survey came out two weeks after Renee Good, a US citizen, was fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis, and one day before another American citizen, Alex Pretti, was killed by agents in the city, sparking nationwide protests. In the face of public outcry over the killings, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, called on Monday for the leaders of ICE and two other federal agencies to testify before his panel next month. The request came alongside calls from other Senate Republicans for more oversight of ICE after Pretti's shooting. \"The tragedy and chaos the country is witnessing in Minneapolis is shocking,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska wrote on social media. \"ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.\" Murkowski's condemnation does not come as a major surprise. The Alaska moderate is one of a small handful of Republicans in Congress who've been willing to openly criticise Trump since he first entered office. Paul also has clashed with the president and administration on issues in the past. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina on Tuesday became one of the first prominent Republicans to call for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to step down. Noem \"has proven to be way out of her depth,\" Tillis told reporters, adding that her leadership in Minnesota \"should be disqualifying.\" The White House has said Trump has confidence in Noem.\n\nFacing 'serious, unanswered questions'\n\nModerate Republicans like Murkowski aren't the only ones in the party criticising the immigration operation in Minnesota. In recent days some of Trump's allies in Congress also began speaking out against the shootings, though most issued carefully worded statements that didn't explicitly mention the president. \"There are serious unanswered questions about federal use of force in Minnesota. Transparency and accountability are essential,\" said Representative Max Miller of Ohio, a former Trump adviser. Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, called on the heads of ICE and other agencies to testify before Congress. Garbarino also came out in support of a full investigation into Pretti's shooting. \"Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect,\" Garbarino said. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas issued a more direct criticism of the administration after the Pretti shooting. But he focused on the administration's rhetoric in response to the shooting and didn't break with Trump's larger agenda. \"What I think the administration could do better is the tone with which they're describing this - that immediately when an incident like this happens, they come out guns blazing that we took out a violent terrorist, hooray,\" Cruz said Monday on his podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz. The Republican response also is complicated by the gun ownership debate that has pitted the administration against the National Rifle Association, a traditional ally of the political right. A Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in Los Angeles said in a social media post after Pretti's death that people who approach law enforcement officials armed should expect that there is a \"high likelihood\" they'll get shot. The NRA slammed the remarks. \"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens,\" the NRA said in a statement. Some Republican lawmakers defend immigration enforcement underway in Minneapolis and other US cities. Trump's immigration policies remain popular with the party's base, and after the recent shootings in Minneapolis some Republican voters in the state told the BBC they didn't think the president should do anything differently. \"They're just doing their job, which is right,\" Jay Cielinski, said of ICE in an interview Tuesday in his hometown of Zimmerman, a roughly 50-minute drive north of Minneapolis. The 59-year-old home inspector and self-described Trump supporter also said protesters, and state and local officials shouldn't interfere with federal immigration operations, a view echoed by many Republicans including Trump and other senior administration officials. \"They should stay at home, stay out of the way,\" Cielinski said of people who protest federal immigration operations. \"Law enforcement officials at the city, state, county [levels] should be encouraging ICE to go in. They should expose the people that are illegal.\" Still, the cautious rebukes from Cruz and other prominent Republicans in Washington signaled an attempt to hold the administration accountable without alienating supporters like Cielinski.\n\nPivoting to a softer approach", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 02:29:26 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-28T03:54:18.662160"}

The airport is next to Base Aérienne 101, a military base previously used by American and then Russian troops.\n\nA source with the Togolese airline Asky, told the Guardian that gunshots caused several holes in the fuselage of its two planes on the tarmac of Niamey airport. Staff were at their hotel at the time but remained stranded in the country.\n\n“They destroyed both aircraft … they left evidence at the scene,” the source said.\n\nIt remains unclear who fired the shots or whether there were any casualties. Authorities in Niger are yet to comment on the developing situation.\n\nIn July 2023, Niger’s presidential guard, led by Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, overthrew the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, marking the seventh successful coup in West and Central Africa in three years at that point. There have been at least one successful coup and two failed attempts in the region since the Niger coup.\n\nThe junta suspended the constitution and faced international condemnation and aid cuts. After the Economic Community of West African States imposed sanctions and threatened military intervention, Niger withdrew from the regional bloc alongside Mali and Burkina Faso – both also under military rule – to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) in September 2023. Niger also expelled French and US forces, signalling a geopolitical realignment away from former traditional allies.\n\nThe country is still grappling with jihadism, as armed groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda affiliates continue to attack the tri-border region with Mali and Burkina Faso in particular. The security situation has deteriorated significantly since the coup despite the junta’s promises to restore stability.\n\nThe Global Terrorism Index 2025 reports that Niger recorded the largest increase in terrorism deaths globally in 2024, rising by 94% to a total of 930 deaths, the country’s worst ranking since the index began.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Thu, 29 Jan 2026 10:33:00 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-29T10:45:33.673028"}

Israel’s embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n“This decisive measure follows a series of unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms and practice which pose a direct challenge to South Africa’s sovereignty”, the statement said.\n\n“These violations include the repeated use of official Israeli social media platforms to launch insulting attacks against His Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa, and a deliberate failure to inform DIRCO of purported visits by senior Israeli officials.”\n\nSouth Africa’s relationship with Israel deteriorated in December 2023, when South Africa launched a case at the international court of justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nIn January 2024, the ICJ ruled that the claim of genocide was “plausible”. However, the case has since slowed and experts do not expect a judgment before the end of 2027. Israel has rejected accusations of genocide as “outrageous and false”.\n\nSouth Africa and Israel have long been at odds, due to the staunch support of the Palestinian cause by South Africa’s government. Soon after his release from prison in 1990, Nelson Mandela embraced the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. In 1997, Mandela, by then president of South Africa, said: “Our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.”\n\nMany South Africans see strong similarities between apartheid white minority rule and Israel’s grip over the occupied Palestinian territories, a comparison Israel refutes.\n\nIsrael’s embassy in South Africa has regularly attacked the government on social media. “The South African government has thrown away R100 million [£4.6m] attacking Israel at the ICJ – with another R500 million to be wasted next year. 0% of value for South Africans, 100% political theatre,” it posted on X in November.\n\nLater that month, Ramaphosa said “boycott politics don’t work” in response to Donald Trump’s refusal to attend the G20 summit in South Africa. Israel’s embassy posted: “A rare moment of wisdom and diplomatic clarity from President Ramaphosa.”\n\nSouth African officials were angered earlier this week when Israeli diplomats met the Thembu king, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, in the Eastern Cape province to discuss Israel providing agriculture, water and health aid, without first informing the government.\n\nDalindyebo is pro-Israel and visited the country in December, where he was welcomed by the Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar.\n\nEastern Cape’s premier Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane said in a statement that he “rejects the sinister deal between the ing and Israel, and views these actions as an attempt by the Israeli government to undermine the sovereign right of the Republic of South Africa to manage its international affairs.”\n\nDIRCO said in its Friday statement: “Such actions represent a gross abuse of diplomatic privilege and a fundamental breach of the Vienna convention.”\n\nIsrael’s embassy posted videos of Dalindyebo welcoming the offers of aid on X. “These are the videos the South African media didn’t want you to see,” it said.\n\nMandela was also part of the Thembu clan, whose historic kingdom is now home to more than 400,000 people.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:11:55 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-30T14:56:54.750931"}

A source at Asky told the Guardian that the airline staff were in their hotel away from the scene and remain in the city, with their passports still in the custody of the authorities.\n\nNiger, which has been led by a junta since the deposition of democratically elected Mohamed Bazoum in July 2023, has previously blamed the chaos on its neighbours Benin and Côte d’Ivoire, as well as former colonial ruler France, without presenting any backing evidence.\n\n“We have heard them bark, they should be ready to hear us roar,” the head of the junta, Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, said on national television on Thursday. The statement is expected to further strain the relationships between Niger and its neighbours in the regional Economic Community of West African States and its former ally France, which have soured since the 2023 coup.\n\nSince the coup, Niger has exited Ecowas, joining ranks with fellow junta-run states Burkina Faso and Mali to form the Association of Sahel States (AES), which has issued its own passports and set up a regional development institution, the Confederal Bank for Investment and Development. AES sees some of its Ecowas neighbours as French proxies scheming along with Paris to derail development in the Sahel states as they grapple with jihadist activity.\n\nIn its statement on Thursday, Nigerien authorities said the attackers arrived on motorcycles, and security forces quickly repelled their advance, killing 20 of the attackers and arresting 11 others. A stash of ammunition also caught fire, the government said.\n\nThe Niamey attack happened about the same time as an attack using drones by jihadists in neighbouring Nigeria. The attack by the Islamic State West Africa Province in the early hours of Thursday at the Sabon Gari army base in the north-east state of Borno left at least nine soldiers dead and several others wounded.", "language": "en", "category": "politics", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "published": "Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:57:44 GMT", "fetched_at": "2026-01-30T16:21:41.029859"}
