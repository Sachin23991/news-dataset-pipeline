As we like to do on The Vergecast, we take this time of year to see our families, relax and recharge, and go extremely deep into a specific technology that matters right now. This year, we picked the tiny chip in all your devices that is suddenly a precious and expensive commodity: RAM.\n\nOn this episode, David and Nilay are joined by The Verge’s Sean Hollister to get a primer on all things Random Access Memory. The hosts talk through the history of the technology, what RAM made possible in our computers, how it became utterly ubiquitous in practically every electronic device we own, and why it’s so hard to get right now. (Here’s a very 2025 spoiler alert: it’s about AI.) Then, with the help of producer Travis Larchuk, we play some RAM-related games, which go… well, they go.\n\nAfter that, Sean and David chat with Dylan Patel from Semianalysis, who explains why the chip market in general is so overwhelmed right now — and why even in boom times, some companies might be reluctant to invest too heavily in scaling up. He also explains how the AI companies have cornered the market on RAM, whether the data center boom will end anytime soon, and what it all means for the prices of our devices.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who has listened to, watched, and talked with us about The Vergecast this year. Have a happy, restful, memory-filled holiday, and we’ll see you in 2026! Maybe even at our CES live show in Las Vegas!\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T09:35:49-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:38.419329"}

Instead of running my routine, it told me it couldn’t do that. Ever since I upgraded to Alexa Plus, Amazon’s generative-AI-powered voice assistant, it has failed to reliably run my coffee routine, coming up with a different excuse almost every time I ask.\n\nIt’s 2025, and AI still can’t reliably control my smart home. I’m beginning to wonder if it ever will.\n\nThe potential for generative AI and large language models to take the complexity out of the smart home, making it easier to set up, use, and manage connected devices, is compelling. So is the promise of a “new intelligence layer” that could unlock a proactive, ambient home.\n\nBut this year has shown me that we are a long way from any of that. Instead, our reliable but limited voice assistants have been replaced with “smarter” versions that, while better conversationalists, can’t consistently do basic tasks like operating appliances and turning on the lights. I want to know why.\n\nI’m still waiting on the promise of voice assistants that can seamlessly control my smart home. Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nThis wasn’t the future we were promised.\n\nIt was back in 2023, during an interview with Dave Limp, that I first became intrigued by the possibilities of generative AI and large language models for improving the smart home experience. Limp, then the head of Amazon’s Devices & Services division that oversees Alexa, was describing the capabilities of the new Alexa they were soon to launch (spoiler alert: it wasn’t soon).\n\nAlong with a more conversational assistant that could actually understand what you said no matter how you said it, what stood out to me was the promise that this new Alexa could use its knowledge of the devices in your smart home, combined with the hundreds of APIs they plugged into it, to give the assistant the context it needed to make your smart home easier to use.\n\nFrom setting up devices to controlling them, unlocking all their features, and managing how they can interact with other devices, a smarter smart home assistant seemed to hold the potential to not only make it easier for enthusiasts to manage their gadgets but also make it easier for everyone to enjoy the benefits of the smart home.\n\nFast-forward three years, and the most useful smart home AI upgrade we have is AI-powered descriptions for security camera notifications. It’s handy, but it’s hardly the sea change I had hoped for.\n\nIt’s not that these new smart home assistants are a complete failure. There’s a lot I like about Alexa Plus; I even named it as my smart home software pick of the year. It is more conversational, understands natural language, and can answer many more random questions than the old Alexa.\n\nWhile it sometimes struggles with basic commands, it can understand complex ones; saying “I want it dimmer in here and warmer” will adjust the lights and crank up the thermostat. It’s better at managing my calendar, helping me cook, and other home-focused features. Setting up routines with voice is a huge improvement over wrestling with the Alexa app — even if running them isn’t as reliable.\n\nGoogle’s new Gemini for Home AI-powered smart home assistant won’t fully launch until next spring, when its new smart speaker arrives. Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nThe problem is that the new assistants aren’t as consistent at controlling smart home devices as the old ones. While they were often frustrating to use, the old Alexa and Google Assistant (and the current Siri) would generally always turn on the lights when you asked them to, provided you used precise nomenclature.\n\nToday, their “upgraded” counterparts struggle with consistency in basic functions like turning on the lights, setting timers, reporting on the weather, playing music, and running the routines and automations on which many of us have built our smart homes.\n\nWhy is this, and will it ever get better? To understand the problem, I spoke with two professors in the field of human-centric artificial intelligence with experience with agentic AI and smart home systems. My takeaway from those conversations is that, while it’s possible to make these new voice assistants do almost exactly what the old ones did, it will take a lot of work, and that’s possibly work most companies just aren’t interested in doing.\n\nBasically, we’re all beta testers for the AI.\n\nConsidering there are limited resources in this field and ample opportunity to do something much more exciting (and more profitable) than reliably turn on the lights, that’s the way they’re moving, according to experts I spoke with. Given all these factors, it seems the easiest way to improve the technology is to just deploy it in the real world and let it improve over time. Which is likely why Alexa Plus and Gemini for Home are in “early access” phases. Basically, we’re all beta testers for the AI.\n\nThe bad news is it could be a while until it gets better. In his research, Dhruv Jain, assistant professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Michigan and director of the Soundability Lab, has also found that newer models of smart home assistants are less reliable. “It’s more conversational, people like it, people like to talk to it, but it’s not as good as the previous one,” he says. “I think [tech companies’] model has always been to release it fairly fast, collect data, and improve on it. So, over a few years, we might get a better model, but at the cost of those few years of people wrestling with it.”\n\nThe Alexa that launched in 2014 on the original Echo smart speaker isn’t capable enough for the future Amazon is working toward. Image: Amazon\n\nThe inherent problem appears to be that the old and new technologies don’t mesh. So, to build their new voice assistants, Amazon, Google, and Apple have had to throw out the old and build something entirely new. However, they quickly discovered that these new LLMs were not designed for the predictability and repetitiveness that their predecessors excelled at. “It was not as trivial an upgrade as everyone originally thought,” says Mark Riedl, a professor at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. “LLMs understand a lot more and are open to more arbitrary ways to communicate, which then opens them to interpretation and interpretation mistakes.”\n\nBasically, LLMs just aren’t designed to do what prior command-and-control-style voice assistants did. “Those voice assistants are what we call ‘template matchers,’” explains Riedl. “They look for a keyword, when they see it, they know that there are one to three additional words to expect.” For example, you say “Play radio,” and they know to expect a station call code next.\n\n“It was not as trivial an upgrade as everyone originally thought.” — Mark Riedl\n\nLLMs, on the other hand, “bring in a lot of stochasticity — randomness,” explains Riedl. Asking ChatGPT the same prompt multiple times may produce multiple responses. This is part of their value, but it’s also why when you ask your LLM-powered voice assistant to do the same thing you asked it yesterday, it might not respond the same way. “This randomness can lead to misunderstanding basic commands because sometimes they try to overthink things too much,” he says.\n\nTo fix this, companies like Amazon and Google have developed ways to integrate LLMs with the APIs at the heart of our smart homes (and most of everything we do on the web). But this has potentially created a new problem.\n\n“The LLMs now have to compose a function call to an API, and it has to work a whole lot harder to correctly create the syntax to get the call exactly right,” Riedl posits. Where the old systems just waited for the keyword, LLM-powered assistants now have to lay out an entire code sequence that the API can recognize. “It has to keep all that in memory, and it’s another place where it can make mistakes.”\n\nAll of this is a scientific way of explaining why my coffee machine sometimes won’t make me a cup of coffee, or why you might run into trouble getting Alexa or Google’s assistant to do something it used to do just fine.\n\nSo, why did these companies abandon a technology that worked for something that doesn’t? Because of its potential. A voice assistant that, rather than being limited to responding to specific inputs, can understand natural language and take action based on that understanding is infinitely more capable.\n\n“What all the companies that make Alexa and Siri and things like that really want to do is chaining of services,” explains Riedl. “That’s where you want a general language understanding, something that can understand complex relationships through tasks and how they’re conveyed by speech. They can invent the if-else statements that chain everything together, on the fly, and dynamically generate the sequence.” They can become agentic.\n\n“The question is whether … the expanded range of possibilities the new technology offers is worth more than a 100 percent accurate non-probabilistic model.” — Dhruv Jain\n\nThis is why you throw away the old technology, says Riedl, because it had no chance of doing this. “It’s about the cost-benefit ratio,” says Jain. “[The new technology] is not ever going to be as accurate at this as the non-probabilistic technology before, but the question is whether that sufficiently high accuracy, plus the expanded range of possibilities the new technology offers, is worth more than a 100 percent accurate non-probabilistic model.”\n\nOne solution is to use multiple models to power these assistants. Google’s Gemini for Home consists of two separate systems: Gemini and Gemini Live. Anish Kattukaran, head of product at Google Home and Nest, says the aim is to eventually have the more powerful Gemini Live run everything, but today, the more tightly constrained Gemini for Home is in charge. Amazon similarly uses multiple models to balance its various capabilities. But it’s an imperfect solution that has led to inconsistency and confusion in our smart homes.\n\nRiedl says that no one has really figured out how to train LLMs to understand when to be very precise and when to embrace randomness, meaning even the “tame” LLMs can still get things wrong. “If you wanted to have a machine that just was never random at all, you could tamp it all down,” says Riedl. But that same chatbot would not be more conversational or able to tell your kid fantastical bedtime stories — both capabilities that Alexa and Google are touting. “If you want it all in one, you’re really making some tradeoffs.”\n\nThese struggles in its deployment in the smart home could be a harbinger of broader issues for the technology. If AI can’t turn on the lights reliably, why should anyone rely on it to do more complex tasks, asks Riedl. “You have to walk before you can run.”\n\nBut tech companies are known for their propensity to move fast and break things. “The story of language models has always been about taming the LLMs,” says Riedl. “Over time, they become more tame, more reliable, more trustworthy. But we keep pushing into the fringe of those spaces where they’re not.”\n\nRiedl does believe in the path to a purely agentic assistant. “I don’t know if we ever get to AGI, but I think over time we do see these things at least being more reliable.” The question for those of us dealing with these unreliable AIs in our homes today, however, is are we willing to wait and at what cost to the smart home in the meantime?", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T08:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:38.628100"}

The year before, Congress had overwhelmingly passed a bill banning TikTok unless it broke ties with its Chinese parent company. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld it, and it was clear what needed to happen next: either the president could give TikTok another 90 days to complete a deal or it would be banned immediately.\n\nBut neither of those things happened. Outgoing President Joe Biden punted the decision to incoming President Donald Trump, and after a dramatic few hours where TikTok took itself offline in the US, it returned with a triumphant message thanking Trump for saving it.\n\nNearly a year and four extra-legal extensions later, TikTok remains in the States, owned by the same Chinese company lawmakers warned would gravely endanger US national security. It only recently announced it had finalized a deal to sell its US-based business, with a targeted closing date of January 22nd, 2026 — more than a year after it was first supposed to be banned. The whole ordeal felt like a comedy of errors, where ultimately everyone threw up their hands. The few details known about a supposedly coming deal raise questions about whether it will even comply with the law’s original requirements.\n\nThe failure to take any action at all against TikTok following the panic around its alleged national security risks is just one of many cracks to the federal government’s foundation this year. In March, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth communicated war plans over Signal — an encrypted messaging platform but not one meant for such a use case due to potential security risks on users’ devices — which we only found out about because Trump’s then-national security adviser apparently accidentally added the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic to that chat.\n\nAnd then there was the biggest full-on rupture to the government in 2025: Elon Musk’s pet project, DOGE\n\nThere have been many other instances where democracy’s counterweights have shown signs of life, and at times, even bravery\n\nOf course, the only true test of a democracy’s durability is to see how its checks fare when things break. The TikTok saga shows one example where — at least so far — they have weathered poorly. Congress has issued tepid statements about the executive branch’s unwillingness to enforce the law, but there’s no appetite to impeach Trump over it, and the judicial branch can’t or won’t force action, either. But there have been many other instances where democracy’s counterweights have shown signs of life, and at times, even bravery.\n\nAs 2026 approaches, political posturing for the midterms is likely to overshadow any real efforts at policymaking. With that will come a slew of messages from politicians promising to fix what was broken this year and also promising to break what hasn’t worked in far too long.

The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) says that Apple abused its dominant app store market position by burdening developers with “disproportionate” terms around data collection that exceed privacy law requirements, compared to rules for native iOS apps.\n\nThe fine specifically targets the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy Apple launched in 2021, which requires third-party developers to ask users for consent twice to track their data across other apps and websites.

He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAs a reluctant doomsday prepper and eager vanlifer, Dometic’s battery-powered Go Faucet has, for the last few years, played a central role in my bougie bug-out kit and my camping rig’s water system. So it took me all of two minutes with Dometic’s new Recon 360 Faucet to realize it’s an upgrade in every single way that matters — and then confirmed after a week of testing it.\n\nThe Recon 360 Faucet lets you pump water out of a storage container like a typical faucet in places that lack traditional plumbing, be it inside a boat, cabin, or van, or at the beach, job site, or campground. A long silicone water hose attaches to the back of the faucet and snaps into the CPC quick-connect fitting found on Dometic’s Go Jug or Recon Hardside Coolers. But there’s nothing to stop you from dropping that tube into any jerry can via a third-party CPC adapter. It also works with inline filters like the one I use from LifeStraw and Camelbak.\n\nAs to the upgrades, the Recon 360 Faucet ditches the easy-to-miss touch surface for real mechanical buttons. One button produces a standard water flow to brush your teeth or fill a glass, and the second, larger button emits a more forceful stream for washing dishes, your hair, or quickly filling a water bottle before heading out on a hike. The water stream shuts off with a second press of the active button, otherwise it’ll automatically stop the flow after 90 seconds or 1.5L/3L to avoid depleting that precious resource.\n\nIt’s very small and portable with a battery good for about 150 liters. Here in my van, the rotating base prevents the stiff water tube from twisting the faucet away from the sink. Stacked on top of Dometic’s 11-liter Go Jug, where the water tube connects through that white CPC coupler on top. The light is very useful at night. Pictured here in a blacked-out room.\n\nIn my testing, pressing the smaller button extracts one liter of water in 41 seconds (at a loud 52dB from arm’s length), while the fast button yields one liter in just 24 seconds at an even louder 60dB. The low-flow mode is quieter than the original one-button Go Faucet, with a less annoying drone due to its lower pitch. However, it’s still too loud for vanlifers to sneak a glass of water at night while others sleep, although the bright LED light that illuminates the stream certainly makes it possible.\n\nAnd as the name suggests, the base can now be rotated 360 degrees for more placement options. It’s a welcome change that should reduce the number of times I have to clean water off my kitchen counter when the stiff, crimp-resistant water hose — included with both Dometic models — caused the lightweight Go Faucet to twist away from the sink.\n\nThankfully, the new tap has also been migrated from Micro USB to a USB-C connector for charging, with a battery that’s still good for about 150 liters (about 40 gallons). The Recon 360 Faucet now also has a 4-stage LED meter on top that shows the remaining charge.\n\nThe faucet is slightly smaller but a little heavier than the Go model. It comes with a selection of metal pucks that can be adhered to a countertop or water jug to create a platform for the faucet’s magnetic base. The force of the new magnet feels about twice as strong as the older model, which should hold the faucet in place better when driving down bumpy roads. That’s good because I’ve sent my Go Faucet flying through the van about five or six times now, yet it just keeps on pumping. I hope the Recon 360 Faucet is just as durable.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 9 The water hose clicks into the Dometic Go Jug (shown here), Dometic’s new Recon Hardside Coolers, and even generic jerry cans that use universal CPC couplers.\n\nThe only real issue is the price: $149.99 for the Recon 360 Faucet, instead of $99.99 for the Go Faucet, which Dometic still sells. The Go Faucet is great, but the Recon 360 fixes so many little complaints that I think it’s worth every extra penny. Yes, there are cheaper and less-functional alternatives to be had on Amazon and AliExpress, but if you need to use a portable faucet regularly, like I do, then Dometic’s durable and feature-rich faucets won’t disappoint if you can afford them.\n\nAll photography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T05:44:07-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:39.123442"}

Here’s how to sift through the acronyms, storage options, and extra features to find the best one for you.", "content": "Buying a laptop is an exercise in confusion. Even if you know what everything means and exactly what you want, finding it can be difficult. Heck, just navigating the manufacturer's website to locate the model you want is frustrating. We hope this guide will help you traverse the morass of modern laptops. Below is a section on every major component you'll want to know about when you browse for the best laptop for you. We break down the jargon and explain things on a practical level, so you end up with a machine that's the right fit.\n\nUpdated December 2025: We've added the latest chip news from Intel, AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm. We also have details about the incoming memory shortage and the future of ChromeOS.\n\nUnderstanding Use Cases and Budget\n\nBefore getting into the nitty-gritty, I always recommend starting with the biggest question first: What will you do with your new laptop? Is this a business machine meant primarily for office work and other simple tasks that can be done in a browser? Or perhaps you have a burgeoning interest in a hobby like PC gaming, video editing, coding, or design. Maybe one of those hobbies is more of a job for you, meaning you'll want something that is designed from the ground up to accelerate work in those applications. On the other side of the spectrum, maybe you plan to primarily use your laptop on the go, whether that's on a plane or in coffee shops. In that case, portability and battery life may be the most important factors to consider.\n\nThe answer to those questions will help point you in the right direction and ensure that you don't overspend on features or performance you don't need. For example, buying a MacBook Pro instead of a MacBook Air just because you have extra money to spend isn't a good idea. That brings us to the budget: $1,000 is an important price. There are many good options below that price, but it's the level at which you can expect laptops to feel premium and lack any significant compromises. It's the starting retail price of the starting MacBook Air, as well as several Windows laptops. Thanks to solid discounts, it's not uncommon to see these laptops dip in price to $700.\n\nSpeaking of Windows laptops, you'll have to be patient to find something under $600 that's still worth buying. If your budget is $500 or less, you're better off buying a Chromebook. They'll feel faster and lighter, and usually get longer battery life too, at least compared to similarly priced Windows laptops.\n\nWhich Operating System Is Best?\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nI won't waste your time repeating the same arguments you've probably already heard about why macOS is better than Windows, or vice versa. Both have strengths and weaknesses, and you likely already have opinions about them. The truth is that these operating systems are more similar today than they have ever been, not unlike Android and iOS. So if you're on the fence, I recommend opting for a laptop that runs whichever is most familiar.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:39.497323"}

Given the current RAM pricing issues, this is a better value than ever, and perhaps cheaper than an off-the-shelf build.\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nA Mixed Experience\n\nFirst, the good stuff: The GPU is packaged separately from the rest of the system, which may sound odd, but I've found that’s one of the most common pain points when shipping a new gaming PC. I’ve seen system builders use expanding foam, special brackets, and folded cardboard supports, among other solutions, but packing the graphics cards in its original box is far simpler and safer, and the other ways of shipping a PC with an installed graphics card still require opening the system up anyway. I do wish the instructions were more specific to the case, particularly since the PCIe bracket might be a little fiddly for total novices, but anyone who has worked with gaming systems in the past shouldn't have any issues.\n\nThe case isn't particularly unique or eye-catching, but it does have a wide, slightly smoky glass side panel that helps give it a clean silhouette. The dark tint allows the lights underneath to shine a bit without the whole system being overtly gamer-coded, but also makes them extremely reflective. There are no screws holding it in place, it’s just press fit, but it’s nice and sturdy, and I didn’t worry about it falling out. Like most glass panels, they inhibit airflow, so iBuyPower has set the front fan array an inch or so back from the panel, and added mesh sections at the top and bottom, which helps alleviate the issue.

Most of these fake images appear to be generated without the consent of the women in the photos. Some of these same users are also offering advice to others on how to use the generative AI tools to strip the clothes off of women in photos and make them appear to be wearing bikinis.\n\nUnder a now-deleted Reddit post titled “gemini nsfw image generation is so easy,” users traded tips for how to get Gemini, Google’s generative AI model, to make pictures of women in revealing clothes. Many of the images in the thread were entirely AI, but one request stood out.\n\nA user posted a photo of a woman wearing an Indian sari, asking for someone to “remove” her clothes and “put a bikini” on instead. Someone else replied with a deepfake image to fulfil the request. After WIRED notified Reddit about these posts and asked the company for comment, Reddit’s safety team removed the request and the AI deepfake.\n\n“Reddit's sitewide rules prohibit nonconsensual intimate media, including the behavior in question,” said a spokesperson. The subreddit where this discussion occurred, r/ChatGPTJailbreak, had over 200,000 followers before Reddit banned it under the platform’s “don't break the site” rule.\n\nAs generative AI tools that make it easy to create realistic but false images continue to proliferate, users of the tools have continued to harass women with nonconsensual deepfake imagery. Millions have visited harmful “nudify” websites, designed for users to upload real photos of people and request for them to be undressed using generative AI.\n\nWith xAI’s Grok as a notable exception, most mainstream chatbots don’t usually allow the generation of NSFW images in AI outputs. These bots, including Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, are also fitted with guardrails that attempt to block harmful generations.\n\nIn November, Google released Nano Banana Pro, a new imaging model that excels at tweaking existing photos and generating hyperrealistic images of people. OpenAI responded last week with its own updated imaging model, ChatGPT Images.\n\nAs these tools improve, likenesses may become more realistic when users are able to subvert guardrails.\n\nIn a separate Reddit thread about generating NSFW images, a user asked for recommendations on how to avoid guardrails when adjusting someone’s outfit to make the subject’s skirt appear tighter.

In 2025, all it takes to get away with tens of billions of dollars in black-market crypto deals is a messaging platform willing to host scammers and human traffickers, enough persistence to relaunch channels and accounts on that service when they’re occasionally banned, and fluency in Chinese.\n\nThe ecosystem of marketplaces for Chinese-speaking crypto scammers hosted on the messaging service Telegram have now grown to be bigger than ever before, according to a new analysis from the crypto tracing firm Elliptic. Despite a brief drop after Telegram banned two of the biggest such markets in early 2025, the two current top markets, known as Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee, are together enabling close to $2 billion a month in money-laundering transactions, sales of scam tools like stolen data, fake investment websites, and AI deepfake tools, as well as other black market services as varied as pregnancy surrogacy and teen prostitution.\n\nexpired: crypto markets for US drug dealers tired: crypto markets for Russian hackers wired: crypto markets for Chinese scammers Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nThe crypto romance and investment scams regrettably known as “pig butchering”—carried out largely from compounds in Southeast Asia staffed with thousands of human trafficking victims—have grown to become the world’s most lucrative form of cybercrime.

By selling money-laundering services and other scam-related offerings to those operations, markets like Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee have grown in parallel to an immense scale.\n\n“When you consider illicit use of crypto assets, there really isn’t anything larger right now,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s cofounder and chief scientist.\n\nIn fact, these criminal trading zones aren’t simply the biggest online black markets of the moment, but the biggest in history. AlphaBay was once the biggest dark-web market for drugs, stolen data, and hacking tools. Described by the FBI as 10 times the size of the original Silk Road dark-web drug market at its peak, AlphaBay facilitated more than $1 billion in transactions over its two and a half years online. Hydra, a Russian dark-web market that also offered money-laundering services to cryptocurrency thieves and ransomware groups, did more than $5 billion in transactions over its seven years of operation.\n\nBy comparison, Huione Guarantee, the Chinese-language, Telegram-based market used largely by crypto scammers, facilitated a stunning $27 billion in transactions from 2021 to 2025, according to Elliptic, dwarfing every online black market before it, even as it operated in full public view on Telegram’s messaging platform.

Many of its original members are in full-time roles at various government agencies, and the new National Design Studio (NDS) is headed by Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, a close ally of Musk’s.\n\nEven if DOGE doesn’t survive another year, or until the US semiquincentennial—its original expiration date, per the executive order establishing it—the organization’s larger project will continue. DOGE from its inception was used for two things, both of which have continued apace: the destruction of the administrative state and the wholesale consolidation of data in service of concentrating power in the executive branch. It is a pattern that experts say could spill over beyond the Trump administration.\n\n“I do think it has altered the norms about where legislative power ends and where executive power begins simply by ignoring those norms,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. “This is not necessarily going to be limited to Republican administrations. There are going to be future Democratic presidents who will say, ‘Well, DOGE was able to do this, why can't we?’”\n\nThe earliest days of DOGE were characterized by a chaotic blitz in which small teams of DOGE operatives, like the now infamous Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, were deployed across government agencies, demanding high-level access to sensitive data, firing workers, and cutting contracts. And while these moves were often radical, if not appearing to be illegal, as matters of bureaucratic operation, they were in service of what had been the Trump administration’s agenda all along.\n\nexpired: big balls tired: big balls wired: big balls Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nGoals like cutting discretionary spending and drastically reducing the size of the federal workforce had already been championed by people like vice president JD Vance, who in 2021 called for the “de-Ba’athification” of the government, and Russell Vought, now the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These goals were also part of Project 2025. What DOGE brought wasn’t the end, but the means—its unique insight was that controlling technical infrastructure, something achievable with a small group, functionally amounted to controlling the government.\n\n“There has never been a unit of government that was handed so much power to fundamentally upend government agencies with so little oversight,” says Moynihan.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the authority for establishing and funding federal agencies comes from Congress. But Trump and many of the people who support him, including Vought and Vance, adhere to what was until relatively recently a fringe view of how government should be run: the unitary executive theory. This posits that, much like the CEO of a company, the president has near complete control over the executive branch, of which federal agencies are a part—power more like that of a king than of the figure described in the nation’s founding documents.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:40.480201"}

But the firm is beefing up its cybersecurity with an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\"", "content": "Even as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulates AI agents to follow malicious instructions often hidden in web pages or emails, is a risk that’s not going away anytime soon — raising questions about how safely AI agents can operate on the open web.\n\n“Prompt injection, much like scams and social engineering on the web, is unlikely to ever be fully ‘solved,’” OpenAI wrote in a Monday blog post detailing how the firm is beefing up Atlas’ armor to combat the unceasing attacks. The company conceded that “agent mode” in ChatGPT Atlas “expands the security threat surface.”\n\nOpenAI launched its ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers rushed to publish their demos, showing it was possible to write a few words in Google Docs that were capable of changing the underlying browser’s behavior. That same day, Brave published a blog post explaining that indirect prompt injection is a systematic challenge for AI-powered browsers, including Perplexity’s Comet.\n\nOpenAI isn’t alone in recognizing that prompt-based injections aren’t going away. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. The U.K. government agency advised cyber professionals to reduce the risk and impact of prompt injections, rather than think the attacks can be “stopped.”\n\nFor OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.”\n\nThe company’s answer to this Sisyphean task? A proactive, rapid-response cycle that the firm says is showing early promise in helping discover novel attack strategies internally before they are exploited “in the wild.”\n\nThat’s not entirely different from what rivals like Anthropic and Google have been saying: that to fight against the persistent risk of prompt-based attacks, defenses must be layered and continuously stress-tested. Google’s recent work, for example, focuses on architectural and policy-level controls for agentic systems.\n\nBut where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent.\n\nThe bot can test the attack in simulation before using it for real, and the simulator shows how the target AI would think and what actions it would take if it saw the attack. The bot can then study that response, tweak the attack, and try again and again. That insight into the target AI’s internal reasoning is something outsiders don’t have access to, so, in theory, OpenAI’s bot should be able to find flaws faster than a real-world attacker would.\n\nIt’s a common tactic in AI safety testing: build an agent to find the edge cases and test against them rapidly in simulation.\n\n“Our [reinforcement learning]-trained attacker can steer an agent into executing sophisticated, long-horizon harmful workflows that unfold over tens (or even hundreds) of steps,” wrote OpenAI. “We also observed novel attack strategies that did not appear in our human red teaming campaign or external reports.”\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nIn a demo (pictured in part above), OpenAI showed how its automated attacker slipped a malicious email into a user’s inbox. When the AI agent later scanned the inbox, it followed the hidden instructions in the email and sent a resignation message instead of drafting an out-of-office reply. But following the security update, “agent mode” was able to successfully detect the prompt injection attempt and flag it to the user, according to the company.\n\nThe company says that while prompt injection is hard to secure against in a foolproof way, it’s leaning on large-scale testing and faster patch cycles to harden its systems before they show up in real-world attacks.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to share whether the update to Atlas’ security has resulted in a measurable reduction in successful injections, but says the firm has been working with third parties to harden Atlas against prompt injection since before launch.\n\nRami McCarthy, principal security researcher at cybersecurity firm Wiz, says that reinforcement learning is one way to continuously adapt to attacker behavior, but it’s only part of the picture.\n\n“A useful way to reason about risk in AI systems is autonomy multiplied by access,” McCarthy told TechCrunch.\n\n“Agentic browsers tend to sit in a challenging part of that space: moderate autonomy combined with very high access,” said McCarthy. “Many current recommendations reflect that trade-off. Limiting logged-in access primarily reduces exposure, while requiring review of confirmation requests constrains autonomy.”\n\nThose are two of OpenAI’s recommendations for users to reduce their own risk, and a spokesperson said Atlas is also trained to get user confirmation before sending messages or making payments. OpenAI also suggests that users give agents specific instructions, rather than providing them access to your inbox and telling them to “take whatever action is needed.”\n\n“Wide latitude makes it easier for hidden or malicious content to influence the agent, even when safeguards are in place,” per OpenAI.\n\nWhile OpenAI says protecting Atlas users against prompt injections is a top priority, McCarthy invites some skepticism as to the return on investment for risk-prone browsers.\n\n“For most everyday use cases, agentic browsers don’t yet deliver enough value to justify their current risk profile,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. “The risk is high given their access to sensitive data like email and payment information, even though that access is also what makes them powerful. That balance will evolve, but today the trade-offs are still very real.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:11:19 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:40.757908"}

Researchers have been studying the phenomenon for well over a decade, and they’ve developed a range of strategies to mitigate any problems.\n\nWind turbines present a unique challenge to radar operators.\n\n“The motion of a wind turbine gives it a complex Doppler signature,” Nicholas O’Donoughue, a senior engineer at the Rand Corporation, told TechCrunch.\n\nDoppler refers to the change in frequency of a wave like a radar signal caused by a moving object. As a wind turbine’s blades sweep through their arc, they are alternately moving toward and away from the radar station. The angle and speed of the blades can have an effect, too.\n\nThose, along with other considerations, can “challenge the detection of any targets that are near the wind farm,” O’Donoughue said.\n\nBut radar systems can filter out signals that result from wind farms. “The primary approach is to use adaptive processing algorithms, such as Space-Time Adaptive Processing, to learn the structure of a wind farm’s interference,” he said.\n\n“Over time, the reflections from a wind farm can be processed to look for patterns, which can then be matched and suppressed. This process is analogous to how modern adaptive noise cancellation headphones work, albeit more complicated.” Objects with a low radar cross section can still slip through, he noted.\n\nBecause of that, many wind farms are already built with radar installations in mind. “The most basic and widely employed mitigation method is wind farm siting, such as modifying the layout of a proposed wind farm to keep the wind turbines out of the line-of-sight of the radar,” the 2024 Energy department report said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:52:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:40.991369"}

It’s the latest move by Ellison’s son, David Ellison — the CEO of Paramount Skydance — to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” a Paramount press release published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount’s offer, but the elder Ellison’s “personal guarantee” is new, the press release states.\n\nThe revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount’s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was announced on December 5, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion.\n\nThree days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion, offering $30 per share. The WBD board rejected this offer, calling it “illusory” and claiming that Paramount had misled shareholders about the proposed deal’s financing. At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was “a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.”\n\nNow, Paramount’s amended offer has been designed to “address WBD’s stated concerns regarding Paramount’s superior offer,” Paramount said.

Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.\n\nAt its core, the Splay is a projector, meaning it can’t compete with high-end LCD-LED or OLED monitors. It costs $1,300; the device is currently sold out, but an Arovia representative told me that it will be restocked this month.\n\nHere’s how the device works, per one of Arovia’s patents\n\nThe … collapsible, portable display device, has a housing member having a sliding member aligned on the exterior of the housing member, and sliding along the exterior of said housing member between two operating positions, a collapsible screen containing one or more sheets of flexible, wrinkle resistant silicone or rubber materials containing optical enhancing components and capable of displaying an image when in an expanded operating position, and multiple collapsible members connected to said screen …\n\nArovia’s representative pointed to the Splay being used for mobile workspaces, gaming, and enterprise use cases, like trade shows.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:30:06 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:41.578541"}

His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA’s market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the successful debut of ULA’s Vulcan rocket, followed by struggles to ramp up the new rocket’s launch cadence.\n\nBruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin’s ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA’s leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.\n\nIn his first year, Bruno announced what would become the Vulcan rocket and the phaseout of ULA’s legacy Atlas and Delta launch vehicles. He also selected Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, then an emerging space company, to build the Vulcan rocket’s booster engines, bypassing the industry’s established propulsion contractor.\n\nThe decision to develop a new rocket and the selection of the engine to power it proved to be correct. The Atlas V rocket, now nearing retirement, is powered by Russian engines, a nonstarter in today’s geopolitical reality, and the already-retired Delta IV launch vehicle was prohibitively expensive. The Vulcan rocket has been successful in all three of its flights so far, and the performance of Blue Origin’s liquid-fueled BE-4 engine has, by all accounts, been exceptional.\n\nHard times at the rocket ranch\n\nBut ULA’s potential for regaining its position atop the launch market was hamstrung by the company’s decision to make the Vulcan rocket fully expendable. There are long-term plans to recover and reuse the rocket’s main engines, but not the entire booster. And the new rocket’s entry into service has not been smooth. The Vulcan rocket flew just once this year after receiving certification from the US Space Force to carry national security satellites into orbit, well short of Bruno’s goal of flying the new launcher up to 10 times.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 23:51:44 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:42.061462"}

A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA’s workforce.\n\nOn its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing’s Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.\n\nThe Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore lost his ability to control the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.\n\n“There was concern in real time that without recovery of some control, neither a docking nor a deorbit could be controllable, and that could have led to loss of vehicle and crew,” said Charlie Precourt, a former space shuttle commander and now a member of NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP). “Given the severity of this anomaly, NASA wisely and correctly used the safe haven of the ISS to conduct testing and engineering on the ground to analyze the various recovery options.”\n\nConfusion and uncertainty\n\nThroughout that summer, managers from NASA and Boeing repeatedly stated that the spacecraft was safe to bring Wilmore and Williams home if the station needed to be evacuated in an emergency.

Desperate samurai dispossessed by the restoration of the emperor enter into a deadly game for a life-changing cash prize — all for the entertainment of anonymous elites. Unlike its inspirations Battle Royale and Squid Game, however, Last Samurai Standing’s violence is chaotic, fast-paced, and kinetic, though it hides a careful choreography that makes the series a more electric proposition than its predecessors.\n\nViewers have Junichi Okada to thank for that. As well as starring in and producing Last Samurai Standing, he serves as the series’ action planner. Many will be familiar with the results of an action planner’s work — sometimes called an action director, elsewhere a “coordinator,” and even “choreographer” — though perhaps not what the role entails. In the case of Last Samurai Standing, it’s a role that touches on nearly every aspect of the production, from the story to the action itself.\n\n“I was involved from the script stage, thinking about what kind of action we wanted and how we would present it in the context of this story,” Okada tells The Verge. “If the director [Michihito Fujii] said, ‘I want to shoot this kind of battle scene,’ I would then think through the content and concept, design the scene, and ultimately translate that into script pages.”\n\nThe close relationship between the writer and director extends to other departments, too. Though an action planner’s role starts with managing fight scenes and stunt performers, they also liaise with camera, wardrobe, makeup, and even editorial departments to ensure fight scenes cohere with the rest of the production.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt’s a role which might appear a natural progression for Okada, who is certified to teach Kali and Jeet Kune Do — a martial art conceived by Bruce Lee — and holds multiple black belts in jiujitsu. Though the roots of his progression into action planning can be traced back further, to 1995 when he became the youngest member of J-pop group V6.\n\n“Dance experience connects directly to creating action,” he says. “[In both] rhythm and control of the body are extremely important.” Joining V6 at the age of 15, that experience has made Okada conscious of how he moves in relation to a camera during choreography, how he is seen within the structure of a shot, and, critical to action planning, how to navigate all of that safely from a young age.\n\nThat J-pop stardom also offered avenues into acting, initially in roles you might expect for a young pop star: comic heartthrobs and sitcom sons. But he was steadily able to broaden his output. A starring turn in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Hana followed, as did voice acting in Studio Ghibli’s Tales From Earthsea and From Up on Poppy Hill. A more telling departure was a starring role in 2007’s SP, in which he played a rookie in a police bodyguard unit, for which he trained for several years under shootfighting instructor Yorinaga Nakamura.\n\n“What I care about is whether audiences feel that ‘this man really lives here as a samurai.’”\n\nIn the years since, Okada has cemented himself as one of Japan’s most recognizable actors, hopping between action starring roles in The Fable to sweeping period epics like Sekigahara. Those two genres converge in his Last Samurai Standing role of Shujiro, a former Shogunate samurai now reduced to poverty, working through his PTSD and reckoning with his bloodthirsty past in the game. These days, it’s less of a concern that the character butts up against his past idol image, he suggests. “What I care about is whether audiences feel that ‘this man really lives here as a samurai.’”\n\nFor Okada’s work on Last Samurai Standing, as both producer and action planner, that involved lacing high-octane but believable action with the respect for history and character studies of the period dramas he loves. “Rather than being 100 percent faithful to historical accuracy,” he adds, “my goal was to focus on entertainment and story, while letting the ‘DNA’ and beauty of Japanese period drama gently float up in the background.”\n\nA focus on what he defines as “‘dō’ — movement,” pure entertainment that “never lets the audience get bored” punctuated — with “‘ma,’” the active emptiness that connects those frenetic moments. Both can be conversations, even if one uses words and another communicates dialogue through sword blows. This is most apparent when Shujiro faces his former comrade Sakura (Yasushi Fuchikami) inside a claustrophobic bank vault that serves as a charnel house for the game’s less fortunate contestants.\n\n“The whole battle is divided into three sequences,” Okada says. The first starts with a moment of almost perfect stillness, a deep breath, before the two launch into battle. “A fight where pride and mutual respect collide,” he says, “and where the speed of the techniques reaches a level that really surprises the audience.” It’s all captured in one, zooming take with fast, tightly choreographed action reminiscent of Donnie Yen and Wu Jing in Kill Zone.\n\nSo intense is their duel that both shatter multiple swords. The next phase sees them lash out in a more desperate and brutal manner with whatever weapons they find. Finally, having fought to a weary stalemate, the fight becomes, Okada concludes, “a kind of duel where their stubbornness and will are fully exposed” as they hack at each other with shattered blades and spear fragments.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt’s a rhythm that many fights in Last Samurai Standing follow, driven by a string of physical and emotional considerations that form the basis of an action planner’s tool kit: how and why someone fights based on who they are and their environment. Here it is two former samurai in an elegant and terrifyingly fast-paced duel. Elsewhere we see skill matched against brutality, or inexperience against expertise.\n\n“I define a clear concept for each sequence,” Okada says, before he opens those concepts up to the broader team. From there, he might add notes, but in Last Samurai Standing, action is a collaborative affair. “We keep refining,” he says. “It’s a back-and-forth process of shaping the sequence using both the ideas the team brings and the choreography I create myself.”\n\nThere is a third factor which Okada believes is the series’ most defining. “If we get to continue the story,” he says, “I’d love to explore how much more we can lean into ‘sei’ — stillness, and bring in even more of a classical period drama feel.”\n\nAs much of a triumph of action as Last Samurai Standing is, its quietest moments are the ones that stay with you. The charged looks between Shujiro and Iroha (Kaya Kiyohara) or their shuddering fright when confronted with specters of their past. Most of all, Shujiro watching his young ward, Futaba Katsuki (Yumia Fujisaki), dance before a waterlogged torii as mist hovers. These pauses are what elevate and invigorate the breathless action above spectacle.\n\nThe pauses are also emblematic of the balance that Last Samurai Standing strikes between its period setting and pushing the boundaries of action, all to inject new excitement into the genre. “Japan is a country that values tradition and everything it has built up over time. That’s why moments where you try to update things are always difficult,” Okada says. “But right now, we’re in the middle of that transformation.”\n\nThat is an evolution that Okada hopes to support through his work, both in front of and behind the camera. If he can create avenues for new generations of talent to carry Japanese media to a broader audience and his team to achieve greater success on a global stage, “that would make me very happy,” he says. “I want to keep doing whatever I can to help make that possible.”\n\nThe first season of Last Samurai Standing is streaming on Netflix now, and a second season was just confirmed.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T15:30:50.027059"}

It’s not clear how long the surveillance system has been public, but artifacts from the system show that its database was set up in September 2024, and traffic monitoring began in mid-2025.\n\nThe exposure offers a rare glimpse into how such national license plate surveillance systems work, the data they collect, and how they can be used to track the whereabouts of any one of the millions of people across an entire country.\n\nThe lapse also reveals the security and privacy risks associated with the mass monitoring of vehicles and their owners, at a time when the United States is building up its nationwide array of license plate readers, many of which are provided by surveillance giant Flock. Earlier this week, independent news outlet 404 Media reported that Flock left dozens of its own license plate reading cameras publicly exposed to the web, allowing a reporter to watch themselves being tracked in real time by a Flock camera.\n\nSen said he found the exposed Uzbek license plate surveillance system earlier this month, and shared details of the security lapse with TechCrunch. Sen told TechCrunch that the system’s database reveals the real-world locations of the cameras, and contains millions of photos and raw camera video footage of passing vehicles.\n\nThe system is run by the Department of Public Security in Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tashkent, which did not respond to emails requesting comment about the security lapse during December.\n\nRepresentatives of the Uzbek government in Washington D.C. and New York also did not respond to TechCrunch’s emails about the exposure. Uzbekistan’s computer emergency readiness team, UZCERT, did not respond to an alert about the system, except for an automated reply acknowledging receipt of our email.\n\nThe surveillance system remains exposed to the web at the time of writing.\n\nThe system refers to itself as an “intelligence traffic management system” by Maxvision, a Shenzhen, China-based maker of internet-connected traffic technologies, border inspection systems, and surveillance products. In a video on LinkedIn, the company says its cameras can record the “entire illegal process,” and can “display illegal and passing information in real-time.”\n\nAccording to its brochure, Maxvision exports its security and surveillance tech to countries across the globe, including Burkina Faso, Kuwait, Oman, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nTechCrunch’s analysis of the data inside the exposed system revealed at least a hundred cameras located across major Uzbek cities, as well as busy junctions and other important transit routes.\n\nWe plotted the GPS coordinates of the cameras, and found banks of license plate readers in Tashkent, the cities of Jizzakh and Qarshi in the south, and Namangan in the east. Some of the cameras are located in rural areas, such as on routes near the once-disputed parts of the borders between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot) Image Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nIn Tashkent, the country’s largest city, the cameras can be found at more than a dozen locations. Some of these cameras are even visible on Google Street View.\n\nThe cameras, some which watermark their footage with the name of the Singapore camera maker Holowits, capture video footage and still images of vehicles violating rules in 4K resolution.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nThe exposed system allows access to its web-based interface, which contains a dashboard allowing operators to examine footage of traffic violations. The dashboard contains zoomed-in photos and the raw video footage of violations, as well as surrounding vehicles. (TechCrunch redacted the license plates and vehicle occupants prior to publication.)\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nThe exposure of Uzbekistan’s national license plate reading system is the latest example of a security lapse involving road surveillance cameras.\n\nEarlier this year, Wired reported that more than 150 license plate readers around the United States and the real-time vehicle data they collect were exposed to the internet without any security.\n\nExposed license plate readers are not a new phenomena. In 2019, TechCrunch reported that over a hundred license plate readers were searchable and accessible from the internet, allowing anyone to access the data within.

Under the 2014–2025 rules, this was set at 18:1, but for 2026 onward, it has been reduced to 16:1.\n\nThis is measured at ambient temperature, though, not while the engine is running. A running engine is hotter—much hotter—than one sitting at ambient, and as metals heat up, they expand. The engines have very short throws, so it doesn’t take much expansion to increase the compression ratio by reducing the distance between the piston and cylinder head at the top of its travel. The benefit could be as much as 15 hp (11 kW), which translates to a few tenths of a second per lap advantage.\n\nUnfortunately for the other teams, the FIA stated that its rules indeed specify only that the compression ratio should be 16:1 based on static conditions and at ambient temperatures. “This procedure has remained unchanged despite the reduction in the permitted ratio for the 2026 season. It is true that thermal expansion can influence dimensions, but the current rules do not provide for measurements to be carried out at elevated temperatures,” the FIA said.\n\nSo if Mercedes and Red Bull do have a horsepower advantage, it’s one that will likely be baked into the 2026 season.\n\nThe compression ratio clarification wasn’t the only one issued by the FIA. For some time now, F1 has used ultrasonic fuel flow meters as a way to control power outputs. Under the outgoing regulations, this was capped at 100 kg/h, but with the move to fully sustainable synthetic fuels, this is changing to an energy cap of 3,000 MJ/h instead.\n\nIn the past, it had been theorized that teams could try to game the fuel flow meters—the most impressive idea I heard involved pulsing more fuel between the sensor’s sampling inputs to boost power, although I don’t believe it was ever implemented.\n\nDon’t even think about being that clever this time, the FIA says. “Any device, system, or procedure, the purpose of which is to change the temperature of the fuel-flow meter, is forbidden,” it says, updating the regulation that previously banned “intentional heating or chilling” of the fuel flow meter.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:25:38 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T15:30:50.936505"}

Lowpass is taking a winter break and will be back on January 8, 2026.\n\nAll I want for Christmas is to find that darn movie I’ve been meaning to watch. What was it called again? I could have sworn I bookmarked it somewhere…\n\nIf your household is anything like mine, you might frequently run into the same issue: There’s too much to watch out there, and keeping track of all the things you want to stream one day has become a nightmare. It’s not that there aren’t any tools for this. There are! And plenty of them! And they’re all easy to use! Which is kind of the problem.\n\nHere’s what usually happens: I may be browsing Netflix, logged into my profile, and bookmark a movie I want to check out in the future. Then, my wife takes over the remote, spends a bit of time clicking through Hulu, and adds a show she wants us to binge to the watch list associated with her profile. Or so we think — until we try to find it again and eventually discover that she was actually logged into our daughter’s profile and inadvertently added the show to her watch list.\n\nThen, the next day, we turn on the TV and see something fun on the homescreen. One quick button press, and it’s added to the watch list. Except, Google maintains this one, and it’s completely separate from all the other lists. Our family probably has about a dozen different watch lists. We don’t use them all actively, at least not when we’re in the mood to actually find something. But you can bet that there’s some really fun movie on our dog’s Tubi watch list (that my kids made), desperately waiting for us to finally remember where we bookmarked it.\n\nThere are apps that are trying to solve this very issue. Plex, for instance, has a pretty decent universal catalog of titles available across all the major streaming services and a watch list to remember your favorites. The app also does a good job deep-linking into third-party services, so you can jump directly to that Netflix show or movie rental on Amazon with one click. At least that’s true on mobile. On smart TVs, those deep links can be hit or miss, depending on the platform your TV is running. (Sorry, Roku users! You’re out of luck.)\n\nThe problem is that a universal watch list like this does require a lot more work on your part. When you browse Netflix at 11PM and stumble across something that looks interesting, you have to get your phone out, open the Plex app, search for that same title, and add it to the list. And when you finally get around to watch it, you’ll have to do the same thing all over again to remove the title from Plex’s list. That’s a lot of work for a little late-night TV.\n\nThe sad truth is that watch lists, as well-intended as they were, are broken. Here’s how streaming services and smart TV platforms could fix them: Instead of keeping all watch-list data in a silo, these services should enable consumers to opt into sharing it between services. That way, if I bookmark a movie on Netflix, the Netflix app shares that information with my Plex watch list. Once I watch it, it disappears from both lists again. And when my wife adds a Hulu show to our Google TV watch list, it immediately populates in our Hulu watch list as well.\n\nIdeally, I’d want to have a bunch of different ways to enter this kind of data and just as many ways to consume it. Maybe I’d keep one master list maintained by Plex, Google, or another company. But I’d also want to be able to keep smashing that bookmark button in whatever streaming app I’m in and have all my lists across all providers update in real time. Granted, Netflix may never list titles that are only available on Hulu. But these days, shows regularly move from one service to another. What if Netflix internally made a note of shows I bookmarked on HBO Max and then added them to my Netflix watch list when those HBO shows eventually found their way to its service?\n\nOnce you have enough data flowing back and forth between streaming apps and watch lists, you may also be less dependent on profiles, which were always an imperfect solution. Sure, my wife and I may like different things on occasion. But most of the time, we watch TV together. So why not automatically sort our bookmarked shows and movies by genre, mood, and age rating, instead of siloing them in watch lists associated with individual profiles?\n\nFederating watch lists, and liberating movie and TV show bookmarks from those silos, could also allow for a whole range of neat new use cases that simply aren’t possible today. What if, for instance, Spotify automatically generated playlists of the soundtracks of movies and shows you recently watched, based on the data of titles disappearing from your watch list? (Hat tip to J Herskowitz for this one.)\n\nUnfortunately, streaming services are incredibly protective of their data. Companies like Netflix want you to spend all your time within their app and not with a third-party aggregator that might recommend titles from Hulu’s catalog based on your Netflix viewing history. In fact, Netflix is so protective of its in-app experience, and its own watch list, that it doesn’t allow Google TV users to add Netflix titles to their smart TV’s universal watch list. And none of the major streaming services, with Plex being the one notable exception, offers an RSS feed of your watch list.\n\nBut this time of the year, I can’t help but hope for miracles. Perhaps, there’s a streaming executive out there right now, still looking for a New Year’s resolution. Here’s a great one: Open the floodgates. Free the data. Let people remix it, build interesting hacks. Ingest as much data as possible from other services, and use it to help everyone find the perfect movie or show without having to scour a thousand lists.\n\nUntil that happens, I might just crack open a book. Now, if I could only remember what I wanted to read next…", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T11:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:13.192349"}

The landmark bill is called [&#8230;]", "content": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nA group of tech companies and academic institutions spent tens of thousands of dollars in the past month — likely between $17,000 and $25,000 — on an ad campaign against New York’s landmark AI safety bill, which may have reached more than two million people, according to Meta’s Ad Library.\n\nThe landmark bill is called the RAISE Act, or the Responsible AI Safety and Education Act, and days ago, a version of it was signed by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. The closely watched law dictates that AI companies developing large models — OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, DeepSeek, etc. — must outline safety plans and transparency rules for reporting large-scale safety incidents to the attorney general. But the version Hochul signed — different than the one passed in both the New York State Senate and the Assembly in June — was a rewrite that made it much more favorable to tech companies. A group of more than 150 parents had sent the governor a letter urging her to sign the bill without changes. And the group of tech companies and academic institutions, called the AI Alliance, were part of the charge to defang it.\n\nThe AI Alliance — the organization behind the opposition ad campaign — counts Meta, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Snowflake, Uber, AMD, Databricks, and Hugging Face among its members, which is not necessarily surprising. The group sent a letter in June to New York lawmakers about its “deep concern” about the bill and deemed it “unworkable.” But the group isn’t just made up of tech companies. Its members include a number of colleges and universities all around the world, including New York University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Notre Dame, as well as Penn Engineering and Yale Engineering.\n\nThe ads began on November 23 and ran with the title, “The RAISE Act will stifle job growth.” They said that the legislation “would slow down the New York technology ecosystem powering 400,000 high-tech jobs and major investments. Rather than stifling innovation, let’s champion a future where AI development is open, trustworthy, and strengthens the Empire State.”\n\nWhen The Verge asked the academic institutions listed above whether they were aware they had been inadvertently part of an ad campaign against widely discussed AI safety legislation, none responded to a request for comment, besides Northeastern, which did not provide a comment by publication time. In recent years, OpenAI and its competitors have increasingly been courting academic institutions to be part of research consortiums or offering technology directly to students for free.\n\nMany of the academic institutions that are part of the AI Alliance aren’t directly involved in one-on-one partnerships with AI companies, but some are. For instance, Northeastern’s partnership with Anthropic this year translated to Claude access for 50,000 students, faculty, and staff across 13 global campuses, per Anthropic’s announcement in April. In 2023, OpenAI funded a journalism ethics initiative at NYU. Dartmouth announced a partnership with Anthropic earlier this month, a Carnegie Mellon University professor currently serves on OpenAI’s board, and Anthropic has funded programs at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nThe initial version of the RAISE Act stated that developers must not release a frontier model “if doing so would create an unreasonable risk of critical harm,” which the bill defines as the death or serious injury of 100 people or more, or $1 billion or more in damages to rights in money or property stemming from the creation of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon. That definition also extends to an AI model that “acts with no meaningful human intervention” and “would, if committed by a human,” fall under certain crimes. The version Hochul signed removed this clause. Hochul also increased the deadline for disclosure for safety incidents and lessened fines, among other changes.\n\nThe AI Alliance has lobbied previously against AI safety policies, including the RAISE Act, California’s SB 1047, and President Biden’s AI executive order. It states that its mission is to “bring together builders and experts from various fields to collaboratively and transparently address the challenges of generative AI and democratize its benefits,” especially via “member-driven working groups.” Some of the group’s projects beyond lobbying have involved cataloguing and managing “trustworthy” datasets and creating a ranked list of AI safety priorities.\n\nThe AI Alliance wasn’t the only organization opposing the RAISE Act with ad dollars. As The Verge wrote recently, Leading the Future, a pro-AI super PAC backed by Perplexity AI, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale, and OpenAI president Greg Brockman, has spent money on ads targeting the cosponsor of the RAISE Act, New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores. But Leading the Future is a super PAC with a clear agenda, whereas the AI Alliance is a nonprofit that’s partnered with a trade association — with the mission of “developing AI collaboratively, transparently, and with a focus on safety, ethics, and the greater good.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T11:18:49-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:13.386538"}

Its clever design adds layers of extra functionality, and the inclusion of a retractable two-way charging cable expands the number of devices you can charge without always having to remember to pack a cord. It also improves your smartphone’s ergonomics when taking photos, but that’s one of a few places where the PowerGrip’s functionality feels disappointingly limited.\n\nThe PowerGrip is much chunkier and heavier than I expected, which turned out not to be a bad thing. At 272 grams, most of the PowerGrip’s weight comes from its 9,300mAh battery, but I wouldn’t opt for anything smaller because I like knowing I’ve got enough power to fully recharge my iPhone with headroom to top off other devices like my watch and earbuds.\n\nThere are lighter wireless power banks available with more capacity, but the PowerGrip’s heft has some benefits. Most consumers will buy the accessory to make their smartphone feel more like a digital camera, and the PowerGrip mostly delivers. It attaches to the back of any Qi2, MagSafe, or Pixelsnap-compatible smartphone. The magnetic connection feels secure but doesn’t feel quite as strong as the PopSocket I regularly use. I’m not worried my iPhone is going to fall off on its own, but accidentally bumping my phone while I’m only holding the PowerGrip could send my device tumbling.\n\nThe protruding grip is sizable and makes your phone feel like a sturdy DSLR. I’ve never found a comfortable one-handed way to shoot with my iPhone that also feels secure, but it’s easy with the PowerGrip, and its weight adds some welcome stability that usually requires two hands.\n\nThe PowerGrip can stand on its edge and be used as a hands-free smartphone stand. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nThe design allows the PowerGrip to stand on its edge and function as a smartphone stand. You can attach your phone and make hands-free recordings or video calls, or take advantage of iOS’ StandBy mode on your bedside table. It’s functionality I never intended to use, but have found myself using quite frequently.\n\nThe PowerGrip’s shutter button is a little thin for my liking. I prefer round buttons and having them positioned on top of a camera grip. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nThe PowerGrip has a dedicated shutter button that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth. Pressing it once snaps a photo, while holding it down triggers a video recording until released. I would prefer the button positioned at the top of the grip instead of its front edge. I also frequently found myself missing the additional settings dials on my Sony mirrorless camera that are conveniently located within thumb’s reach.\n\nThere are no other camera controls on the PowerGrip, and when using it one-handed you may struggle to reach useful functions on your phone with your thumb. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nThere are other smartphone camera grips, like the Fjorden Pro and the magnetic Leica Lux Grip, that feature more controls, including customizable dials and two-stage shutter buttons for controlling focus. They’re both considerably more expensive than the $80 PowerGrip, and those added controls only work with third-party camera apps, so I understand Belkin’s decision not to take that approach. But with the PowerGrip attached and hanging a half-inch off the bottom of my iPhone 16 Pro, my thumb struggled to reach the onscreen controls in the iOS camera app without awkwardly adjusting my grip. More often than not, one-handed shooting still required screen taps from my other hand, which I found frustrating.\n\nBuilt-in retractable charging cables are becoming more common with power banks, and the PowerGrip’s can be used to charge itself or other devices. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nEven more frustrating is the PowerGrip’s power output. Wireless charging rates are limited to just 7.5W, which feels glacial when Belkin has already implemented faster 25W Qi2.2 rates on other chargers. It takes hours to fully charge my iPhone, and it’s not much faster switching to a cable. The PowerGrip has an additional USB-C port and a built-in 30-inch USB-C charging cable. Belkin says the power output maxes out at 15W, but I measured a little over 18W while charging a OnePlus 12 with Plugable’s USB-C voltage meter. However, that output is shared when charging three devices simultaneously. Charging rates for the OnePlus 12 dropped to less than 5W while also wirelessly charging my iPhone and a Kobo e-reader using the retractable cable.\n\nA small but very bright screen on the front of the PowerGrip shows its remaining charge level and when it’s being used to charge other devices. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nCompared to more expensive camera grip accessories like the $395 Leica Lux Grip or the $149.95 ShiftCam ProGrip that only feature batteries to power themselves, it’s understandable that Belkin had to settle for some compromises to get its Stage PowerGrip on shelves for $79.99. You’ll just want to really take those compromises into consideration when deciding if it’s worth it for you. If you like a lot of functionality in one accessory, it’s worth considering. If you want more charging performance or a grip with more photography-focused functionality, you’ll be better off juggling multiple accessories.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T11:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:13.803758"}

Digital avatar generation company Lemon Slice is working to add a video layer to those chats with a new diffusion model that can create digital avatars from a single image.\n\nCalled Lemon Slice-2, the model can create a digital avatar that works on top of a knowledge base to play any role required of the AI agent, like addressing customer queries, helping with homework questions, or even working as a mental health support agent.\n\n“In the early days of GenAI, my co-founders started to play around with different video models, and it became obvious to us that video was going to be interactive. The compelling part about tools like ChatGPT was that they were interactive, and we want video to have that layer,” co-founder Lina Colucci said.\n\nLemon Slice says this is a 20-billion-parameter model that can work on a single GPU to live-stream videos at 20 frames per second. The company is making the model available through an API and an embeddable widget that companies can integrate into their sites with a single line of code. After an avatar is created, you can change the background, styling, and appearance of a character at any point.\n\nBesides human-like avatars, the company is also focusing on being able to generate non-human characters to suit different needs. The startup is using ElevenLabs’ tech to generate the voices of these avatars.\n\nFounded by Lina Colucci, Sidney Primas, and Andrew Weitz in 2024, Lemon Slice is betting that using its own general-purpose diffusion model (a type of generative model that learns to work backwards from noisy training data to generate new data) for making avatars will set it apart from competitors.\n\n“The existing avatar solutions I’ve seen to date add negative value to the product,” Colucci said. “They are creepy, and they are stiff. They look good for a few seconds, and as soon as you start interacting with them, it feels very uncanny, and it doesn’t put you at ease. The thing that has prevented avatars from really taking off is that they haven’t been good enough.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nTo fund that effort, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $10.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Dropbox CTO Arash Ferdowsi, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, and The Chainsmokers.\n\nThe company says it has guardrails in place to prevent unauthorized face or voice cloning, and that it uses large language models for content moderation.\n\nLemon Slice would not name the organizations using its technology, but said the model is being put to work for use cases like education, language learning, e-commerce, and corporate training.\n\nThe startup faces stiff competition from video generation startups like D-ID, HeyGen, and Sythesia, as well as other digital avatar makers Genies, Soul Machine, Praktika, and AvatarOS.\n\nIlya Sukhar, a partner at Matrix, thinks that avatars will be useful in areas where videos are prominent. For instance, people like learning from YouTube rather than reading long blocks of text. He noted that Lemon Slice’s technical prowess and its own will give it an edge over other startups.\n\n“It’s a deeply technical team with a track record of shipping ML products, not just demos and research. Many of the other players are bespoke to particular scenarios or verticals, and Lemon Slice is taking the generalized ‘bitter lesson’ scaling approach (of data and compute) that has worked in other AI modalities,” he said.\n\nY-Combinator’s Jared Friedman believes that using a diffusion-style model allows Lemon Slice to generate any kind of avatars as compared to some other startups that are focused on either human-like or game character-like avatars.\n\n“Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test. They train the same type of model as Veo3 or Sora: a video diffusion transformer. Because it is a general-purpose model that does the whole thing end-to-end, it has no ceiling on how good it can get; the others top out below photorealistic. It also works for both human and non-human faces and requires only an image to add a new face,” he said.\n\nThe startup currently has eight employees, and plans to use the funds to hire engineering and go-to-market staff, along with paying the compute bills to train its models.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:15.088958"}

His dad built homes for major developers, and his mom sold to big-box builders across the East Coast.\n\nDonahue was particularly interested in why designing a custom home cost a fortune and took forever, and why most people had to settle for whatever the developers were offering that year. So when he dropped out of NC State and moved to the Bay Area, he eventually did what you might expect a college drop-out to do in San Francisco: he started a company to fix it.\n\nThat effort, Atmos, went through Y Combinator, raised $20 million from investors like Khosla Ventures and Sam Altman, and tried to use tech to streamline the custom home design process. It had designers on staff who worked with clients while software handled the back-end. It grew to 40 people and $7 million in revenue, and they designed $200 million worth of houses, and built 50.\n\nAll that sounds great until you hear Donahue describe it. “It became this extremely operational business,” he told me on a Zoom call last week. “Kind of like a glamorized architecture firm.”\n\nIt never quite replaced the humans, in other words. Then the Federal Reserve started jacking up interest rates, and suddenly clients who’d spent months designing their dream homes couldn’t afford them anymore. Nine months ago, Donahue shut it down.\n\nHere’s where most founders would take a break, maybe write a few LinkedIn posts about what they learned. Instead, Donahue regrouped and started another company.\n\nDrafted is now nearly five months old, and it’s everything Atmos wasn’t. No designers on staff. No operational complexity. Just AI-driven software that generates residential floor plans and exterior designs in minutes. You tell it what you want – bedrooms, square footage, whatever – and it spits out five designs. Don’t like them? You can generate five more and keep going until something clicks.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nRight now, Drafted has six employees, four from Atmos, and it’s raised $1.65 million at a $35 million post-money valuation from Bill Clerico, Stripe’s Patrick Collison, Jack Altman, Josh Buckley, and Warriors player Moses Moody.\n\nClerico led the round because he’d also been an angel investor in Atmos, and had watched Donahue will houses into existence despite rising interest rates. When Donahue told him about the new company over coffee, Clerico didn’t need convincing. “Nick, please take our money,” he apparently said repeatedly over a two week period until Donahue agreed.\n\nThe pitch is straightforward. Right now, if you want a custom home, you’ve got two options: hire an architect (expensive, slow), or buy a template plan online (cheap, inflexible). Drafted sits in the middle, offering customization at template prices. A complete plan costs between $1,000 and $2,000.\n\nThe economics work because Drafted built its own AI model, trained on real house plans from homes that were built and passed permitting. Practical constraints are considered, and Donahue says the specialized model costs almost nothing to run: two-tenths of a penny per floor plan, compared to 13 cents for general-purpose AI.\n\nDrafted only does single-story homes right now, but multi-story and lot-specific features are coming. The bigger question is whether there’s actually a market for this.\n\nThe numbers aren’t huge. Of the million new homes built in America each year, only 300,000 are custom designed. Most people buy existing homes or pick from whatever tract homes the big builders are offering.\n\nClerico’s argument is that this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Make custom design cheap and fast enough, and many more people will do it. Donahue compares it to Uber, which didn’t just replace taxis but made on-demand car service something that nearly everyone uses. “There’s really no reason in the future why everyone shouldn’t have a totally custom designed home,” Clerico says.\n\nOr maybe most Americans will keep being price-conscious buyers who take what’s available. The housing market has a long track record of rebuffing disruption.\n\nThere’s also the “moat” question. Asked what’s to keep an LLM player or even another vertical player from buying similar data sets and creating the same product, Donahue talks about brand, pointing to his friend David Holz, who founded the video and image generating AI outfit, Midjourney. Despite the plethora of new image-generation models being launched, Midjourney’s usage barely moves, Holz has told Donahue; its customers keep coming back to make AI images.\n\nSimilarly, Donahue thinks if they move fast enough and please enough customers, Drafted can become the place for people to design houses.\n\nTime will tell. Since opening to the public, the outfit has begun seeing about 1,000 daily users. Not huge numbers, but they show steady growth for such a young product.\n\nIn the meantime, Donahue has something pretty valuable that could give Drafted an edge: deep knowledge of a problem and the insights gleaned from taking a crack at it once already.\n\nPictured above, the Drafted crew, left to right: Martynas Pocius, Albert Chiu, Martina Cheru, Carson Poole, Stephen Chou, and Nick Donahue", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:32:01.750296"}

The Rutgers MSA was one of dozens of organizations infiltrated by the NYPD, according to an Associated Press investigation in 2011 that relied on leaked documents outlining the infiltration operations. Following rounds of negative publicity and a civil rights suit that was settled in 2018, the NYPD “demographics unit” was disbanded. Hashmi did not sign on to the settlement and lost his original open-records case in 2018, when a 4-3 Court of Appeals decision affirmed the NYPD’s ability to use a “Glomar” response to his request for documents about the mosque-raking program, neither confirming nor denying the existence of such records.\n\nHashmi filed a new set of record requests under the New York Freedom of Information Law in February asking for a narrower set of records than his previous request—weekly intelligence summaries, profiles of specific organizations targeted by the Intelligence Division, and reports on particular mosques—pertaining to community and religious organizations he participated in from 2006 through 2008. His petition, filed in December after the NYPD rejected his FOIL and subsequent appeal, cites specific intelligence reports from that period published 14 years ago by the Associated Press.\n\nIn an interview, Hashmi told WIRED he was motivated by the loss of his father as well as his co-plaintiff in his original suit, Harlem Imam Talib Abdur-Rashid (who passed away in November 2025), to take a second crack at uncovering the truth about the NYPD’s spying operations targeting Arab and Muslim organizations and communities in New York City, the surrounding states, and elsewhere in the United States.\n\nA firm supporter of Mamdani, Hashmi said he restarted his research into the Intelligence Division’s activities in New York and the surrounding areas in 2023, prompted by the NYPD’s violent crackdown on a series of protests in the past three years that are now the subject of a pair of lawsuits alleging rampant First and Fourteenth Amendment violations. However, it was Mamdani’s decision to retain Jessica Tisch as police commissioner shortly after his election victory that pushed Hashmi into action.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:53:52.651063"}

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.\n\nA federal judge blocked a Texas law requiring mobile app stores to verify users’ ages from taking effect on January 1st.\n\nIn an order granting a preliminary injunction on the Texas App Store Accountability Act (SB 2420), Judge Robert Pitman wrote that the statute “is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book.” Pitman has not yet ruled on the merits of the case, but his decision to grant the preliminary injunction means he believes its defenders are unlikely to prevail in court.\n\nThe Texas App Store Accountability Act is the first among a series of similar state laws to face a legal challenge, making the ruling especially significant, as Congress considers a version of the statute. The laws, versions of which also passed in Utah and Louisiana, aim to impose age verification standards at the app store level, making companies like Apple and Google responsible for transmitting signals about users’ ages to app developers to block users from age-inappropriate experiences. While the format has been developed and championed by parent advocates, it’s gotten a boost from lobbying by Meta and other tech platforms that support the model, like Snap and X.\n\nThe Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), whose members include Apple, Google, and Meta, sued to block the law from taking effect, saying it “imposes a broad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps.” The group claims that the Texas law would impose steep burdens on teens’ ability to access speech online, requiring them and their parents to give up information in order to access various apps. A student advocacy group separately sued to block the law, arguing it unconstitutionally limits speech that kids can be exposed to. The state has maintained that the law is constitutional and should be upheld.\n\nThe state can still appeal the ruling with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has a history of reversing blocks on internet regulations. Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling and on its plans to appeal.\n\n“[H]owever widespread the agreement that the issue must be addressed, the Court remains bound by the rule of law”\n\nPitman found that the highest level of scrutiny must be applied to evaluate the law under the First Amendment, which means the state must prove the law is “the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.” The judge found this is not the case and that it wouldn’t even survive intermediate scrutiny, because Texas has so far failed to prove that its goals are connected to its methods.\n\nSince Texas already has a law requiring age verification for porn sites, Pitman said that “only in the vast minority of applications would SB 2420 have a constitutional application to unprotected speech not addressed by other laws.” Though Pitman acknowledged the importance of safeguarding kids online, he added, “the means to achieve that end must be consistent with the First Amendment. However compelling the policy concerns, and however widespread the agreement that the issue must be addressed, the Court remains bound by the rule of law.”\n\nApple has opposed Texas’ approach to app store age verification, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly going as far as calling Governor Greg Abbott to try to dissuade him from signing the law. Google has also opposed it, but has come around to a different model of app store age assurance recently passed in California, which would require less data collection.\n\nRecently, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee advanced two versions of app store age-gating bills that borrow aspects from the Texas and California versions. The effort to expand the proposal nationally has alarmed Apple, with Cook meeting with committee leaders the day before the markup to discuss the bills.\n\nAs age verification proposals targeting app stores have moved forward in states and Congress, however, the companies that run them also seem to be responding to the growing regulatory threat with preemptive changes. Apple, for example, announced new kids safety features this year that included a way for parents to share their kids’ age ranges with app developers.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T13:15:49-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:29.433194"}

Just as there have been remarkable advances in weather forecasting with the use of large language models, so will there be for determining an individual’s risk of the major age-related diseases (cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative). These diseases share common threads, such as a long incubation phase before any symptoms are manifest, usually two decades or more. They also have the same biologic underpinnings of immunosenescence and inflammaging, terms that characterize an immune system that has lost some of its functionality and protective power, and the accompanying heightened inflammation.\n\nThe science of aging has given us new ways to track these processes with body-wide and organ clocks, along with specific protein biomarkers. That enables us to determine whether a person or an organ within a person is aging at an accelerated pace. Along with that, new AI algorithms can see things that medical experts cannot, such as accurately interpreting medical images like retinal scans to predict cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases many years in advance.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.\n\nThese added layers of data can be combined with a person’s electronic medical records, which include their structured and unstructured notes, lab results, scans, genetic results, wearable sensors, and environmental data. In aggregate, this provides an unprecedented depth of information about the person’s health status, enabling a forecast for risk of the three major diseases. Unlike a polygenic risk score which can detect a person’s risk for heart disease, the common cancers and Alzheimer’s, precision medical forecasting takes it to a new level by providing the projected temporal arc—the “when” factor. When all of the data is analyzed with large reasoning models, it can provide a person’s vulnerabilities, and an individualized, aggressive preventive program.\n\nWe already know the risk of these three diseases can be reduced with lifestyle factors, such as an optimal anti-inflammatory diet, frequent exercise, and a regular, high-quality sleep pattern. But, along with attention to these factors, which are far more likely to be implemented when an individual is cognizant of their risk, we will have medications that will promote a healthy, protective immune system and reduce body-wide and brain inflammation. Already the GLP-1 medicines have been shown to be a front-runner for achieving these goals, but many more medications are in the pipeline.\n\nThe potential for precision medical forecasting has to be demonstrated and validated via prospective clinical trials that show, using the same metrics of aging, that a person’s risk is decreased. An example for people with increased risk of Alzheimer’s is the blood test known as p-tau217, and that risk can be markedly reduced with improved lifestyle factors, especially exercise. That could be confirmed with a brain organ clock and body-wide aging clocks.\n\nThis is a new frontier in medicine—the potential for primary prevention of the three age-related major diseases that compromise our health span and quality of life. It would not be possible without the advances in both the science of aging and AI. For me, this is the most exciting future use of AI in medicine: an unparalleled opportunity to prevent the major diseases from occurring, something that has been dreamed about but has not been possible at scale due to the deficiency in data and analytics.

We’ve seen a few other 6K monitors from Asus, Dell, and LG, though they don’t come with the Odyssey’s 3D effects or a focus on gaming. For now, select games like Stellar Blade, Lies of P: Overture, and The First Berserker: Khazan are optimized specifically for the Odyssey 3D, but several other titles still support its 3D effects, including Black Myth: Wukong, Hogwarts Legacy, Palworld, and Silent Hill 2.\n\nSamsung is launching five new Odyssey monitors next year. Image: Samsung\n\nA 6K 3D display isn’t the only notable upgrade coming to Samsung’s lineup; the company is launching the Odyssey G6 G60H, which it says is the “world’s first” 1,040Hz gaming monitor. The 27-inch monitor only supports this ultra-fast refresh rate in HD, while its native 1440p resolution still offers speeds up to a very fast 600Hz. It’s also compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync.\n\nSamsung has also revealed three new Odyssey G8 monitors, with the 32-inch G80HS offering a 6K resolution with refresh rates up to 165Hz (or 330Hz refresh rate at 3K), as well as a 27-inch 5K G80HF model with speeds up to 180Hz (or 360Hz at 1440p). There’s an Odyssey G8 with a 4K OLED display, too, featuring an up to 240Hz refresh rate, 300-nit brightness, and True Black 500 certification for deeper blacks. All three models support AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync.\n\nSamsung hasn’t yet revealed the pricing or release date of any of these models, but the Odyssey 3D is bound to be a bit pricey, given the $2,000 price tag attached to Samsung’s 4K 3D screen.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T14:13:50-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:26:28.784484"}

The voluntary recall of its software affected 332 vehicles, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nWhile there have not been any collisions associated with the issue, Zoox noted in the NHTSA filing that it could increase the risk of a crash. The company provides free rides to the public in its driverless Zoox vehicles in parts of San Francisco and Las Vegas.\n\nA Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch the company identified some instances in which its vehicles made maneuvers that, while common for human drivers, didn’t meet its standards. For example, in an effort to avoid blocking certain intersections at a red light, the robotaxi might stop in a crosswalk. In other instances, the robotaxi made a late turn, resulting in a wide turn, according to a spokesperson’s emailed statement.\n\nThe issue was initially identified on August 26 when a Zoox robotaxi made a wide right turn, crossed partially into the opposing travel lane, and temporarily stopped in front of the oncoming travel lane, according to the NHTSA filing.\n\nZoox monitored its data for additional lane crossings near intersections, ultimately identifying 62 instances between August 26 and December 5. The company said in the filing was in “ongoing conversations with NHTSA about the frequency, severity, and root causes of these occurrences.”\n\nThe company updated its software on November 7 and again in mid-December to address all of the issues.\n\n“We have successfully identified and deployed targeted software improvements to address the root causes of these incidents,” the statement reads. “Today, we’re submitting a voluntary software recall because transparency and safety is foundational to Zoox, and we want to be open with the public and regulators about how we are constantly refining and improving our technology.”\n\nThe software recall affected Zoox vehicles operating on public roads between March 13 and December 18, according to the filing.\n\nZoox has issued several software recalls this year, including one in March to address unexpected hard braking.

Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for Avengers: Doomsday as previews prior to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter.\n\nSo maybe you’ve seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer.\n\nAs previously reported, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (The Kang Dynasty) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.\n\nRather than keeping Kang as the villain and recasting the character, the Russo brothers decided to take a new direction: bringing the Secret Wars storyline to the big screen. It’s one of their favorites but before they could take on Avengers: Secret Wars (slated for May 2027), the duo knew they first had to make Avengers: Doomsday, featuring the wildly popular comics villain Doctor Doom, featuring the return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU in that role.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:45:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:55:13.332248"}

Unlimited cell phone plans often come with a long list of footnotes, terms, conditions, and exceptions. Mercifully, all of the Big Three cell companies have, by now, ditched throttling on their highest-paid tiers, and include 5G data access in all their unlimited plans. Yet there are still many differences in the services they offer, and from tier to tier within each company.\n\nCheaper “unlimited” tiers do offer unlimited talk and text. But they still have rules on how much unlimited data you get before they start throttling your speed, and some “unlimited” plans may throttle your data at any given time. Data throttling is the practice of reducing your data speeds after you hit a certain threshold of data used in a month or during times of congestion. It's been a fixture of cell service plans for years.\n\nBelow, I've highlighted what each of the major carriers offers for “unlimited” individual and family plans to help you figure out which unlimited plan is best for you and your budget.\n\nThe Best Unlimited Plan Right Now: T-Mobile Experience More\n\nT-Mobile Essentials, Experience More, and Experience Beyond Plans\n\nThe Essentials plan (with autopay, taxes/fees not included): 1 Line for $60/month | 2 Lines $90 | 3 Lines $90 | 4 Lines $100 | 5 Lines $125\n\nExperience More (with autopay, taxes/fees not included): 1 Line for $85/month | 2 Lines $140 | 3 Lines $140 | 4 Lines $170 | 5 Lines $200\n\nExperience Beyond (with autopay, taxes/fees not included): 1 Line for $100/month | 2 Lines $170 | 3 Lines $170 | 4 Lines $215 | 5 Lines $260\n\nT-Mobile has the best 5G coverage among the big three, the highest 5G speeds, the fastest downloads and the best overall reliability, according to analysis from OpenSignal and Ookla. The carrier also makes claims to winning on value, when you take into account perks that include entertainment bundles, airplane WiFi, and access to satellite data in emergencies.\n\nT-Mobile has rebranded its unlimited offerings this year but still offers three unlimited talk and text plans: Essentials, Experience More, and Experience Beyond. Only the two Experience plans offer true unlimited 5G data without any throttling or deprioritizing (i.e., making your phone stand in line for data behind other, more important, phones during peak demand.)\n\nIf cost is more important to you than perks, and you don't travel a lot internationally, the Essentials plan is what we recommend for people with big families. It's no frills, just the phone, ma'am, with no subscription money going to streaming services or international carrier fees. Your hotspot is limited to 3G speeds if you're a laptop warrior, an important consideration for many, and video streaming is 480p. But at its price point, Essentials is the only plan to offer premium data (up to 50 GB) that won't be throttled. If youy've got home WiFi, that 50GB should be sufficient for most people. Besides, it'll teach your teens how to budget, and how to ask for the WiFi password instead of using their own data.

With I Love LA, Sennott is in charge as the creator, writer, and star of this LA-set Hollywood comedy. Maia (Sennott) is an aspiring talent manager who, on her 27th birthday, manages to gather the courage to ask her boss Alyssa (Leighton Meester) for a promotion. While the answer is no, Maia tells her friends and boyfriend (Josh Hutcherson) otherwise, then hatches a plan to take her career to the next level with the help of her friends.\n\nThe Seduction\n\nMarquise de Merteuil (Anamaria Vartolomei) is ready for payback after having her heart broken—and humiliated—by Vicomte de Valmont (Vincent Lacoste), aka Valmont. So she sets about becoming Paris’ premier courtesan. HBO’s new French language period drama is a sexy, sumptuous series that serves as a prequel to Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ Les Liaisons Dangereuses.\n\nIt: Welcome to Derry\n\nIt director Andy Muschietti returns to the place where Stephen King’s clown killer was born in this ’60s-set prequel series that doles out Pennywise’s origins in hour-long doses. Bill Skarsgård is also back as both the sewer-dwelling horror icon and an executive producer on the show, which mixes the terror that fans have come to expect from the movies with well-executed period details. All of which amounts to an unexpected take on the genre—and one that should have coulrophobes running for the door.\n\nThe Chair Company\n\nI Think You Should Leave cocreators Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin have teamed up yet again to showcase their brilliantly unhinged brand of comedy. In this case, Robinson stars as Ron Trosper, a father, husband, and regular corporate wonk who suffers a very public embarrassment at work. Rather than brush it off, Trosper becomes convinced that he’s a victim and eventually finds himself caught up in a truly bizarre conspiracy theory. The less you know going in the better. But if you’re a fan of the wildly uncomfortable characters Robinson is known for, The Chair Company takes it to the next level.\n\nTask\n\nMare of Easttown creator Brad Ingelsby returns to HBO with a new crime-drama miniseries, this time swapping out Oscar winner Kate Winslet for Oscar winner Mark Ruffalo. Here the Hulk actor plays Tom Brandis, a Catholic priest turned FBI agent who is reeling from a family tragedy. But duty calls, and Brandis has a job to do, which ultimately sees his life colliding with that of Robbie Prendergrast (Ozark’s Tom Pelphrey), a trash collector by day who spends his nights robbing a local drug gang’s trap houses in the Philly suburbs. Like Mare of Easttown, expect lots of dropped Rs and plenty of Wawa references.\n\nPeacemaker\n\nJohn Cena reprises his role as Chris Smith, aka Peacemaker, a violence-prone vigilante who is willing to do whatever it takes in order to achieve peace—even if that means killing dozens of people. Ironic? Yes. It’s also deeply funny, with Cena seeming to relish the opportunity to play such an over-the-top character. The series, which kicked off its second season in August, is a spinoff of The Suicide Squad and boasts DC boss/superhero auteur James Gunn as its creator, showrunner, writer, and most frequent episode director.\n\nRuby & Jodi: A Cult of Sin and Influence\n\nJust when you think you know everything about the case of disgraced mommy vlogger Ruby Franke, new revelations come to light. This four-part true crime docuseries aims to uncover what drew Franke to the teachings of Jodi Hildebrandt, how the latter rose to power within the Mormon community, and why the bond they shared took such an abusive turn. The series includes interviews with Hildebrandt’s former clients, as well as her niece, who was a first-hand witness to Jodi’s twisted manipulations.\n\nThe Yogurt Shop Murders\n\nOn December 6, 1991, a police officer responding to reports of a fire at a frozen yogurt shop in Austin, Texas, was horrified to discover the bodies of four teenage girls inside. All four girls, who ranged in age from 13 to 17, had been shot in the head, and at least one of the young women had been raped. More than 30 years later, the events of that night continue to haunt not just the friends and family members of the victims, but the law enforcement officials who investigated the gruesome crime, the individuals who were considered suspects, and even the media members who covered it. HBO’s enthralling new four-part docuseries takes a deep dive into the killings, which remained unsolved until September 29, when investigators in Texas announced that DNA evidence and ballistics had helped to name a (now-deceased) suspect in brutal slayings.\n\nThe Gilded Age\n\nWhile it hasn’t made quite the splash that Downton Abbey did, Julian Fellowes’ latest period piece is just as decadent—and really came into its own with its second season, then became addictive in its third. In this case, the drama moves stateside to document the struggle between New York City’s old-money aristocrats and the vulgar new-money types attempting to infiltrate their social circles. There’s also plenty of the Upstairs, Downstairs–type drama that Fellowes is known for, with the servants who cater to Manhattan’s elite playing a big part of the story here too. Somewhere in the middle of it all is Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson, Meryl Streep's youngest child), a young woman attempting to navigate a world she only belongs to by proxy. Christine Baranski, Carrie Coon, and Cynthia Nixon lead a stellar cast. Its third season, which concluded in August, is getting some of the series’ strongest reviews. A fourth season is already confirmed.\n\nThe Mortician\n\nHBO delivered one of its most iconic series in the mid-2000s with the family funeral home-set Six Feet Under. The Mortician is essentially the flip side of that critically acclaimed drama: It’s a three-part docuseries that explores the disturbing story of the Lamb Funeral Home, a real-life Los Angeles business that made headlines in the 1980s when it was alleged that its new owner, David Sconce, was engaging in reprehensible practices that seemed to value profit over human life. Years later, and after spending more than a decade in prison on two separate occasions (the second time for violating his parole), Sconce sits down to speak about his crimes, and still seems unmoved by the emotional damage he has caused.\n\nThe Rehearsal\n\nGood luck trying to explain what The Rehearsal is to anyone who isn’t familiar with Nathan Fielder’s mastery of uncomfortable comedy. What begins as a series in which the awkward star/comedian attempts to help people prepare for big moments in life by rehearsing them until they get it right quickly turns into a bizarre social experiment in which Fielder himself becomes one of the key players. The less you know about it ahead of time, the better. Just be aware that you’ll be encountering people who responded to a Craigslist ad to take part in season 1, and that the second season sees Fielder stepping in to create a wild role-playing environment to improve communication between pilots, with the hope of preventing plane crashes. It might make you worry about exactly who is commandeering your next flight and give whole new meaning to the chorus of Evanescence’s 2003 hit “Bring Me To Life.”\n\nConan O'Brien Must Go\n\nConan O'Brien is at his zaniest in this offshoot of his popular podcast, Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend. Whereas the popular audio series features O'Brien chatting with his fellow celebrities, this globe-trotting series sees the former late-night host surprising everyday people he has featured on said podcast. But it doubles as a kind of travel series, as he uses the time in these far-off places (which, in the first season, included Norway, Thailand, Argentina, and Ireland) to immerse himself in the food, traditions, and culture of his chosen destinations. Season 2 sees O’Brien visit New Zealand, Austria, and Spain over three episodes. It's a short season, to be sure, but a third season is already confirmed.\n\nThe Last of Us\n\nThe Last of Us managed to succeed where Netflix’s Resident Evil (which was canceled after one season) and other live-action TV shows based on video games failed—by being really, really good. Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and the video game’s original director, Neil Druckmann, cocreated the postapocalyptic drama, in which one grizzled survivor (Pedro Pascal) is tasked with smuggling a smart-mouthed teenager (Bella Ramsey) who could be the key to finding a cure for the fungal infection-fueled pandemic that has turned most of America into zombie-like creatures. Props to everyone for generating so much interest in the (very real and parasitic) Cordyceps fungus—because fungi nerds like TV too. After a near two-year wait, the show’s second season arrived in April. Set five years after the events of the first season, it begins with Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey) having seemingly found a permanent community, despite discord in their own relationship—and zombies that are getting smarter. But the latest season takes some unexpected turns that viewers who aren’t familiar with the video game may not see coming—a trend that will seemingly continue when its third season eventually arrives.\n\nHacks\n\nJean Smart has always been a legend, so it’s only appropriate that she plays a legend in Hacks. Four seasons in, the show follows the evolution of the relationship between world-renowned Las Vegas entertainer Deborah Vance (Smart) and Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder, daughter of SNL legend Laraine Newman), a cynical young writer who is on the outs with Hollywood following a bad-take tweet that went viral. What begins as a reluctant “mentorship” slowly transforms into a loving and respectful friendship in which both women realize they have something to learn from the other. The show has won a slew of awards, including 12 Emmys (four of them for Smart)—a streak that is likely to continue following the show’s dramatic fourth season, which ended with a development that already has fans wondering what season 5 (which is already ordered, and Einbinder says will be its last) might look like.\n\nThe Righteous Gemstones\n\nThe Righteous Gemstones is Danny McBride's latest effort to put forth a group of highly unlikeable people and find a way to make you like them even less but still want to keep watching. In this case, it’s a family of televangelists whose real god is greed and power. McBride assembled an all-star cast that includes John Goodman as the family’s patriarch, Adam DeVine and Edi Patterson as his fellow Gemstone children, and national treasure Walton Goggins as Uncle Baby Billy Freeman—a child-star-turned-grifter who has given the series some of its most memorable quotes and moments. (Can you say Baby Billy’s Bible Bonkers?) The series’ fourth and final season, which added Megan Mullally and Seann William Scott to the mix, concluded in May, with all episodes streaming now.\n\nWhen No One Sees Us\n\nHBO Max’s first Spanish-produced series, adapted from Sergio Sarria’s novel of the same name, is a smart, slow-burning crime drama. US Army special agent Magaly Castillo (Mariela Garriga) is sent to a base in Morón de la Frontera, Spain, to look into the strange disappearance of a soldier. Not far away, Civil Guard sergeant Lucía Gutiérrez (Maribel Verdú) is investigating a suicide that has ritualistic elements of harakiri. Eventually, their investigations begin to overlap, and the two work together—despite protocol and politics—to understand what is happening around them.\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nWhile it was originally imagined as a one-off limited series from the brilliantly screwed-up mind (in a good way) of Mike White—who cocreated the sadly overlooked Enlightenment with Laura Dern, another HBO show you should check out—The White Lotus has since morphed into a full-on, five-star franchise that just wrapped up its wild third season. The series dives below the surface of the seemingly fabulous lives of deep-pocketed guests who can afford to stay at one of the ultra-luxe resorts of the title’s locations (first Hawaii, then Sicily, followed by Thailand), and the people who trip over themselves to serve their every need. Somewhere in between, murder always seems to end up on the menu. The newest season proved to be deliciously addictive, with Walton Goggins, Carrie Coon, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Michelle Monaghan, Leslie Bibb, and Aimee Lou Wood among the delightfully dysfunctional guests—plus a surprise cameo from Sam Rockwell as a wild character who won’t soon be forgotten. While fans of the series lamented the loss of Jennifer Coolidge as a recurring cast member, writer/actor Natasha Rothwell did her former would-be business partner proud (and Coolidge’s lying husband dirty) by reprising her role as Belinda Lindsey, the spa manager fans met (and rooted for) in Season 1. A fourth season has already been greenlit, but production won’t begin until 2026—meaning it could be 2027 before viewers see the next season of The White Lotus, wherever in the world the show goes (rumors are swirling that it will be France).\n\nThe Pitt\n\nFirst things first: Yes, The Pitt is a medical drama that reunites ER star Noah Wyle with executive producer John Wells. But that’s essentially where the similarities to that iconic NBC series end. Really, The Pitt has more in common with 24. Set in an underfunded hospital in Pittsburgh, the series plays out over 15 hours in real time as patients come and go (in some cases, shuffling off this mortal coil); medical students and interns learn the truth about their chosen profession; and seasoned doctors and hospital administrators butt heads over the nature of the US health care system. It’s an engaging watch that moves at a breakneck speed while offering a somber reality about medicine in a post-pandemic world. Season 1 was a near-perfect season of television, and its five Emmys—including wins for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for Katherine LaNasa, Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for Shawn Hatosy, as well as a much-deserved Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Wyle—are a testament to that. A second season—which will follow the same real-time format and take place over Fourth of July weekend—is already in production, with a planned January 2026 premiere.\n\nSomebody Somewhere\n\nSam (the amazing Bridget Everett) is a forty-something woman who has lost her way. After returning to her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, to care for her dying sister, she is left broken and floundering following her sister’s death. Unsure of who she is, what she is doing, or where she fits in, she slowly starts to find her place thanks to Joel (Jeff Hiller), a coworker and former classmate. With his friendship and support, and reconnecting with her love of singing, Sam starts to learn that we don’t need to have the answers to know when something feels “right.” The Peabody Award–winning series is one of the best things to happen to TV audiences in a long time—and a reminder that “acceptance” is in the mind of the beholder. While it managed to fly somewhat under the radar during its three seasons, all of which are streaming now, that changed on September 14 when Hiller won the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and delivered one of the night’s most heartfelt—and hilarious—acceptance speeches.\n\nDune: Prophecy\n\nHBO Max is going all in on Frank Herbert’s Dune. In addition to Denis Villeneuve’s two recent Dune movies—which are both streaming here—there’s now Dune: Prophecy. Based on Brian Herbert (son of Frank) and Kevin J. Anderson’s prequel trilogy novels, the series is set 10,000 years before the events witnessed in the Dune films. In this world, it’s the women who rule as two sisters (Emily Watson and Olivia Williams) work to establish the secretive Bene Gesserit sisterhood, who have developed the power to ensure that all future members will be built to stand as powerful leaders. Comparisons to The Handmaid’s Tale are inevitable. There’s more to come: The series was renewed for a second season just days before its season 1 finale.\n\nLike Water for Chocolate\n\nFoodies and romance lovers alike will enjoy this latest adaptation of Laura Esquivel’s seminal 1989 novel. Set during the Mexican Revolution, it tells the story of Tita de la Garza (Azul Guaita) and Pedro Múzquiz (Andres Baida)—a young couple in love. Tita’s cruel mother, Mamá Elena (Irene Azuela), insists that her daughter will take care of her until her death, and thus refuses to consent when Pedro asks for Tita’s hand. Instead, he ends up marrying Tita’s sister Gertrudis (Andrea Chaparro) in an attempt to remain a part of Tita’s life, which only makes their circumstances more agonizing. Tita’s love does not exactly go unrequited: She expresses it in the food she cooks, which is felt by everyone who tastes it. (This is much less silly than it sounds.) A second, and final, season is scheduled to arrive in 2026.\n\nThe Sex Lives of College Girls\n\nMindy Kaling cocreated this HBO Max series, which puts a new spin on the teenage sex comedy—one in which the women are fully in charge. Nerdy Kimberly (Pauline Chalamet, yes, Timothée’s sister), aspiring professional funny person Bela (Amrit Kaur), snotty Upper East Sider Leighton (Reneé Rapp), and soccer star/senator’s daughter Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) are four college freshmen randomly thrown together as suitemates. But as they get to know each other, and themselves, their forced cohabitation develops into a true bond—one in which there’s no such thing as TMI and a “naked party” is just one way to unwind after a long week. Season 3—which saw Rapp depart the series and new roomie Kacey (Gracie Lawrence) take over her space in the quad—wrapped in January and will sadly be its last.\n\nThe Franchise\n\nArmando Iannucci has never met a world he didn’t want to skewer (see: In the Thick of It, Veep, Avenue 5). In the case of The Franchise, which Iannucci co-created with Sam Mendes and Jon Brown, it’s the ridiculousness of superhero movies—and, more specifically, superhero cinematic universes—that is ripe for mockery. Daniel Kumar (Himesh Patel) is the first assistant director on an upcoming movie, Tecto: Eye of the Storm, that’s being made in the shadow of one of its franchise’s team-up movies, Centurios 2, so getting short shrift. Though his name will be buried in the credits, Kumar—who might have the production’s most thankless job—is determined to make a movie that rises above its material. And budget. And actors. And crew. Think of it as a satirical potshot at the MCU. Sadly, one season is all we’re going to get of Iannucci’s latest; HBO canceled the series in early January.\n\nIt's Florida, Man\n\n“What you’re about to see may be dangerous, petty, misguided, and most definitely stupid,” warns the voiceover in the trailer. “But it’s also all true. Sort of.” Danny McBride strikes again (as one of the executive producers) on this new late-night series that brings the unbelievable, infamous “Florida Man” headlines to life. Each episode recreates these Floridians' stories with an A-list lineup of comedic actors, including Anna Faris, Jake Johnson, Randall Park, Juliette Lewis, Sam Richardson, and Ego Nwodim. Get ready for feral bunnies, mermaids being harassed by witches, and so much more. HBO Max has already given the green light to a second season.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nWhile superhero/villain TV shows typically tend to be the domain of Disney+, The Penguin is different—in so many ways. Spun off from Matt Reeves’ The Batman (2022) and based on the characters famously created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, The Penguin takes a very prestige TV approach to its comic book origins. Which is likely partly why you’ve heard so many comparisons between The Penguin and The Sopranos—a likening that is somewhat overblown. (Though Colin Farrell’s Oswald “Oz” Cobb does bear a passing resemblance to James Gandolfini’s legendary mob boss.) Still, The Penguin is its own beast; it’s an origin story that documents Oz’s violent rise to power following the death of Gotham crime boss Carmine Falcone. While Farrell’s Penguin was one of the most compelling parts of Reeves’ The Batman, here it’s Cristin Milioti—who manages to be utterly charming despite playing a brutal psychopath—who steals the show as Carmen’s daughter Sofia Falcone, a mastermind battling Oz for control of Gotham’s underworld. While conversations are reportedly being had, there’s no word yet on whether a second season will be coming. (Reeves has stated that The Batman 2 is their current priority.)\n\nChimp Crazy\n\n“You can’t tame wild things.” That’s Alan Cumming’s very simple summation of why it’s not a great idea to have a 250-pound chimp living in your home as if it were another family member. Chimp Crazy takes that notion to the extreme. Ostensibly, the four-part docuseries—which comes to HBO Max from the same people who brought us Tiger King—is about the lengths to which Tonia Haddix, a tanning-salon-loving exotic animal broker, will go to ensure she cannot be separated from her beloved chimp Tonka (despite what PETA believes is best for the primate). Ultimately, however, it’s an examination of the “chimp mom” community and the disturbing reality of what can happen when a human being puts their own needs above those of these highly intelligent primates, who need more than living in the suburbs can afford them. While there has been no word about whether there will be a season 2, Haddix’s recent arrest and four-year prison sentence certainly open up the possibility of there being more story to tell here.\n\nIndustry\n\nYou may not have had an “investment banking drama” on your bingo card as your next obsessive binge-watch, but Industry has got a lot more to offer than financial jargon. The British-American series is set in and around Pierpoint & Co., one of London’s most prestigious investment banks and the place that any up-and-comer wants to land a job at. The problem is, Pierpont is picky—and has a very limited number of full-time positions up for grabs. So what you get instead is an inside peek at a cutthroat industry coupled with an ensemble dramedy about the lives of the young professionals competing to make it to the top. Game of Thrones star Kit Harington joined the show—which many have deemed “the new Succession”—for its third season. Kiernan Shipka, Max Minghella, Jack Farthing, Toheeb Jimoh, and Amy James-Kelly have been announced as new cast members for the fourth season, which is expected to arrive in January.\n\nHouse of the Dragon\n\nWhile it would be silly to think any series could replicate the cultural behemoth that was Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon does a pretty admirable job (even if George R.R. Martin doesn’t necessarily agree with all of the creative choices that make it different from the book). Especially if you wished its predecessor had more dragon action. This prequel series, which is set approximately 200 years before Game of Thrones, is all about discord within House Targaryen and the beginning of the end of that ruling family’s dynasty. Just like GoT, there’s enough sex, violence, backstabbing, family dysfunction, and dragons to fill that void—and even the occasional darkly lit scene to get audiences all riled up.\n\nThe Sopranos\n\nIt has been more than 25 years since audiences were introduced to Tony Soprano and his family—both the blood kind and the other kind. Whether you’ve never seen the series that still tops many people’s lists as the greatest television show ever created, or it’s just been a while, it’s time to give it a rewatch. By now the basic premise is well known: Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is a New Jersey mob boss who struggles with depression and panic attacks. So he starts seeing a psychiatrist (Lorraine Bracco), which is a no-no in Tony’s line of work. Over the next six seasons, audiences are invited to experience the life of a mob boss—both the violent side and the mundanities it can bring. A quarter-century later, the series still holds up. For an extra dose of Sopranos content, be sure to check out the 2021 prequel movie, The Many Saints of Newark, or Alex Gibney’s two-part docuseries, Wise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos, both of which are also streaming.\n\nRen Faire\n\nWhat would happen if Succession's Logan Roy were in charge of a Renaissance fair? It might look a lot like Ren Faire. This surprisingly engaging three-part docuseries follows the drama that ensues when George Coulam, founder of the Texas Renaissance Festival (America’s largest Renaissance fair) announces his retirement. While it would seem that the festival’s general manager would be first in line to take over, a kettle corn kingpin and former elephant trainer rise up to challenge that notion of succession. Who knew the Ren faire business was so cutthroat?\n\nFantasmas\n\nCalling all Los Espookys fans: Julio Torres has a new series. And yes, it’s just as absurd and silly and funny as its horror-comedy predecessor. In this case, Torres plays a fictionalized version of himself who ends up wandering New York City looking for a lost earring. Along the way, he encounters all sorts of bizarre characters, with guest appearances from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Emma Stone, Ziwe, Paul Dano, Bowen Yang, and Aidy Bryant.\n\nThe Jinx\n\nThe Jinx is as unnerving as it is fascinating. Director Andrew Jarecki’s first brush with the history of Robert Durst came in the form of All Good Things, the 2010 feature starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst that fictionalized the life of Durst. But when Durst saw what Jarecki had done with that project, he requested they sit down for an interview, which spawned this true-crime docuseries that initially premiered in 2015—and eventually led to new charges being filed against Durst. We won’t give away too much, but suffice to say the words “killed them all, of course” will forever live in your mind. The Jinx Part Two picks up the story after Durst uttered that haunting phrase.\n\nThe Sympathizer\n\nViewers still lamenting the end of The Americans will find much to love about The Sympathizer, which was co-created by acclaimed filmmakers Park Chan-wook and Don McKellar. Based on Viet Thanh Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, this limited series follows the exploits of the Captain (Hoa Xuande), a police captain in the Vietnamese capital then known as Saigon, who also happens to be a communist spy. Eventually, he makes his way to America, where he continues gathering intelligence for the Viet Cong. While it may not sound like the premise of a black comedy, that’s indeed what it is—especially whenever Robert Downey Jr. is around. The Iron Man star makes for a formidable villain who viewers love to hate in each one of the four characters he plays.\n\nJerrod Carmichael Reality Show\n\nOne has to imagine that putting “Reality Show” in the title was somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as this docuseries—in which comedian Jerrod Carmichael claims he’s attempting to “self-Truman Show” himself—is much more intimate and authentic than that label would imply. Carmichael’s goal is to be as honest as he can be about his life and struggles while the cameras are rolling. And if one were to judge his success based on how uncomfortable some viewers might be bearing witness to it all, the show is an absolute triumph.\n\nTokyo Vice\n\nIn 1993, American journalist Jake Adelstein landed a job at the Tokyo-based Yomiuri Shimbun as the newspaper’s first non-Japanese staff writer—a position he held for a dozen years. Nearly 30 years later, in 2022, HBO Max turned Adelstein’s life into a slick crime drama that sees the young journalist (played by Ansel Elgort) forge a deep connection with high-ranking members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, who allow him to get dangerously close to the violence and corruption that exist within the city. In summer 2024, HBO Max announced that the show’s explosive second season would be its last. But Tokyo Vice producers are still holding out hope that a third season will be greenlit elsewhere.\n\nTrue Detective: Night Country\n\nDid you take our advice and watch Deadloch and now you want more of that, but far darker and more creepy? We have just the solution: True Detective: Night Country. Truth be told, this anthology series has had a rough go. Following a wildly successful first season that crashed HBO Max’s predecessor, HBO Go, and had everyone talking about how time is a flat circle, the series’ second and third installments failed to capture the same momentum. Night Country is a return to form, as evidenced by its 19 Emmy nominations (the most of any HBO series in 2024). It stars Jodie Foster, who won her first Emmy for the role, and Kali Reis as a pair of investigators trying to uncover a conspiracy and solve a series of bizarre murders. Mysterious symbols are also involved. Yes, that’s pretty much the plot of every season of True Detective, but this season has corpsicles. As with all of those previous iterations, the less you know at the start, the better. Speaking of the less you know: A fifth season has been commissioned, with Night Country creator Issa López returning as showrunner. Very few details have been revealed except that the season is scheduled to be set in New York’s Jamaica Bay, and that Nicolas Cage is in talks to play the lead.\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\n\n“I really did the best under the circumstances of a person who hates people and yet had to be amongst them,” Larry David says in the trailer for the 12th—and final (yes, really)—season of Curb Your Enthusiasm. David—both the real-life comedian and the semi-fictionalized version of himself he plays on TV—has been dipping in and out of our lives for more than 20 years now. And he continually exceeded audience expectations with each new season of Curb. Even though he cocreated Seinfeld, one of the most game-changing TV series of all time, it’s Curb Your Enthusiasm to which he’ll always be more closely linked. Pretty good for a social assassin. Pretty, pretty good. While Curb might be dead, David’s partnership with HBO is alive and well; in July, it was announced that he’ll be bringing a new comedy sketch series to the network.\n\nRap Sh!t\n\nInsecure impresario Issa Rae is the brains behind this laugh-out-loud comedy, which follows Mia Knight (KaMillion) and Shawna Clark (Aida Osman), two former high school friends and struggling rappers trying to make it on the Miami music scene. Ultimately, they decide to join forces to form a group, double their chances of success, and use social media as their launching pad—all with mixed results. As much as the series is about music, at its heart it’s really about the unending possibilities of youthdom and the beauty of women supporting women. At just two seasons long, it’s an easy binge-watch.\n\nStarstruck\n\nJessie (Rose Matafeo) is a twentysomething New Zealander attempting to make ends meet as a nanny in London. One New Year’s Eve, she has a drunken one-night stand, only to sober up and realize she just slept with Tom Kapoor (Nikesh Patel), a major movie star. But what was presumably a one-off encounter turns into much more over time in this charming romcom series, which is a little bit like Notting Hill—only drunker.\n\nOur Flag Means Death\n\nRhys Darby and Taika Waititi do what Rhys Darby and Taika Waititi do best as two very different kinds of pirates who cross paths in the 1700s. Darby plays Stede Bonnet, a fictionalized version of a very real member of the landed gentry whose version of a midlife crisis sees him abandon his family and hit the high seas for a swashbuckling adventure. Waititi, meanwhile, plays the infamous Blackbeard, who learns of Bonnet and seeks him out. What begins as a kind of mentorship eventually becomes the gay pirate action-comedy series you never knew you needed.\n\nHow to With John Wilson\n\nIf Steven Wright and Nathan Fielder decided to create a YouTube channel of how-to tutorials on topics like putting up scaffolding and covering furniture in plastic, it might look a lot like How to With John Wilson. So it probably comes as no surprise that Fielder is an executive producer of the series, which follows Wilson as he attempts to uncover the secrets of such universal dilemmas as how to make small talk. Wilson’s surprising mix of earnestness and deadpan delivery make the series surprising, enlightening, and extremely strange.\n\nProject Greenlight: A New Generation\n\nIn 2001, just three years after Good Will Hunting made them bona fide Oscar winners, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck launched Project Greenlight, a competition that gave aspiring filmmakers the chance to make a real, live movie—which begat Project Greenlight, a reality series that chronicled the ups and downs (mostly downs) of that experience. While the competition was better known for the TV series it spawned versus the movies that it produced, it’s now more than 20 years later. And, as new mentors Issa Rae, Kumail Nanjiani, and Gina Prince-Bythewood quickly realize, it’s all still a bit of a nightmare. Gray Matter, the movie that was created from the competition’s rebirth, is also streaming on HBO Max, so you can judge for yourself whether things are different this time around.\n\nThe Other Two\n\nChasedreams (Case Walker) is a 13-year-old internet icon whose overnight rise to global stardom has become the sole focus of his mom (Molly Shannon). Chase’s older siblings, however, are having a much harder time finding success. Brother Cary (Drew Tarver) is an aspiring actor who can’t even land the part of “Man at Party Who Smells Fart,” while sister Brooke (Heléne Yorke) is just trying to figure out who and what she wants to be. All three seasons of the series, which was cocreated by former SNL head writers Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, are available to binge.\n\nBarry\n\nNo one seemed particularly wowed when HBO announced that Bill Hader and Alec Berg were cocreating a series in which Hader would play a hitman with a conscience who attempts to go straight. But what might sound like a played-out trope has taken on new dimensions of humor, darkness, humanity, and plain old weirdness, with its recently concluded final season serving as a brilliant crescendo of all of that dark weirdness mixed in with a little time jump. Barry Berkman (Hader) is a traumatized marine whose newfound apathy toward the world and the very act of living makes him perfectly suited to work as a gun for hire. When a job takes him to Los Angeles, Barry stumbles upon an acting class led by Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler, in what may be the role that finally supplants Fonzie as his most memorable), a failed but charismatic mentor. But transitioning back into the real world isn’t without consequences for Barry, who can spend an entire episode being hunted by a pint-sized martial arts master. All four seasons of the Emmy-winning series, each one better than the next, are available to stream in full.\n\nSuccession\n\nMedia empires run by dysfunctional families may rise and fall, but we’ll always have Succession. The Emmy-winning series concluded its four-season run in early 2023, but its legacy as one of the most surprising pieces of prestige TV will be felt for decades to come (especially after what happened at Shiv’s wedding … then “Connor’s Wedding,” not to mention on the balcony or in the hand-hold seen ’round the world). At a time when TV shows about rich people, real or imagined, are in ample supply, Succession manages to stand out by being as bitingly funny as it is painfully tragic. The jet-black family dramedy chronicles the Roy family and the people/cronies/tall men who orbit them, all of whom seem to be angling for control of Waystar Royco, the family-run global media conglomerate—whether by succession (get it?) or more hostile means. Think of it as King Lear meets Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., only funny. (Unless you’re invited to play a game of Boar on the Floor.)\n\nA Black Lady Sketch Show\n\nIn 2015, Robin Thede made television history when she was named head writer for The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore—making her the first Black woman to hold the head writer position on a late-night talk show. Four years later, she revolutionized the TV landscape once again when she gathered up a group of her funniest friends—including Ashley Nicole Black, (future Abbott Elementary creator) Quinta Brunson, Gabrielle Dennis, and Skye Townsend—and created A Black Lady Sketch Show, the first sketch comedy written, produced, and starring Black women. The four-season series has brought such A-list names as Angela Bassett out as guest stars with its no-holds-barred humor, and the entire series is available to stream now.\n\nRain Dogs\n\nCostello Jones (Daisy May Cooper) is an aspiring novelist and working-class mom who isn’t always successful at making ends meet for herself and her wise-beyond-her-years daughter, Iris (Fleur Tashjian). So Costello is regularly forced to call upon her violence-prone—but wealthy—gay best friend, Selby (Jack Farthing), to unstick them from whatever jams they’ve managed to get caught in. The series is billed as a black comedy, which it definitely is, although the moments between the levity are sometimes so dark and raw that even the frothiest bits carry weight. This darkly nuanced and sometimes surreal meditation on class, sex, dysfunction, and the varying definitions of “family” makes for a compulsively watchable series. Sadly, the BBC-HBO coproduction was canceled after one season, so the eight existing episodes are all you get.\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nAbbott Elementary creator/star Quinta Brunson (A Black Lady Sketch Show) has garnered all sorts of accolades with this ABC series and even managed to create streaming deals with both HBO Max and Hulu. The surprise hit follows the lives of a group of teachers who are working at one of the most woefully underfunded public schools in America while doing their best to inspire students. Yes, it all sounds very earnest—and it is—but it’s also the kind of funny we don’t see much of on network TV anymore. The series—which premiered its fifth season debut on Oct. 1—has racked up enough awards (Emmys, Critics Choice, Indie Spirit, and beyond) to fill a school trophy case.\n\nI May Destroy You\n\nMichaela Coel is a creative force of nature who delivered on what she promised with the title of this limited series, which she created, wrote, directed, and stars in. Arabella (Coel) is a Londoner living the millennial dream with a thriving writing career, thanks in part to her celebrity as a social media influencer. But Arabella’s Insta-perfect life begins to unravel when, after a night out with friends, she begins to recall—in fragments—being sexually assaulted. Eventually, the need to piece together exactly what happened to her, and who did it, consumes her completely and the past comes knocking at her door. Last August, Coel announced she was working jointly with HBO and BBC on a new series, First Day on Earth, that will be equally personal.\n\nAvenue 5\n\nBad timing may have led to the unfortunately early demise of Avenue 5, which had filming on its second season delayed, and delayed again, due to Covid-19. But the space-set comedy from the brilliant mind of Armando Iannucci, creator of Veep (another classic streaming on HBO Max), and its even swearier predecessor, The Thick of It, is well worth your time, if only to see what could happen when space travel inevitably goes wrong. Hugh Laurie stars as the “captain” of an interplanetary cruise ship, with Josh Gad playing the role of eccentric tech billionaire/huge baby Herman Judd, whose planned eight-week tour of the galaxy turns dire when a gravitational disaster steers the ship off course. The series gets more bonkers as it goes along, and poop plays a massive part in saving thousands of passengers and crew members. Consider yourselves warned—and feel free to laugh at the inanity of it all.

We consider it the best Android phone you can buy, and right now, you can grab it at Amazon starting at $449 ($350 off) when you use promo code PIXEL10, which drops Google’s entry-level flagship to its lowest price to date. If you prefer a better cameras or a bigger screen, Amazon is also offering the Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL for $649 ($350 off) and $799 ($400 off), respectively, using the same code.\n\nIn her review, Verge senior reviewer Allison Johnson called the Pixel 10 a great, basic Android phone that offers some notable upgrades over its predecessor. It features a 6.3-inch OLED screen and a 120Hz refresh rate, along with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, making it easy to see in direct sunlight. It also includes an array of helpful AI-powered tools and a dedicated telephoto camera — a first for a non-Pro Pixel phone — which is great for capturing portrait photos.\n\nOne of the Pixel 10’s more notable upgrades, though, is the addition of Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets — arguably the coolest part of the device — which means you don’t need a separate case for easy and precise charging alignment. The device also includes Google’s Tensor G5 chip, which is the same one found in the pricier Pro models; however, the Pixel 10 has slightly lower RAM (12GB versus 16GB). Still, you shouldn’t notice any major differences in everyday performance, unless you’re really pushing it with heavy multitasking and serious mobile gaming.\n\nOur main gripe with the Pixel 10 is that its main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as those on the Pro.

{"title": "Trump administration’s ban on foreign-made drones starts this week.

Indeed, DJI is considered to be one of the most popular drone brands for American consumers.\n\nWhen reached for comment by TechCrunch, DJI said it disapproved of the decision. “DJI is disappointed by the Federal Communications Commission’s action today to add foreign‑made drones to the Covered List. While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.”\n\n\n\nThe company, which said that it remained committed to the U.S. market, continued: “As the industry leader, DJI has advocated for an open, competitive market that benefits all US consumers and commercial users, and will continue to do so. DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by U.S. government agencies and independent third parties.”\n\nThroughout his multiple presidential administrations, Trump has repeatedly played hardball with Chinese companies. His administration laid the groundwork for the new drone ban with an executive order passed in June that sought to boost the production of U.S.-made drones and thus foster a “strong and secure domestic drone sector,” while also securing “the United States drone supply chain against foreign control or exploitation.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:16:04 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T21:25:01.356116"}

Because the season finale for the show — a sci-fi drama on Apple TV, helmed by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan — made it clear that things are just getting started. The episode brought together a number of significant threads but, more importantly, opened up potentially explosive (literally) new lines of inquiry for what comes next.\n\nSpoiler to follow for the first season of Pluribus.\n\nFirst, a little reminder of how we got here. The inciting incident of Pluribus was the release of a virus of unknown, but extraterrestrial, origins, that turned almost the entirety of the Earth’s human population into an interconnected hive mind. The hive are peaceful, to the point that they won’t even kill a bug or pick an apple off of a tree, and they are physically harmed by negative emotions. There are around a dozen people who weren’t impacted by the virus. Most notably this includes an American woman named Carol (Rhea Seehorn) and a Paraguayan man named Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga). For most of the season, the pair have been separated physically, but united in being vehemently opposed to the hive’s presence, while trying to figure out a way to “save” the world by making it the way it used to be.\n\nThe finale sees these two finally able to meet up with each other — but things have changed for Carol. In the penultimate episode, her feelings toward the hive began to soften, primarily as she grew closer to her chaperone Zosia (Karolina Wydra). In fact, by the time the finale starts, they’re a full-on couple. It’s a far cry from the early days of the show, when Carol was so antagonistic to the hive that they abandoned her and the city of Albuquerque for safety reasons.\n\nBut Carol’s new view of the hive, and Zosia in particular, means that things don’t go quite the way Manousos expected. Instead of finding a like-minded comrade who would help him “save the world,” he finds a version of Carol that is reluctant to even speak to him. The dynamic is much like Pluribus’ second episode, in which Carol fails to convince the rest of the survivors that they should work toward putting the world back the way it was. Only this time the roles are reversed. Combine this dynamic with the fact that Carol and Manousos are both extremely stubborn people who are using Google Translate to communicate and, well, it’s not exactly a smooth meeting. After the first time the two talk, Manousos mutters to himself “well this is going just great.”\n\nImage: Apple\n\nBy the end of the episode, though, the two seem largely on the same page. And that’s because Carol learns that, despite her budding romance with Zosia, the hive are still diligently working on bringing her into the fold (the episode actually opens by showing one of the other survivors joining the hive via a new procedure). This all culminates with Carol receiving a large package that turns out to be an atom bomb. I guess she wasn’t joking earlier in the season.\n\nThe first season of Pluribus has been a learning experience. While there are plenty of postapocalyptic shows, there’s really nothing quite like this strange, hive-mind-infected version of Earth. And so over nine episodes we see Carol emotionally coming to grips with her new reality, but also using that time to learn as much as she can about how the hive operates. This, in turn, helps us, the audience, understand just what the heck is going on. All stories require some kind of scene-setting, but Pluribus’ unique nature requires that much more.\n\nBut the reveal of the atom bomb at the end suggests that things are going in a different direction in season 2. I don’t expect Pluribus to suddenly become a fast-paced show; its measured pace is part of its appeal and allows it to really dig into the nitty-gritty details of the world. But many of the remaining plotlines and questions require more action than simply learning more about the hive. Manousos may have figured out a way to pull individuals out of the hive using radio signals; the hive are in the midst of building a “giant antenna” to possibly communicate with whoever or whatever sent the virus in the first place; the rest of the survivors have to decide whether or not they want to join; the hive need to sort out a solution to their impending food crisis; and, oh, there’s that bomb that Carol may or may not have a plan for.\n\nI don’t know how many seasons the Pluribus story can reasonably stretch for, but it’s clear it needed at least two, just because there’s so much to set up. It’s not all that different from Apple TV’s other delightfully weird sci-fi series, Severance, a show that had a similarly unique premise and really pulled everything together by the end of its second season. Now we’ll have to wait and see if Pluribus can do the same.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-24T03:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T08:36:49.282558"}

Over the past few years, we've periodically reported on its successes; last year, it won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nUntil AlphaFold's debut in November 2020, DeepMind had been best known for teaching an artificial intelligence to beat human champions at the ancient game of Go. Then it started playing something more serious, aiming its deep learning algorithms at one of the most difficult problems in modern science: protein folding. The result was AlphaFold2, a system capable of predicting the three-dimensional shape of proteins with atomic accuracy.\n\nIts work culminated in the compilation of a database that now contains over 200 million predicted structures, essentially the entire known protein universe, and is used by nearly 3.5 million researchers in 190 countries around the world The Nature article published in 2021 describing the algorithm has been cited 40,000 times to date. Last year, AlphaFold 3 arrived, extending the capabilities of artificial intelligence to DNA, RNA, and drugs. That transition is not without challenges—such as “structural hallucinations” in the disordered regions of proteins—but it marks a step toward the future.\n\nTo understand what the next five years holds for AlphaFold, WIRED spoke with Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of research at DeepMind and architect of the AI ​​for Science division.\n\nWIRED: Dr. Kohli, the arrival of AlphaFold 2 five years ago has been called \"the iPhone moment\" for biology. Tell us about the transition from challenges like the game of Go to a fundamental scientific problem like protein folding, and what was your role in this transition?\n\nPushmeet Kohli: Science has been central to our mission from day one. Demis Hassabis founded Google DeepMind on the idea that AI could be the best tool ever invented for accelerating scientific discovery. Games were always a testing ground, and a way to develop techniques we knew would eventually tackle real-world problems.\n\nMy role has really been about identifying and pursuing scientific problems where AI can make a transformative impact, outlining the key ingredients required to unlock progress, and bringing together a multidisciplinary team to work on these grand challenges. What AlphaGo proved was that neural networks combined with planning and search could master incredibly complex systems. Protein folding had those same characteristics.

But just as she was about to start cooking, having already bought everything, one thing stood out: The recipe told her to start by “logging” the chicken into the slow cooker.\n\nConfused, she clicked on the recipe blog’s “About” page. An uncannily perfect-looking woman beamed back at her, golden light bouncing off her apron and tousled hair. Jones realized instantly what appeared to be going on: The woman was AI-generated.\n\n“Hi there, I’m Souzan Thorne!” the page read. “I grew up in a home where the kitchen was the heart of everything.” The accompanying images were flawless but odd, the biography vague and generic.\n\n“It seems dumb I didn’t catch this sooner, but being in my normal grocery shop rush, I didn’t even think this would be an issue,” says Jones, who lives in California. Backed into a culinary corner, she made the dubious dish, and it wasn’t good: The watery, bland chicken left a bad taste in her mouth.\n\nNeeding to vent, she turned to the subreddit r/Pinterest, which has become a town square for disgruntled users. “Pinterest is losing everything people loved, which was authentic Pins and authentic people,” she wrote. She says that she’s since sworn off the app entirely.\n\n“AI slop” is a term for low-quality, mass-produced, AI-generated content clogging up the internet, from videos to books to posts on Medium. And Pinterest users say the site is rife with it.\n\nIt’s an “unappetizing gruel being forcefully fed to us,” Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, wrote in his recently published taxonomy of AI slop. And “Souzan”—for whom a Google search doesn’t turn up a single result—is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n“All platforms have decided this is part of the new normal,” Mantzarlis tells WIRED. “It is a huge part of the content being produced across the board.”\n\n\"Enshittification\"\n\nPinterest launched in 2010 and marketed itself as a “visual discovery engine for finding ideas.” The site remained ad-free for years, building a loyal community of creatives. It has since grown to over half a billion active users. But, according to some unhappy users, their feeds have begun to reflect a very different world in recently.\n\nPinterest’s feed is mostly images, which means it’s more susceptible to AI slop than video-led sites, says Mantzarlis, as realistic images are typically easier for models to generate than videos. The platform also funnels users toward outside sites, and those outbound clicks are easier for content farms to monetize than on-site followers.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T10:49:15.537050"}

With the rise of AI agents, the next data grab is far more private.", "content": "For years, the cost of using “free” services from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other Big Tech firms has been handing over your data. Uploading your life into the cloud and using free tech brings conveniences, but it puts personal information in the hands of giant corporations that will often be looking to monetize it. Now, the next wave of generative AI systems are likely to want more access to your data than ever before.\n\nOver the past two years, generative AI tools—such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini—have moved beyond the relatively straightforward, text-only chatbots that the companies initially released. Instead, Big AI is increasingly building and pushing toward the adoption of agents and “assistants” that promise they can take actions and complete tasks on your behalf. The problem? To get the most out of them, you’ll need to grant them access to your systems and data. While much of the initial controversy over large language models (LLMs) was the flagrant copying of copyrighted data online, AI agents’ access to your personal data will likely cause a new host of problems.\n\n“AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you’re running them,” says Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, whose work has included studying the impact of AI assistants and found that they may cause “profound threat” to cybersecurity and privacy. For personalization of chatbots or assistants, Farmer says, there can be data trade-offs. “All those things, in order to work, need quite a lot of information about you,” he says.\n\nexpired: AI training data grabs tired: opting out of AI training wired: all-access AI agents Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nWhile there’s no strict definition of what an AI agent actually is, they’re often best thought of as a generative AI system or LLM that has been given some level of autonomy. At the moment, agents or assistants, including AI web browsers, can take control of your device and browse the web for you, booking flights, conducting research, or adding items to shopping carts. Some can complete tasks that include dozens of individual steps.\n\nWhile current AI agents are glitchy and often can’t complete the tasks they’ve been set out to do, tech companies are betting the systems will fundamentally change millions of people’s jobs as they become more capable. A key part of their utility likely comes from access to data. So, if you want a system that can provide you with your schedule and tasks, it’ll need access to your calendar, messages, emails, and more.\n\nSome more advanced AI products and features provide a glimpse into how much access agents and systems could be given. Certain agents being developed for businesses can read code, emails, databases, Slack messages, files stored in Google Drive, and more. Microsoft’s controversial Recall product takes screenshots of your desktop every few seconds, so that you can search everything you’ve done on your device. Tinder has created an AI feature that can search through photos on your phone “to better understand” users’ “interests and personality.”\n\nCarissa Véliz, an author and associate professor at the University of Oxford, says most of the time consumers have no real way to check if AI or tech companies are handling their data in the ways they claim to. “These companies are very promiscuous with data,” Véliz says. “They have shown to not be very respectful of privacy.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:24:20.388992"}

Not everyone lands coding jobs right away.", "content": "Two years ago, Lizmary Fernandez took a detour from studying to be an immigration attorney to join a free Apple course for making iPhone apps. The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit launched as part of the company’s $200 million response to the Black Lives Matter protests and aims to expand opportunities for people of color in the country’s poorest big city.\n\nBut Fernandez found the program’s cost-of-living stipend lacking—“A lot of us got on food stamps,” she says—and the coursework insufficient for landing a coding job. “I didn’t have the experience or portfolio,” says the 25-year-old, who is now a flight attendant and preparing to apply to law school. “Coding is not something I got back to.”\n\nSince 2021, the academy has welcomed over 1,700 students, a racially diverse mix with varying levels of tech literacy and financial flexibility. About 600 students, including Fernandez, have completed its 10-month course of half-days at Michigan State University, which cosponsors the Apple-branded and Apple-focused program.\n\nWIRED reviewed contracts and budgets and spoke with officials and graduates for the first in-depth examination of the nearly $30 million invested in the academy over the past four years—almost 30 percent of which came from Michigan taxpayers and the university’s regular students. As tech giants begin pouring billions of dollars into AI-related job training courses across the country, the Apple academy offers lessons on the challenges of uplifting diverse communities.\n\nMeasuring Success\n\nSeven graduates who spoke with WIRED said they had good experiences at the academy, citing benefits such as receiving mentorship from past students. Fernandez says she was impressed by a focus on developing inclusive apps and a series of speakers from Apple who were genuinely willing to help and share frank lessons. “Their heart was in the right place,” she says.\n\nThe program does expose people of color to new possibilities. “It changed my life,” says Min Thu Khine, who’s now mentoring coding students and working at an Apple Store Genius Bar. “My dream is to be a software engineer at Apple.”\n\nThe academy also draws positive grades from some researchers who study tech education, such as Quinn Burke. He says its fully subsidized in-person instruction surpasses the quality of many coding bootcamps, which proliferated over the past decade and sometimes left students in debt and with narrow skills.\n\nBut the academy being open to all can complicate instruction and how to measure success. One entire family attended together, and at least two mothers have come with their daughters. Students on average are in their 30s, ranging from 18-year-olds to, for example, a grandfather in his 70s who wanted to develop a photo app for his grandchild, according to Sarah Gretter, the academy leader for Michigan State.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T12:54:08.342209"}

But these tools are not magic and can complicate rather than simplify a software project. Understanding how they work under the hood can help developers know when (and if) to use them, while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nWe’ll start with the basics: At the core of every AI coding agent is a technology called a large language model (LLM), which is a type of neural network trained on vast amounts of text data, including lots of programming code. It’s a pattern-matching machine that uses a prompt to “extract” compressed statistical representations of data it saw during training and provide a plausible continuation of that pattern as an output. In this extraction, an LLM can interpolate across domains and concepts, resulting in some useful logical inferences when done well and confabulation errors when done poorly.\n\nThese base models are then further refined through techniques like fine-tuning on curated examples and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which shape the model to follow instructions, use tools, and produce more useful outputs.\n\nCredit: Anthropic A screenshot of the Claude Code command-line interface.\n\nOver the past few years, AI researchers have been probing LLMs’ deficiencies and finding ways to work around them. One recent innovation was the simulated reasoning model, which generates context (extending the prompt) in the form of reasoning-style text that can help an LLM home in on a more accurate output. Another innovation was an application called an “agent” that links several LLMs together to perform tasks simultaneously and evaluate outputs.\n\nHow coding agents are structured\n\nIn that sense, each AI coding agent is a program wrapper that works with multiple LLMs. There is typically a “supervising” LLM that interprets tasks (prompts) from the human user and then assigns those tasks to parallel LLMs that can use software tools to execute the instructions. The supervising agent can interrupt tasks below it and evaluate the subtask results to see how a project is going. Anthropic’s engineering documentation describes this pattern as “gather context, take action, verify work, repeat.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:00:27 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T12:54:09.375586"}

Its ad tier, introduced last year, has grown significantly, and its live TV initiative has expanded to include not only weird one-offs like hot-dog-eating grudge matches but also WWE programming. Taking KPop Demon Hunters off Sony's hands for the business equivalent of $200 in a potato chip bag also [&#8230;]", "content": "But KPop Demon Hunters wasn’t the streamer’s only quality offering this year. Here’s a list of Netflix’s best of 2025.\n\nSean Combs: The Reckoning\n\nThe documentary features new interviews from former associates, employees, and friends who allege everything from cheating business partners out of their share to having knowledge of if not outright arranging the hit that took Tupac Shakur’s life. This is not a “fun” watch, so heed the content warnings, but if you want a succinct accounting of where Combs came from and how the business of hip-hop can turn men into monsters, this is an informative overview.\n\nKPop Demon Hunters\n\nThere is vanishingly little I can say about KPop Demon Hunters’ brilliance that hasn’t already been said. So I’ll let what has been said speak for it:\n\nRian Johnson’s Knives Out series has once again delivered a sharply funny, intensely moving whodunit. Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc drips southern charm, aided by an ensemble cast featuring Josh Brolin as a fiery Catholic priest and Glenn Close as his secretary. Josh O’Connor delivers some beautiful moments as a junior priest struggling to find meaning in his faith, creating interesting tension against Blanc’s cold, grim logic. With them working together, Wake Up Dead Man becomes a fun story that examines the purpose faith can have in our lives.\n\nOne thing director Guillermo del Toro is gonna do is make a luxurious, sumptuous-ass movie with over-the-top sets and costuming. But Frankenstein is not just a visual delight. Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his monster give incredible performances that are both grounded in the movie’s late Victorian aesthetic while resonating with the stories of today. A quote unquote learned man irresponsibly using technology to create something he doesn’t understand and in his arrogance tries to control that winds up destroying his life and others? It’s not that Frankenstein is any one allegory for today, it has multiple applications.\n\nAnd while we have numerous Frankenstein adaptations, there’s nothing quite like watching GDT do it. You just know that man is gonna grab all the production designers, make-up artists, and costumers, give them some cash, and say essentially “Cook,” and damn if they didn’t do exactly that.\n\nThe Great British Baking Show\n\nI live for The Great British Baking Show (known as The Great British Bake Off outside the US). When the sun starts setting at 4:30PM and seasonal affect starts disordering my life, I’m okay because I know that means it’s Baking Show season. This year, the show has done some interesting things with the format, trying new variations on the show’s technical challenge where bakers are tasked with making something with stripped-down directions. I wish the challenges weren’t so overly focused on sweets, but it’s always fun learning the absolutely bonkers names the Brits have for their pastries. There is no way in a logical world that an oatmeal bar like this should be called a flapjack — it doesn’t even flap! Honestly, yelling about how British English is Wrong is just as much fun as watching the amateur bakers themselves.\n\nThe first half of the final season of Stranger Things is out, and while we can quibble about whether or not it’s quality television, it is good for one specific reason: it is finally ending. The show started off really strong, telling a fun tale about kids saving the world from the adults that are trying to ruin it. But that kind of storytelling got lost in the near decade between the first season and now — even though the Duffer Brothers want us to believe that it’s only been four years since Will first went to the Upside Down. It’s okay that stories end, and I’m glad we’ve got the opportunity to end this show on a high note by returning focus to what made it so great in the first place — them meddling kids.\n\nSquid Game is another one of Netflix’s tentpole hits that has come to an end this year. Gi-hun / Player 456 (Lee Jung-jae) has returned to Mr. Beast’s Murder Island to expose the organizers of the deadly games once and for all. He’s befriended another crop of desperate people willing to do whatever for life-changing amounts of cash and just like in the first two seasons it’s brutal to watch the games destroy them one by one.\n\nDeath By Lightning\n\nClocking in at just under 200 days, James Garfield has the second shortest term of a US president, and I was genuinely enthralled watching Death By Lightning chart his rise to the office and tragic fall via an assassin’s bullet. As with Frankenstein, Netflix is once again on time with a metaphor appropriate for current events. Death By Lightning takes a look at how incendiary political discourse, like the kind fomented against Garfield by his own party, can lead to violence.\n\nBut more than the prescient political commentary, the performances make this show. Michael Shannon imbues Garfield with a salt-of-the-earth quality that makes you root hard for him. Shea Whigham has entered his character actor villain era playing New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, and Matthew “Mr. Darcy / Tom Wambsgans” Macfadyen gives a heartbreaking performance playing Garfield’s assassin Charles Guiteau.\n\nThe show’s best moments come from Nick Offerman as Garfield’s reluctant vice president, Chester A. Arthur. Offerman as Arthur is regency-era Ron Swanson. Throughout most of the show’s four episodes, Offerman is either drunk, fighting, raving about sausages, or a combination of all three. That man is having a blast chewing the scenery in a top hat and mutton chops, and I would genuinely watch a whole White House sitcom with him as the star.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-24T08:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T13:36:05.025987"}

Meanwhile, rank-and-file [&#8230;]", "content": "2025 was the year generative AI made its presence felt in the video game industry. Its use has been discovered in some of the most popular games of the year, and CEOs from some of the largest game studios claim it’s being implemented everywhere in the industry including in their own development processes. Meanwhile, rank-and-file developers, especially in the indie games space, are pushing back against its encroachment, coming up with ways to signal their games are gen-AI free.\n\nGenerative AI has largely replaced NFTs as the buzzy trend publishers are chasing. Its proponents claim that the technology will be a great democratization force in video game development, as gen AI’s ability to amalgamate images, text, audio, and video could shorten development times and shrink budgets — ameliorating two major problems plaguing the industry right now. In service to that idea, numerous video game studios have announced partnerships with gen-AI companies.\n\nReaction to this encroachment from both players and developers has been mixed. It seems like generally, players don’t like gen AI showing up in games. When gen-AI assets were discovered in Anno 117: Pax Romana, the game’s developer Ubisoft claimed the assets “slipped through” review and they were subsequently replaced. When gen-AI assets were found in Black Ops 7, however, Activision acknowledged the issue, but kept the images in the game. Critical response has also been lopsided. ARC Raiders was awarded low scores with reviewers specifically citing the use of gen AI as the reason. Clair Obscur, though, was nigh universally praised and its use of gen AI, however temporary, has barely been mentioned.\n\nIt seems like developers are sensitive to the public’s distaste for gen AI but are unwilling to commit to not using it. After gen-AI assets were discovered in Black Ops 7, Activision said it uses the tech to “empower” its developers, not replace them. When asked about gen AI showing up in Battlefield 6, EA VP Rebecka Coutaz called the technology seductive but affirmed it wouldn’t appear in the final product. Swen Vincke, CEO of Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian, said gen AI is being used for the studio’s next game Divinity but only for generating concepts and ideas. Everything in the finished game, he claimed, would be made by humans. He also hinted at why game makers insist on using the tech despite the backlash developers usually receive whenever it’s found.\n\n“This is a tech-driven industry, so you try stuff,” he told Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier in an interview. “You can’t afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you’re not using it, you’re dead.”\n\nComments from other CEOs reinforce Vincke’s point. Junghun Lee, the CEO of ARC Raiders’ parent company Nexon, said in an interview that, “It’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.”\n\nThe problem is, though, gen AI doesn’t yet seem to be the golden egg its supporters want people to believe it is. Last year, Keywords Studios, a game development services company, published a report on creating a 2D video game using only gen-AI tools. The company claimed that gen-AI tools can streamline some development processes but ultimately cannot replace the work of human talent. Discovering gen AI in Call of Duty and Pax Romana was possible precisely because of the low-quality of the images that were found. With Ubisoft’s interactive gen-AI NPCs, the dialogue they spout sounds unnatural and stilted. Players in the 2025 Chinese martial arts MMORPG Where Winds Meet are manipulating its AI chatbot NPCs to break the game, just like Fortnite players were able to make AI-powered Darth Vader swear.\n\nFor all the promises of gen AI, its current results do not live up to expectations. So why is it everywhere?\n\nOne reason is the competitive edge AI might but currently can’t provide that Swen Vincke alluded to in his interview with Bloomberg. Another reason is also the simplest: it’s the economy, stupid. Despite inflation, flagging consumer confidence and spending, and rising unemployment, the stock market is still booming, propped up by the billions and billions of dollars being poured into AI tech. Game makers in search of capital to keep business and profits going want in on that. Announcing AI initiatives and touting the use of AI tools — even if those tools have a relatively minor impact on the final product — can be a way to signal to AI-eager investors that a game company is worth their money.\n\nThat might explain why the majority of gen-AI’s supporters in gaming come from the C-suite of AAA studios and not smaller indie outfits who almost universally revile the tech. Indies face the same economic pressure as bigger studios but have far fewer resources to navigate those pressures. Ostensibly, indie developers are the ones who stand to benefit the most from the tech but, so far, are its biggest opponents. They are pushing back against the assertion that gen AI is everywhere, being used by everybody, with some marking their games with anti-AI logos proclaiming their games were made wholly by humans.\n\nFor some indie developers, using gen AI defeats the purpose of game making entirely. The challenge of coming up with ideas and solutions to development problems — the things gen AI is supposed to automate — is a big part of game making’s appeal to them. There are also moral and environmental implications indie developers seem especially sensitive to. Gen-AI outputs are cobbled from existing bodies of work that were often used without consent or compensation. AI data centers are notorious for consumptive energy usage and polluting their surrounding areas, which are increasingly focused in low-income and minority communities.\n\nWith its unrealized promises and so-far shoddy outputs, it’s easy to think of gen AI as gaming’s next flash in the pan the way NFTs were. But with gaming’s biggest companies increasingly reporting their use, gen AI will remain a lightning rod in game development — until the tech improves, or, like with NFTs, the bubble pops.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-24T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T13:36:05.239147"}

Here’s how to choose one that will suit your needs and budget.", "content": "Most people treat their monitor like a printer. They just want it to work without having to think about it. But if you work from home or spend hours gaming every night, it's worth an upgrade. And that's where things can get complicated. Do you pay extra for more ports? Or for a large display? How about something with smart features so it can double as a television—or springing for one of those flashy OLED monitors? Those are all worthwhile features, but don't splurge for the latest thing before you know what you're getting into.\n\nIf you're looking to upgrade from a basic 1080p monitor you've been using for a decade, I recommend buying the Dell 27 Plus 4K. It's sharp, has good colors, and is shockingly affordable. I knew right when I tested it that it would be unbeatable at its price, and I promise: I won't be offended if you skip all my words and buy that immediately. But if you're shopping around, I have advice ranging from panel types to refresh rate. Let's dive in.\n\nFor our full recommendations, check out our Best Monitors and Best Gaming Monitors guides.\n\nPanel Types\n\nFor more information on panel types, read our in-depth look at the tech that distinguishes these panel types from each other.\n\nLED\n\nThe standard type of monitor panel these days is still LED (light-emitting diodes), which refers to the way the screen is backlit. This isn't the brightest or most color-accurate type of panel, but it's grown into the cheapest and most widely accessible option. Within the category of LED backlighting, there are also a variety of LCD (liquid crystal display) types. IPS (in-plane switching) is the most common, while VA (vertical alignment) is still used in some cheaper creator-focused monitors, and TN (twisted nematic) is available in some lower-end gaming monitors. But IPS has become the standard.\n\nFortunately, there has been some development on IPS over the years, which improves various elements of the image quality. You'll see “IPS Black” in various LG or Dell monitors, which improves the contrast to closer to 2,000:1. There's even a second version of IPS Black (known as IPS Black 2.0 or Enhanced IPS Black) that claims to push contrast up to 3,000:1. I've also tested Nano IPS, another advanced version of IPS from LG that improves the color gamut. I've tested a 6K monitor that uses Nano IPS Black, combining them all together to produce one of the best IPS displays possible. As good as these are, though, they can't achieve the highs of more advanced forms of backlighting.\n\nOLED\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nOLED (organic light-emitting diodes) is the other primary option these days. For so long, it had been kept away from PC monitors and only used in televisions and smartphones.

Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.\n\nThe bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.\n\nCritics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines, and wind and solar projects on federal land.\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:30:59 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T13:36:06.467497"}

While it used to be just a boring animation of Santa’s sleigh and reindeer flying across a map, NORAD has added tons of features since then, such as fun mini-games, videos, stories, and Christmas music.\n\nRecently, NORAD’s Santa Tracker teamed up with OpenAI to introduce new AI-powered features. These include an image generator that transforms your selfie into an animated elf character, a tool for generating toy ideas and converting them into printable coloring book pages, and a fill-in-the-blank storytelling tool that allows families to add names, places, and other details to create a fun holiday story to read aloud.\n\nImage Credits: NORAD Image Credits:NORAD\n\nRather than a 2D model, the NORAD Santa tracker has a 3D visual depiction of Santa’s journey as the platform was built on Cesium’s open source 3D mapping library. It also uses Bing Maps satellite imagery, making the globe look more “realistic.”\n\nAlong with the tracker tool, users can also see a “Santa Cam,” which has videos of Santa making his way around the world to deliver presents to every kid on the nice list.\n\nNORAD’s website has Santa’s North Pole Village, which includes a holiday countdown, arcade-style games, kid-friendly music, an online library and various videos that can be watched on NORAD’s official YouTube channel.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.\n\nThe policy doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude are prohibited from being distributed via the API.\n\nThe European Commission this month also launched an investigation into the new policy, raising concerns that it may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Some games simply look better or run faster on the Pro than the base-model PS5, while others look better and run faster. That said, it’s worth noting that PS5 Pro lacks a disc drive and is thus limited to digital titles, though you can buy an optional drive for $80 if you want to attach one later.\n\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro has a bigger GPU than any other PS5 model, with twice as much internal storage as the current slim models (2TB versus 1TB). Another notable feature exclusive to the Pro is PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution), which uses AI to upscale graphics in supported games to produce a better-looking image.

In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers.\n\nA judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law’s enforcement that was set to take effect in January. The ruling was a win for tech giants and a setback to Texas lawmakers, who said the legal fight will continue. The Texas attorney’s general office noted in a court filing that it plans to appeal the decision, a report from Reuters noted.\n\nTo comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time.\n\nApple also said its Declared Age Range API, a technology the company debuted to help it comply with the growing number of age assurance laws worldwide, would be updated in the months ahead to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas. Apple had planned to launch new APIs for developers to request parental consent again if their app was significantly updated.\n\nApple had objected to this law, and similar laws arriving next year in Utah and Louisiana, on the grounds of privacy, not kids’ protection.\n\n“While we share the goal of strengthening kids’ online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores,” Apple explained in a developer announcement earlier this year.\n\nApple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its Declared Age Range API, Significant Change API under PermissionKit, New age rating property type in StoreKit, and App Store Server Notifications.

The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company’s egg producers. Both trim the company’s overhead.\n\nAt the same time, Mill’s bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.\n\nThe company started selling food waste bins to households a few years ago. As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliche — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the first and second generations.\n\n“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already using Mill in their homes when the two companies started talking.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

In the ensuing months, Whole Foods trialed the consumer version in some of its stores. Mill used feedback from Whole Foods to refine its commercial model.\n\nBut what helped sealed the deal was Mill’s ability to pinpoint food waste before it was wasted. Mill has developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry’s term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.\n\nAdvances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”\n\nThe use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue.\n\n“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you’re fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.”\n\nAnd it seems that Mill isn’t finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said its working on building out a municipal business as well.\n\n“We’re continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T15:46:11.433626"}

Waymo says it has used Gemini’s “world knowledge” to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios.\n\nWaymo is working on Gemini AI in-car assistant\n\n\n\nThey tried to hide it from the app, but here’s the full 1200-line system prompt pic.twitter.com/weh1EBPj7y — Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) December 24, 2025\n\nWong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider’s experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences.\n\nAccording to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider’s first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they’ve been on.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can’t control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It’s not something I can do yet.”\n\nInterestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot, and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn’t say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…”\n\nThe system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking.\n\nThe assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect.\n\n“Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system’s performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads.\n\nThe in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe’s closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies.\n\nWaymo isn’t the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. Tesla is doing something similar with xAI’s Grok. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:27:55 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T16:32:40.138989"}

But the actual data on the state of the region’s venture market shows a different reality.\n\nThe upshot: The European market has not recovered from the global venture capital reset that occurred in 2022 and 2023. But there is evidence it is on the cusp of a turnaround, including Klarna’s recent exit and the region’s homegrown AI startups garnering attention from local investors and beyond.\n\nInvestors poured €43.7 billion ($52.3 billion) into European startups in 2025 across 7,743 deals through the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. That means the yearly total is on pace to match — not exceed — the €62.1 billion invested in 2024 and €62.3 billion in 2023.\n\nIn comparison, U.S. venture deal volume in 2025 had already surpassed 2022, 2023, and 2024 by the end of the third quarter, according to PitchBook data.\n\nDeal recovery isn’t Europe’s biggest problem, though — it’s VC firm fundraising. Through Q3 2025, European VC firms raised a mere €8.3 billion ($9.7 billion), which puts Europe on track for its lowest overall fundraising yearly total in a decade.\n\n“Fundraising, LP to GP, is definitely the weakest area within Europe,” Navina Rajan, a senior analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “We’re on track for around 50% to 60% decline in the first nine months of this year. A lot of that is made up now by emerging managers versus experienced firms, and the mega funds that closed last year haven’t repeated this year.”\n\nWhile Rajan doesn’t share the same fever that oozed out of attendees at Slush, she pointed to a few positive data points that suggest the European market is turning around.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Rajan said that figure dipped to a low in 2023 when U.S.-based VCs participated in just 19% of European venture deals. It has been steadily on the rise since, she said.\n\n“They seem pretty optimistic on the European market,” Rajan said. “Just from an entry point of view, because you think about valuations, especially within AI tech and in the U.S., it’s just impossible to get in now, whereas, if you’re in Europe and your multiples are lower, and you’re new as an investor, it just provides a better entry point for perhaps similar tech.”\n\nSwedish vibe-coding startup Lovable is one example of this shift. Vibe-coding companies have raised a lot of VC money in the United States. But U.S. investors also clearly love Lovable. The company just announced a new $330 million Series B round that was both led by and participated in by a slew of U.S.-based VCs, including Salesforce Ventures, CapitalG, and Menlo Ventures, among others.\n\nFrench AI research lab Mistral has seen similar love from U.S.-based firms. Mistral landed a €1.7 billion Series C round in September that included Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, and Lightspeed.\n\nKlarna’s recent exit also suggests a turnaround is underway.\n\nSwedish fintech giant Klarna went public in September after raising $6.2 billion across two decades in the private market. That exit likely recycled some capital back to European LPs or gave them confidence in a changing exit environment.\n\nFor Victor Englesson, a partner at Swedish EQT, the recent European success stories, like Klarna, have started to change how founders in Europe approach building their companies.\n\n“Ambitious founders have seen what great looks like in companies like Spotify, Klarna, Revolut and are now starting companies with that type of ambition,” Englesson told TechCrunch. They’re not starting companies with like, I want to win in Europe, or I want to win in Germany. They start companies with a mindset that I want to win globally. I don’t think we have seen that to the same extent before.”\n\nThat mindset has EQT, and others, bullish on Europe.\n\n“For EQT, we’ve invested $120 billion in Europe [over the] last five years,” Englesson said. “We’re going to invest $250 billion [over the] next five years in Europe.

Long the invisible but critical backbone of the internet, server farms have rarely been a point of interest for folks outside of the tech industry, let alone an issue of particularly captivating political resonance.\n\nWell, as of 2025, it would appear those days are officially over.\n\nOver the past 12 months, data centers have inspired protests in dozens of states, as regional activists have sought to combat America’s ever-increasing compute buildup. Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, writes that there are currently 142 different activist groups across 24 states that are organizing against data center developments.\n\nActivists have a variety of concerns: the environmental and potential health impacts of these projects, the controversial ways in which AI is being used, and, most importantly, the fact that so many new additions to America’s power grid may be driving up local electricity bills.\n\nSuch a sudden populist uprising appears to be a natural response to an industry that has grown so quickly that it’s now showing up in people’s backyards. Indeed, as the AI industry has swelled to dizzying heights, so, too, has the cloud computing business. Recent US Census Bureau data shows that, since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed a stunning 331%. Spending on these projects totals in the hundreds of billions of dollars. So many new data centers have been proposed in recent months that many experts believe that a majority of them will not—and, indeed, could not possibly—be built.\n\nThis buildout shows no signs of slowing down in the meantime. Major tech giants—including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have all announced significant capital expenditure projections for the new year, a majority of which will likely go toward such projects.\n\nNew AI infrastructure isn’t just being pushed by Silicon Valley but by Washington D.C., where the Trump administration has made artificial intelligence a central plank of its agenda. The Stargate Project, announced in January, set the stage for 2025’s massive AI infrastructure buildout by heralding a supposed “re-industrialization of the United States.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nIn the process of scaling itself exponentially, an industry that once had little public exposure has suddenly been thrust into the limelight—and is now suffering backlash. Danny Candejas, an activist with the non-profit MediaJustice, has been personally involved in a number of actions against data centers, including a protest that took place in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, where locals came out to decry the expansion of Colossus, a project from Elon Musk’s startup, xAI.\n\nCandejas told TechCrunch that he meets new people every week who express interest in organizing against a data center in their community. “I don’t think this is going to stop anytime soon,” he said. “I think it’s going to keep building, and we’re going to see more wins—more projects are going to be stopped.”\n\nEvidence in support of Candeja’s assessment is everywhere you look. Across the country, communities have reacted to newly announced server farms in much the same way the average person might react to the presence of a highly contagious plague. In Michigan, for instance, where developers are currently eyeing 16 different locations for potential data center construction, protesters recently descended upon the state’s capitol, saying things like: “Michiganders do not want data centers in our yards, in our communities.” Meanwhile, in Wisconsin—another development hot spot—angry locals appear to have recently dissuaded Microsoft from using their town as a headquarters for a new 244-acre data center. In Southern California, the tiny city of Imperial Valley recently filed a lawsuit to overturn its county’s approval of a data center project, expressing environmental concerns as the rationale.\n\nThe discontent surrounding these projects has gotten so intense that politicians believe it could make or break particular candidates at the ballot box. In November, it was reported that rising electricity costs—which many believe are being driven by the AI boom—could become a critical issue that determines the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n“The whole connection to everybody’s energy bills going up—I think that’s what’s really made this an issue that is so stark for people,” Candejas told TechCrunch. “So many of us are struggling month to month. Meanwhile, there’s this huge expansion of data centers…[People are wondering] Where is all that money coming from? How are our local governments giving away subsidies and public funds to incentivize these projects, when there’s so much need in our communities?”\n\nIn some cases, protests appear to be working and even halting (if only temporarily) planned developments. Data Center Watch claims that some $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed as the result of grassroots opposition. Candejas is certainly a believer in the idea that organized action can halt companies in their tracks. “All this public pressure is working,” he said, noting that he could sense a “very palpable anger” around the issue.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the tech industry is fighting back. Earlier this month, Politico reported that a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been “distributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.” Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote.

Furthermore, a study of village dogs (free-roaming dogs living in or near human communities) from around the world found genetic traces of wolves in all 280 analyzed pups.\n\nDogs are thought to have evolved from populations of gray wolves, which became extinct during the Late Pleistocene epoch about 20,000 years ago. Although wolves and dogs still share habitats and can produce fertile offspring, interbreeding between the two has been thought to be extremely rare. Apart from deliberate breeding, there has been little evidence of genetic mixing since domestication.\n\n“Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can’t be very much wolf DNA present, if any,” explains Audrey Lynn, a postdoctoral fellow at the American Museum of Natural History who specializes in bioinformatics. “But we found if you look very closely in modern dog genomes, wolf is there.”\n\nGenomes Reveals Memories From 3,000 Years Ago\n\nLynn and her colleagues collected large-scale genome data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and used sensitive genomic methods such as local ancestry analysis (LAI) and phylogenetic analysis to study wolves, purebred canines, village dogs, and other canids from the late Pleistocene to the present. The research was conducted using highly sensitive genomic methods such as local ancestry estimation (LAI) and phylogenetic analysis.\n\nBy combining these advanced methods, the researchers were able to divide the entire genome into smaller sections, estimate the ancestry of each section, and capture minute amounts of gene flow that could not be detected using conventional statistical methods.\n\nThey found that the gene flow from wolves to dogs occurred on average about 1,000 generations ago (equivalent to about 3,000 years ago). In contrast, the gene flow from dogs to wolves was much more recent, concentrated around the beginning of the 19th century.

I dug through my toolbox and found a shorter screwdriver, which made screwing in the 16 screws a whole affair. Yet I persevered and placed the white polished-enamel fireplace in my living room.\n\nI pushed the power button, and an almost cartoon-like LED version of a fire appeared. I sat on my sofa and opened my laptop to work. An hour later, I woke up to the sound of my dryer buzzer. I had taken a rare, unintended hour-long nap.\n\nGood to Glow\n\nPhotograph: Lisa Wood Shapiro\n\nCourtesy of Home Depot Chevron Chevron Turbro Suburbs 25 in. Wi-Fi-Enabled Electric Fireplace $200 Home Depot\n\nI would not describe myself as someone who naps. After the births of my three children, I never napped when they napped. I also struggle with the basics: rest and relaxation. That is why when I stood up at seven o’clock that evening, I eyed the electric fireplace and wondered if its simulacrum of fire, the flickering orange and red flames, glow of burning logs, and crackle sounds had bewitched me into that restful catnap. I admit that at times, my suspension of disbelief can be a force. I fall for the ventriloquist's illusion of the puppet being able to speak simply because the ventriloquist's mouth does not appear to move. Maybe the fake fireplace is exactly the illusion my nervous system craves.\n\nTurbro’s Suburbs isn’t the first ventless fireplace I’ve tested, but it was the first model that truly promoted rest and possible recovery, the kind that lowers one’s blood pressure. The 32-pound Suburbs is light enough that I can pick up what is essentially a 2-by-2-foot box and move it around my home all by myself. When I opened the fireplace's SmartLife app, which was already on my phone for another smart appliance, the Suburbs was already there on the dashboard.\n\nVideos: Lisa Wood Shapiro\n\nThe app’s remote control is easier to maneuver than the fireplace's clunky and confusing physical remote. There are three brightness settings for the flame, and it comes with a realistic crackling fire sound that can be adjusted to three different volume settings. Lastly, the Suburbs white enameled wood-burning stove design has an infrared heater that can also be scheduled on a timer. It was able to effectively warm up my 200-square-foot living room.\n\nIt's Only Natural\n\nAs I tested the Suburbs, I began to think of it as my relaxation box. Regulating my mood, decompressing from stress, and striving toward an actual moment of rest are all priorities in my self-aware life. What if the mimicry of a real fireplace was responsible for reducing very real stress? Like forest bathing, could the simulation of fire elicit a calming response because a wood fire is natural?\n\nResearchers have studied the psychological benefits of watching a fire. Christopher D. Lynn, professor and graduate director of anthropology at the University of Alabama, has studied the impact of viewing fire on blood pressure. His research found that “consistent blood pressure decreases in the fire-with-sound condition, particularly with a longer duration of stimulus.”\n\nI reached out by email to ask if he found similar results to a real fire as he did with a simulated fire, like a television Yule log. He wrote back that he “replicated our original study using an electric fireplace with funding from Napoleon Fireplaces and found results similar to the original study.” Lynn is working on getting that paper published. Earlier research has linked watching a real flame fireplace with higher cognitive function.\n\nAnd while there is some research that differentiates between the benefits of a real flame versus those of the fake flame, simulated fireplaces do not cause indoor air pollution. A simulated fire is the healthier choice, and it might even help with brain function. This entire piece was written calmly, in a low-stress environment, in front of the Suburbs electric fireplace. It comes with a two-year warranty (once registered) and costs around $200, an amount of money that I would argue should be paid for out of one's flexible spending account (FSA).", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:33:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T10:49:16.210244"}

But the companies controlling who fixes their stuff aren’t giving up that power willingly.", "content": "It has been a big year for the right to repair, the movement of advocates pushing for people to be able to fix their own electronics and equipment without manufacturer approval. The issue has gathered broad support from technologists, farmers, military leaders, and politicians on both sides of the aisle. It is popular with just about everyone—except the companies who stand to gain if the parts, instructions, and tools necessary to fix their products remain under lock and key.\n\nThree US states passed right-to-repair laws this year, including in heavily Republican states like Texas where the measure received a unanimous vote in both the House and Senate. Repair advocates are planning to continue that push into 2026 and beyond, applying pressure to legislators in an attempt to give gearheads more options when it comes to the gadgets they use every day. It marked a big shift for the right-to-repair movement, which has been lobbying for decades to allow users to repair their gadets—from iPhones to laptops—without going back to the manufacturer or voiding the warranty by taking it to an unauthorized repair shop.\n\nexpired: rubbish tired: recycle wired: repair Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\n“The fundamental problem with restricting the right to repair is that when you buy equipment, you have a competitive market,” says Nathan Proctor, senior director of the campaign for the right to repair at the United States Public Interest Research Group. “Once you have the equipment, if the manufacturer can make the repair a proprietary process, there's no competition at all.”\n\nWhile the right to repair has broad support around the world—Canada and the EU, among others, have passed laws and issued rulings in consumers’ favor—the US often finds itself the focal point of the movement. For years advocates have been pushing for federal laws to let people change their phone’s battery or fiddle with their tractor without running afoul of what manufacturers will allow. Despite bipartisan support, nothing has come to pass, which is why this year’s state-level laws were so important.\n\nFor many advocates, the right to repair is an environmental issue. People are less inclined to throw gear into landfills if they can fix it. While some companies have gotten better about owning up to their environmental impacts by, say, switching to cardboard or recyclable materials for packaging, efforts to make the products themselves recyclable have been slower coming. That’s begun to change. Even a company like Apple, long resistant to letting people tweak their own iPhones, has begrudgingly started offering self-repair options to its customers. So, too, has Google, which redesigned its Pixel Watch to make it more repairable after pressure from repair advocates.\n\nDespite these victories, companies continue to find ways to dance around regulations, obfuscate repair manuals, and make some repair tools available to customers only in certain states. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, which offers how-to guides and sells gadget repair kits, says the next big step after 2025’s legislative wins will be making sure companies are following the new laws. “We’re seeing different levels of malicious compliance from different companies,” Wiens says.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T11:22:58.211613"}

The next generation is thinner, more transparent, and folds in half. That’s a good thing.", "content": "This was a surprisingly fun year for smartphones. I wasn’t expecting it to be; the category is often described as stale or “plateaued.” But as WIRED’s resident phone reviewer, I’ve tested nearly all of this year’s handsets—devices as cheap as $130 all the way to an eye-watering $2,000—and I don’t think there’s been a year filled with as many varied styles in quite some time.\n\nIt all started with the Nothing Phone (3a) series, which the UK company launched at Mobile World Congress early in the year. While I wasn’t a fan of the Pro model’s top-heavy camera module, the electric blue Phone (3a) is a standout. It looks like no other smartphone on the market, with a transparent backplate, a pop of color from a small red square, and the company’s signature Glyph lights, which blink when you receive notifications. Those LEDs may not be the most useful, but they’re fun and wacky.\n\nexpired: dumb phones tired: vanilla phones wired: wacky phones Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nThat whimsical design has been sorely lacking for several years. Remember 2020’s LG Wing? The five-camera Nokia 9 PureView from 2019? The weird Moto Mods of a decade ago, which added things like cameras and speakers to the Moto Z from Motorola? These phones may not have topped the charts, but they tried something different.\n\nSmartphones are a necessity in today’s world, and like all commodities, that means good and playful designs are often sacrificed for the sake of manufacturing efficiency. When companies chase the bottom line, we end up with plain, simple-looking phones designed for the broadest possible audience. This is why the recent shift to devices with a little more character feels significant.\n\nNothing had another win on its hands this year with the CMF Phone 2 Pro, a sub-$300 phone that didn’t look or feel anything like its budget price. Uniquely, you can unscrew the back of the phone and replace the backplate with one that’s a different color, or take off the Accessory Point module and attach things like a lanyard. Sustainability-focused Fairphone had a similar idea with The Fairphone (Gen. 6), except this smartphone did all of that while also achieving a 10/10 repairability score from iFixit.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (3a). Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Motorola Razr 2025 series. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nNext came Motorola, which has seen a lot of success in recent years with its Razr folding flip phones. With the 2025 Razr models, the company leaned heavily into different materials and textures. You could buy a Razr with a back coated in the microfiber textile Alcantara, vegan leather, or polished black Gorilla Glass. There’s even a version with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It helps that Motorola remains one of the only manufacturers offering a folding flip phone under $700. (It even gets as low as $600 during sale events.)\n\nYou may still be hesitant to invest in one of these hinge-reliant handsets, given their spotty history with durability, but they are tougher than ever. I’ve dropped multiple Razrs, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and even the Galaxy Z Flip7 this year, and outside of minor scuffs on the frame, none of them have cracked. Motorola introduced a titanium-reinforced hinge plate this year. Google promises 10-plus years of folding for its latest Fold and has finally earned an IP68 rating for its folding design. Samsung says its Galaxy Z Fold7 can withstand 500,000 folds, which pencils out to more than a decade of typical use.\n\nWe should expect more out of how the gadgets in our lives look and feel. As with a good watch, I find that I genuinely enjoy using devices that put a little more care or effort into design and build quality. This year, I was delighted by the sharp-looking Light Phone III—the anti-smartphone that doesn’t run traditional apps—whereas the Minimal Phone, which is built with the same goal of helping reduce time spent staring at a screen, had a plasticky build that felt off-putting. Even with all of this experimentation in form, you don’t have to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on a good-looking phone. Motorola’s Moto G Stylus 5G has a striking design with a lovely leather-like texture, and it’s frequently on sale for $300.\n\nThe Light Phone III. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Moto G Stylus 5G 2025. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThin, as always, was also very much in. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge and the iPhone Air may not be original ideas, but I kid you not, holding an ultrathin and lightweight phone is actually pretty dang awesome. Unfortunately—and unsurprisingly—Samsung’s design suffered from lackluster battery life, and while the iPhone Air delivered better-than-expected run times, its single camera system and high price didn’t exactly scream good value in an economically tumultuous year. (These flaws likely explain the rumors that suggest Samsung has canceled plans for a successor to its thinnest handset and that Apple has been weathering lackluster sales of the Air.)\n\nBut we’ve already seen the benefits of thinner phones. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold7 is one of the best folding phones of the year, in large part due to the massive reduction in size and weight over its predecessors. Apple is also rumored to be working on a folding iPhone, and the learnings from the iPhone Air would go a long way in making a device that’s not cumbersome to hold.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T11:22:58.881738"}

For years now, the entertainment industry has used different kinds of generative AI products for a variety of post-production processes ranging from de-aging actors to removing green screen backgrounds. In many instances, the technology has been a useful tool for human artists tasked with tedious and painstaking labor that might have otherwise taken them inordinate amounts of time to complete. But in 2025, Hollywood really began warming to the idea of deploying the kind of gen AI that’s really only good for conjuring up text-to-video slop that doesn’t have all that many practical uses in traditional production workflows. Despite all of the money and effort being put into it, there’s yet to be a gen-AI project that has shown why it’s worth all of the hype.\n\nThis confluence of Hollywood and AI didn’t start out so rosy. Studios were in a prime position to take the companies behind this technology to court because their video generation models had clearly been trained on copyrighted intellectual property. A number of major production companies including Disney, Universal, and Warner Bros. Discovery did file lawsuits against AI firms and their boosters for that very reason. But rather than pummeling AI purveyors into the ground, some of Hollywood’s biggest power players chose instead to get into bed with them. We have only just begun to see what can come from this new era of gen-AI partnerships, but all signs point to things getting much sloppier in the very near future.\n\nThough many of this year’s gen-AI headlines were dominated by larger outfits like Google and OpenAI, we also saw a number of smaller players vying for a seat at the entertainment table. There was Asteria, Natasha Lyonne’s startup focused on developing film projects with “ethically” engineered video generation models, and startups like Showrunner, an Amazon-backed platform designed to let subscribers create animated “shows” (a very generous term) from just a few descriptive sentences plugged into Discord. These relatively new companies were all desperate to legitimize the idea that their flavor of gen AI could be used to supercharge film / TV development while bringing down overall production costs.\n\nAsteria didn’t have anything more than hype to share with the public after announcing its first film, and it was hard to believe that normal people would be interested in paying for Showrunner’s shoddily cobbled-together knockoffs of shows made by actual animators. In the latter case, it felt very much like Showrunner’s real goal was to secure juicy partnerships with established studios like Disney that would lead to their tech being baked into platforms where users could prompt up bespoke content featuring recognizable characters from massive franchises.\n\nThat idea seemed fairly ridiculous when Showrunner first hit the scene because its models churn out the modern equivalent of clunky JibJab cartoons. But in due time, Disney made it clear that — crappy as text-to-video generators tend to be for anything beyond quick memes — it was interested in experimenting with that kind of content. In December, Disney entered into a three-year, billion-dollar licensing deal with OpenAI that would let Sora users make AI videos with 200 different characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and more.\n\nNetflix became one of the first big studios to proudly announce that it was going all-in on gen AI. After using the technology to produce special effects for one of its original series, the streamer published a list of general guidelines it wanted its partners to follow if they planned to jump on the slop bandwagon as well. Though Netflix wasn’t mandating that filmmakers use gen AI, it made clear that saving money on VFX work was one of the main reasons it was coming out in support of the trend. And it wasn’t long before Amazon followed suit by releasing multiple Japanese anime series that were terribly localized into other languages because the dubbing process didn’t involve any human translators or voice actors.\n\nAmazon’s gen-AI dubs became a shining example of how poorly this technology can perform. They also highlighted how some studios aren’t putting all that much effort into making sure that their gen AI-derived projects are polished enough to be released to the public. That was also true of Amazon’s machine-generated TV recaps, which frequently got details about different shows very wrong. Both of these fiascos made it seem as if Amazon somehow thought that people wouldn’t notice or care about AI’s inability to consistently generate high-quality outputs. The studio quickly pulled its AI-dubbed series and the recap feature down, but it didn’t say that it wouldn’t try this kind of nonsense again.\n\nDisney-provided examples of its characters in Sora AI content. Image: Disney\n\nAll of this and other dumb stunts like AI “actress” Tilly Norwood made it feel like certain segments of the entertainment industry were becoming more comfortable trying to foist gen-AI “entertainment” on people even though it left many people deeply unimpressed and put off. None of these projects demonstrated to the public why anyone except for money-pinching execs (and people who worship them for some reason) would be excited by a future shaped by this technology.\n\nAside from a few unimpressive images, we still haven’t seen what all might come from some of these collaborations, like Disney cozying up to OpenAI. But next year AI’s presence in Hollywood will be even more pronounced. Disney plans to dedicate an entire section of its streaming service to user-generated content sourced from Sora, and it will encourage Disney employees to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT products. But the deal’s real significance in this current moment is the message it sends to other studios about how they should move as Hollywood enters its slop era.\n\nRegardless of whether Disney thinks this will work out well, the studio has signaled that it doesn’t want to be left behind if AI adoption keeps accelerating. That tells other production houses that they should follow suit, and if that becomes the case, there’s no telling how much more of this stuff we are all going to be forced to endure.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-25T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T13:36:10.737316"}

She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.\n\nWhen your kid starts showing a preference for one of their stuffed animals, you’re supposed to buy a backup in case it goes missing.\n\nI’ve heard this advice again and again, but never got around to buying a second plush deer once “Buddy” became my son’s obvious favorite. Neither, apparently, did the parents in Google’s newest ad for Gemini.\n\nIt’s the fictional but relatable story of two parents discovering their child’s favorite stuffed toy, a lamb named Mr. Fuzzy, was left behind on an airplane. They use Gemini to track down a replacement, but the new toy is on backorder. In the meantime, they stall by using Gemini to create images and videos showing Mr. Fuzzy on a worldwide solo adventure — wearing a beret in front of the Eiffel tower, running from a bull in Pamplona, that kind of thing — plus a clip where he explains to “Emma” that he can’t wait to rejoin her in five to eight business days. Adorable, or kinda weird, depending on how you look at it! But can Gemini actually do all of that? Only one way to find out.\n\nI fed Gemini three pictures of Buddy, our real life Mr. Fuzzy, from different angles, and gave it the same prompt that’s in the ad: “find this stuffed animal to buy ASAP.” It returned a couple of likely candidates. But when I expanded its response to show its thinking I found the full eighteen hundred word essay detailing the twists and turns of its search as it considered and reconsidered whether Buddy is a dog, a bunny, or something else. It is bananas, including real phrases like “I am considering the puppy hypothesis,” “The tag is a loop on the butt,” and “I’m now back in the rabbit hole!” By the end, Gemini kind of threw its hands up and suggested that the toy might be from Target and was likely discontinued, and that I should check eBay.\n\n‘I am considering the puppy hypothesis’\n\nIn fairness, Buddy is a little bit hard to read. His features lean generic cute woodland creature, his care tag has long since been discarded, and we’re not even 100 percent sure who gave him to us. He is, however, definitely made by Mary Meyer, per the loop on his butt. He does seem to be from the “Putty” collection, which is a path Gemini went down a couple of times, and is probably a fawn that was discontinued sometime around 2021. That’s the conclusion I came to on my own, after about 20 minutes of Googling and no help from AI. The AI blurb when I do a reverse image search on one of my photos confidently declares him to be a puppy.\n\nGemini did a better job with the second half of the assignment, but it wasn’t quite as easy as the ad makes it look. I started with a different photo of Buddy — one where he’s actually on a plane in my son’s arms — and gave it the next prompt: “make a photo of the deer on his next flight.” The result is pretty good, but his lower half is obscured in the source image so the feet aren’t quite right. Close enough, though.\n\nThe ad doesn’t show the full prompt for the next two photos, so I went with: “Now make a photo of the same deer in front of the Grand Canyon.” And it did just that — with the airplane seatbelt and headphones, too. I was more specific with my next prompt, added a camera in his hands, and got something more convincing.\n\nLooks plausible enough. Image: Gemini / The Verge Safety first, Buddy. Image: Gemini / The Verge\n\nI can see how Gemini misinterpreted my prompt. I was trying to keep it simple, and requested a photo of the same deer “at a family reunion.” I did not specify his family reunion. So that’s how he ended up crashing the Johnson family reunion — a gathering of humans. I can only assume that Gemini took my last name as a starting point here because it sure wasn’t in my prompt, and when I requested that Gemini created a new family reunion scene of his family, it just swapped the people for stuffed deer. There are even little placards on the table that say “deer reunion.” Reader, I screamed.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n1 / 2 I’m pretty sure I’ve seen this family in a pharmaceutical commercial before. Image: Gemini / The Verge\n\nFor the last portion of the ad, the couple use Gemini to create cute little videos of Mr. Fuzzy getting increasingly adventurous: snowboarding, white water rafting, skydiving, before finally appearing in a spacesuit on the moon addressing “Emma” directly. The commercial whips through all these clips quickly, which feels like a little sleight of hand given that Gemini takes at least a couple of minutes to create a video. And even on my Gemini Pro account, I’m limited to three generated videos per day. It would take a few days to get all of those clips right.\n\nGemini wouldn’t make a video based on any image of my kid holding the stuffed deer, probably thanks to some welcome guardrails preventing it from generating deepfakes of babies. I started with the only photo I had on hand of Buddy on his own: hanging upside down, air-drying after a trip through the washer. And that’s how he appears in the first clip it generated from this prompt: Temu Buddy hanging upside down in space before dropping into place, morphing into a right-side-up astronaut, and delivering the dialogue I requested.\n\nA second prompt with a clear photo of Buddy right-side-up seemed to mash up elements of the previous video with the new one, so I started a brand new chat to see if I could get it working from scratch. Honestly? Nailed it. Aside from the antlers, which Gemini keeps sneaking in. But this clip also brought one nagging question to the forefront: should you do any of this when your kid loses a beloved toy?\n\nI gave Buddy the same dialogue as in the commercial, using my son’s name rather than Emma. Hearing that same manufactured voice say my kid’s name out loud set alarm bells off in my head. An AI generated Buddy in front of the Eiffel Tower? Sorta weird, sorta cute. AI Buddy addressing my son by name? Nope, absolutely not, no thank you.\n\nHow much, and when, to lie to your kids is a philosophical debate you have with yourself over and over as a parent. Do you swap in the identical stuffie you had in a closet when the original goes missing and pretend it’s all the same? Do you tell them the truth and take it as an opportunity to learn about grief? Do you just need to buy yourself a little extra time before you have that conversation, and enlist AI to help you make a believable case? I wouldn’t blame any parent choosing any of the above. But personally, I draw the line at an AI character talking directly to my kid. I never showed him these AI-generated versions of Buddy, and I plan to keep it that way.\n\nNope, absolutely not, no thank you.\n\nBut back to the less morally complex question: can Gemini actually do all of the things that it does in the commercial? More or less. But there’s an awful lot of careful prompting and re-prompting you’d have to do to get those results. It’s telling that throughout most of the ad you don’t see the full prompt that’s supposedly generating the results on screen. A lot depends on your source material, too. Gemini wouldn’t produce any kind of video based on an image in which my kid was holding Buddy — for good reason! But this does mean that if you don’t have the right kind of photo on hand, you’re going to have a very hard time generating believable videos of Mr. Sniffles or whoever hitting the ski slopes.\n\nLike many other elder millennials, I think about Calvin and Hobbes a lot. Bill Watterson famously refused to commercialize his characters, because he wanted to keep them alive in our imaginations rather than on a screen. He insisted that having an actor give Hobbes a voice would change the relationship between the reader and the character, and I think he’s right. The bond between a kid and a stuffed animal is real and kinda magical; whoever Buddy is in my kid’s imagination, I don’t want AI overwriting that.\n\nThe great cruelty of it all is knowing that there’s an expiration date on that relationship. When I became a parent, I wasn’t at all prepared for the way my toddler nuzzling his stuffed deer would crack my heart right open. It’s so pure and sweet, but it always makes me a little sad at the same time, knowing that the days where he looks for comfort from a stuffed animal like Buddy are numbered. He’s going to outgrow it all, and I’m not prepared for that reality. Maybe as much as we’re trying to save our kids some heartbreak over their lost companion, we’re really trying to delay ours, too.\n\nAll images and videos in this story were generated by Google Gemini.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-25T09:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T14:27:19.383350"}

But the challenge of defeating it sparked Quintero’s passion for cybersecurity, eventually leading him to found VirusTotal, a startup that Google acquired in 2012. That acquisition brought Google’s flagship European cybersecurity center to Málaga, transforming the Spanish city into a tech hub.\n\nAll because of a small malware program created by someone whose identity Quintero had never known.\n\nMoved by nostalgia and gratitude, Quintero launched a search earlier this year. He asked Spanish media outlets to amplify his quest for tips. He dove back into the virus’s code, looking for clues his 18-year-old self might have missed. And he eventually solved the mystery, sharing the bittersweet resolution in a LinkedIn post that went viral.\n\nThe story begins in 1992, when a young Quintero was prompted by a teacher to create an antivirus for the 2610-byte program that had spread across the computers of Málaga’s Polytechnic School. “That challenge in my first year at university sparked a deep interest in computer viruses and security, and without it my path might have been very different,” Quintero told TechCrunch.\n\nQuintero’s search was aided by his programmer instincts. Earlier this year, he stepped down from his team manager role to “go back to the cave, to the basement of Google.” He didn’t leave the company; instead, he went back to tinkering and experimenting without managerial duties.\n\nThat tinkering mindset also led him to reexamine Virus Málaga and look for details that his 18-year-old self would have missed. First, he found fragments of a signature, but thanks to another security expert, he discovered a later variant of the virus with a much clearer cue: “KIKESOYYO.” “Kike soy yo” would translate to “I am Kike,” a common nickname for “Enrique.”\n\nAround the same time, Quintero received a direct message from a man who is now the general digital transformation coordinator for the Spanish city of Cordoba and who claimed he witnessed one of his Polytechnic School classmates created the virus. Many details added up, but one stood out in particular: he knew that the virus’s hidden message — called a payload, in cybersecurity terms — was a statement condemning the Basque terrorist group ETA, a fact that Quintero had never disclosed.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

To his family, he was Kike.\n\nCancer took away Antonio Enrique Astorga before Quintero could thank him in person, but the story doesn’t stop here. Quintero’s LinkedIn post sheds new light to the legacy of “a brilliant colleague who deserves to be recognized as a pioneer of cybersecurity in Málaga” — and not just for helping Quintero discover his vocation.\n\nAccording to his friend, Astorga’s virus had no other goal than spreading his anti-terrorist message and proving himself as a programmer. Mirroring Quintero’s path, Astorga’s interest in IT endured, and he became a computing teacher at a secondary school that named its IT classroom after him in his memory.\n\nAstorga’s legacy also lives on beyond these walls, and not just through his students. One of his sons, Sergio, is a recent software engineering graduate with an interest in cybersecurity and quantum computing — a meaningful connection for Quintero. “Being able to close that circle now, and to see new generations building on it, is deeply meaningful to me,” Quintero said.\n\nFor Quintero, who suspects their paths will cross again, Sergio is “very representative of the talent being formed in Málaga today.” This, in turn, is a result of VirusTotal forming the root of what eventually became the Google Safety Engineering Center (GSEC) and spearheading collaborations with the University of Málaga that made the city a true cybersecurity talent hub.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T18:40:42.375702"}

Learn more.\n\nOne Battle After Another\n\nIf you want to get a head start on watching the movies that are sure to earn the greatest number of Oscar nominations, One Battle After Another is a great place to start. The film, which is set over the span of nearly two decades, tells the story of revolutionary-turned-stoner Bob Ferguson (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has given up his activist ways in order to protect his daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti, in a powerful feature debut). But Bob’s historic acts of civil disobedience are still top-of-mind for the deranged Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw (Sean Penn, in one of his best of many great roles), who is determined to track him down. It’s yet another triumph for writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, both in terms of its scope and unexpected pitch-black humor.\n\nIt’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley\n\nOscar nominee Amy Berg (Deliver Us From Evil) is one of today’s foremost documentarians, and this loving tribute to Jeff Buckley proves why. Nearly three decades after his shocking and premature death, Berg delves into not just the life and artistry of the singer, but the profound impact of his music. Though Buckley died at the age of 30 with few recordings to his name, he remains a beloved icon. The documentary is packed with never-before-seen footage of Buckley and interviews with those who knew and loved him.\n\nSpinal Tap II: The End Continues\n\nIn 1984, the late Rob Reiner pivoted his career from Emmy-winning actor to iconic filmmaker with This Is Spinal Tap, a film that essentially invented the mockumentary genre that remains so popular to this day. More than 40 years later, his career came full circle with this long-awaited sequel that sees the members of the world’s greatest fake rock band—David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer)—reunite for a concert, with documentarian Marty DiBergi (Reiner) ready to capture all of the hilarious chaos, and tiny little Stonehenges, once again. Make it a night full of laughs, and a tribute to Reiner, by watching the original film, which is also streaming, first.\n\nMaterialists\n\nLucy (Dakota Johnson) is a professional matchmaker in New York City who is great at her job but not as lucky in her own love life. When she suddenly finds herself in the middle of a love triangle with two men—Harry (Pedro Pascal), a suave and wealthy broker who is everything Lucy has ever dreamed of, and John (Chris Evans), her aspiring actor ex—she is finally forced to figure out whether ticking every box in a nebulous list of must-haves is truly the answer to finding one’s perfect match. Celine Song, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind 2023’s Past Lives (also streaming on HBO), treats the topic with intelligence and respect.\n\nEddington\n\nAri Aster took a break from psychological thrillers like Hereditary to craft this Covid-themed neo-western. Set in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the film follows the everyday challenges of a small-town sheriff, Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), who believes he’s doing what’s best to keep his townspeople safe. After butting heads with the town’s mayor, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), he decides to run for Garcia’s job himself. But in a town rife with misinformation and mounting tensions, the race gets more intense than he ever imagined.\n\nOne to One: John & Yoko\n\nOn August 30, 1972, three years after quietly informing his fellow Beatles that he was leaving the band, John Lennon and wife Yoko Ono headlined two shows of the One to One concert, a charity event which raised more than $1.5 million for kids with developmental disabilities and featured additional performers including Stevie Wonder, Roberta Flack, and Sha Na Na. This documentary from Oscar-winning filmmaker Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September) offers an up-close glimpse at John and Yoko’s lives at this time, having recently relocated to New York City and as they navigated the music industry in a post-Beatles world. It’s an intimate experience, like few docs before it.\n\nThoughts and Prayers\n\nIn 2025 alone, there have been dozens of instances of gun violence in schools in the US. In order to help teachers and students prepare for this new reality, a new business—active-shooter preparedness—has popped up in its wake and is making millions. This captivating new documentary goes inside the industry, delving into both the financial and psychological implications of turning our schools into tactical training grounds.\n\nWeapons\n\nZach Cregger announced his arrival as a unique voice in the horror genre with 2022’s twisted, and twisty, Barbarian. He cemented that reputation again in 2025 with Weapons. When 17 kids from the same third-grade class go missing in the middle of the night in a sleepy Pennsylvania town, the residents—and police—are baffled. When suspicions fall on the classroom’s teacher, Miss Gandy (Ozark’s Julia Garner), she sets out on her own to figure out what happened. Like Barbarian, it’s an intriguing premise made all the more compelling by superb acting from Garner, Josh Brolin, and Alden Ehrenreich—yet with unexpected hits of humor, and savagery, that keep your eyes glued to the screen until the very end.\n\nSorry, Baby\n\nEva Victor made their name as a comedic tour de force with their viral sketch videos, which gained a massive following on social media. Among Victor’s fans: Oscar-winning filmmaker Barry Jenkins (Moonlight), who slid into Victor’s DMs with an offer to take a look at anything they might be looking to turn into a feature-length movie. The result is Sorry, Baby, Victor’s feature directorial debut. Agnes (Victor) is a literature professor struggling to heal from a traumatic event that has left her world upended. Despite the bleak subject matter, Victor infuses the film with the brutally honest and often hilarious tone that has defined their comedy sketches. The film was a hit on the festival circuit, screening at both Cannes and Sundance, where it nabbed Victor the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award.\n\nPrime Minister\n\nVery little about Jacinda Ardern's tenure as prime minister of New Zealand could be described as quotidian. She became the country's opposition party leader just weeks before election day. After she won she discovered she was pregnant and gave birth while still in office, one of very few heads of state in history to do so. During her tenure she navigated the Covid-19 lockdowns and the Christchurch mosque shooting. This documentary, directed by Michelle Walshe and Lindsay Utz, chronicles her meteoric rise, resignation, and life after her time in office.\n\nBring Her Back\n\nA24’s partnership with HBO continues to ensure that a never-ending stream of fascinating new(ish) indies from around the globe find their way into the network's streaming library. Bring Her Back is a totally deranged Australian horror film starring two-time Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins in what might be her most unhinged performance yet. Following the death of their father, teen step-siblings Andy (Billy Barratt) and Piper (Sora Wong) are sent to live in a foster home with Laura (Hawkins), an odd but seemingly well-meaning older woman who is also currently tending to a young mute boy named Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips). But Andy comes to learn that Laura is harboring some serious trauma of her own—and that he and his fellow foster kids are part of a wild plan to restore normalcy to Laura’s life. The movie takes viewers to dark, unexpected, and often gruesome places as it dissects the power that trauma can have over our lives.\n\nThe Witch\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy was a 19-year-old Hollywood newcomer when she delivered her breakthrough performance as Thomasin, the young daughter of a family that is banished from its Puritan community in 1630s New England and forced to live in solitude in the wilderness. Soon they begin experiencing a series of eerie encounters that they believe to be supernatural in origin—and they very well may be right. The film, which burns slowly but brilliantly toward a conclusion that rewards viewers’ patience, marked the feature directorial debut of writer/director Robert Eggers, who has gone on to wide acclaim for similarly moody flicks like The Lighthouse (2019), The Northman (2022), and Nosferatu (2024).\n\nShame\n\nTwo years before nabbing the first of two (and counting) Oscar nominations for his work on Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave, Michael Fassbender and McQueen collaborated on the criminally underseen Shame. To be fair: the film’s NC-17 rating certainly didn’t help its chances at becoming a box office behemoth, but the controversial rating was necessary in order for McQueen to deliver such a raw and honest portrayal of addiction. Brandon Sullivan (Fassbender) is a handsome and powerful executive living the good life in New York City, all while attempting to hide a debilitating sex addiction that has quickly taken over every part of his life. But when Brandon’s sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) shows up at his apartment unexpectedly, she forces him to confront the ties—and trauma—that bind them.\n\nFriendship\n\nPaul Rudd and Tim Robinson both do what they do best—be impossibly likable and incredibly unhinged, respectively—in this dark comedy bromance. Craig Waterman (I Think You Should Leave’s Robinson) is an awkward marketing executive who is surprised when his new neighbor Austin Carmichael, a local TV meteorologist, invites him over for a beer one night. The two strike up an unexpected friendship that has the typically homebound Craig seeing the world in a whole new way—one filled with guys’ nights and male bonding. But when Austin decides to call off their brewing brotherhood, Craig cannot handle the rejection. And will go to wild lengths to mend their relationship.\n\nFinal Destination Bloodlines\n\nTwenty-five years after Final Destination arrived in theaters, and more than a decade after the last installment, the newest entry in the so-bad-it’s-good horror franchise just delivered what is undoubtedly its best chapter. While the story follows the same plot that fans have come to know and love—a group of people manage to cheat death, so Death comes back to finish the job—this one gives some history to that familiar rubric. While that gives this entry a more emotional level, it’s also quite clever in the new ways it chooses to off those whose fate was predetermined. And while it’s gory as hell, there’s something subtly comedic about the whole affair.\n\nSinners\n\nHot on the heels of some of the best, and most successful Marvel movies ever (that would be the Black Panther films), writer-director Ryan Coogler found a whole new way to blow cinephiles' minds with this gorgeous vampire tale. Set in 1930s Mississippi, the film stars Michael B. Jordan in a dual role as twin brothers Smoke and Stack, two World War I veterans who return home from Chicago with mob money with a plan to run a juke joint. Opening night of their new establishment, however, goes terribly wrong when a group of blood-sucking white musicians shows up at their door. Lush and full of beautifully shot action scenes, Sinners is already at the top of many critics' Best of 2025 lists and has scored seven Golden Globe nominations. In addition to the original theatrical release, HBO Max is streaming the film in Black American Sign Language (BASL).\n\nGet Out\n\nIn 2017, Jordan Peele went from one half of Key & Peele to an Oscar-winning screenwriter (not to mention the first Black writer to win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the first Black filmmaker to be nominated as a producer, writer, and director in one year). Nearly a decade later, the impact of Peele’s Get Out is still just as impressive. Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has been invited by his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), to spend the weekend at her parents’ home in upstate New York. While Chris worries that her seemingly upper-class parents won’t be accepting of an interracial relationship, Rose assures him it won’t be a problem—and she’s right, but for all the wrong reasons. With Get Out, Peele cracked the code on making a film that was a horror movie, psychological drama, and telling commentary on race all at once.\n\nMountainhead\n\nSuccession creator Jesse Armstrong just might be today’s foremost chronicler of the world’s 1 percent. He stays in that lane with Mountainhead, his feature directorial debut, which follows an unexpectedly eventful weekend gathering of four of the tech world’s most powerful men at the new mountain retreat of Hugo “Souper” Van Yalk (Jason Schwartzman), the only non-billionaire of the bunch. While it’s meant to be a friendly get-together between old pals, everyone has an ulterior motive for blocking the weekend on their calendar. But all plans go out the window when the social media platform owned by Ven Parish (Cory Michael Smith), the world’s richest man, sends the world into upheaval as the result of a fast-tracked AI feature that’s spreading disinformation at an alarming rate. Which everyone but Ven sees as an opportunity to increase both their power and net worth.\n\nBabygirl\n\nRomy Mathis (Nicole Kidman) is a high-powered CEO with a husband (Antonio Banderas) who does not excite her and two teenage daughters she adores. But her life is turned upside down when one morning, while walking to her office, she is nearly attacked by a dog. A handsome young stranger (Harris Dickinson) steps in and manages to avert the attack, which leaves Romy shaken—and curious. Later, that same young man is introduced to her as Samuel, one of her newest interns, who seems to keep finding ways to push the boundaries of appropriate workplace behavior. Eventually, Romy gives in to Samuel’s advances, and his taste for BDSM-ish kink. Despite Romy’s concerns about the unfair power dynamic, Samuel insists that he’s the one who holds the power in their relationship, as she is the one with everything to lose. He might be right about that.\n\nThe Brutalist\n\nAdrien Brody earned his second Best Actor Oscar for this historical epic from director Brady Corbet about László Tóth (Brody), a Bauhaus-trained architect who emigrates to America after surviving the Buchenwald concentration camp. Tóth settles in the Philadelphia area and must rebuild his life by working menial jobs for little pay. But Tóth’s talents don’t go hidden for long. A wealthy industrialist, Harrison Lee Van Buren (Guy Pearce), learns about Tóth’s past and commissions him to design a huge project. He also helps to speed up the immigration of Tóth’s wife, Erzsébet (Felicity Jones), whom he has not seen since his incarceration. But Tóth soon learns that the American Dream comes at a price. While, at its heart, The Brutalist is a frank depiction of the immigrant experience, it’s also a heartbreaking statement on the pain that comes with processing trauma. The film won three of its 10 Oscar nominations, and is completely deserving of each.\n\nHouse\n\nPrepare to have your mind blown by this trippy 1977 horror-comedy from Japan. Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami) is the daughter of a famed film composer who returns from a trip to Italy with a surprise: a new wife. In an effort to avoid the awkwardness of the situation, she asks her aunt if she can stay at her creepy old mansion for the summer, then brings along six of her closest friends. It doesn’t take long for weird things to start happening. Disembodied head attacks, homicidal pianos, and possessed cat portraits? This thrillingly bonkers cult classic has it all!\n\nGimme Shelter\n\nLegendary documentarians Albert and David Maysles reinvented the rockumentary with this riveting first-hand recounting of the final days of the Rolling Stones’ 1969 US tour, which led to their infamous Altamont Free Concert. The concert, which attracted an estimated 300,000 people to California’s Altamont Speedway on December 6, 1969, was a disaster from the get-go—especially given the band’s decision to bring in the Hells Angels as the show’s security (one member famously said they were reportedly paid in beer). The Stones weren’t the only artists, but by the time they took the stage the crowd was out of control. At one point, one of the Angels stabbed a man, Meredith Hunter, right in front of the stage—a moment that the filmmakers later realized they had captured on film. Seeing the band’s reaction to watching the footage themselves makes for a truly compelling perspective on rock stardom.\n\nSing Sing\n\nColman Domingo proves yet again why he is one of today’s most acclaimed actors with this Oscar-nominated performance. Divine G (Domingo) is an inmate at New York’s infamous Sing Sing prison, serving time for a crime he did not commit. During his imprisonment, he finds purpose and joy in the prison’s theater group, part of its (very real) Rehabilitation Through the Arts program. By tapping into his inner thespian, Divine G is able to connect with his emotions, and he becomes determined to prove his innocence. But his undeniable acting talent, which inspires some of his fellow inmates, ends up posing a problem when it comes time for a parole hearing. Ultimately, Divine comes to respect the transformative power of the arts in helping him and some of his fellow inmates to overcome their past traumas. Making the film even more powerful is the fact that many of the actors are formerly incarcerated men who took part in the program.\n\nHeretic\n\nHugh Grant earned some much-deserved awards consideration for playing so far against type in this religion-themed psychological thriller. Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) are two young Mormon missionaries who are desperate to find someone—anyone—who will let them speak about their religion in an attempt to convert new members to the church. When Mr. Reed (Grant), a seemingly kind older man, invites them into his home in order to deliver their spiel to him and his wife, it quickly becomes apparent, at least to Sister Barnes, that something is amiss. And that Reed doesn’t so much want to hear about religion as he does talk about it—and force his own beliefs on the young women in increasingly bizarre, and deadly, ways.\n\nWe Live in Time\n\nAndrew Garfield and Florence Pugh ignite the screen with their chemistry in this romantic tearjerker that follows the couple over the course of a decade, from their meet-not-so-cute (she hits him with her car) to their journey into parenthood and, eventually, facing the ultimate curveball that threatens their happily-ever-after. Garfield and Pugh are two of the most acclaimed actors of their generation, and We Live in Time proves why.\n\nJuror #2\n\nUp until now, most of what you’ve heard about Juror #2 is how it’s one of Clint Eastwood’s most accomplished directorial efforts—and yet somehow it got shafted when it came to its theatrical release. Now’s your chance to see what all the fuss is about. Justin Kemp (Nicholas Hoult) is a journalist and recovering alcoholic who is making every effort to maintain his sobriety. That becomes a bit of a challenge when he’s put on the jury of a high-profile murder trial … only to realize that he may have inadvertently played a part in what happened. Hoult is fantastic in this edge-of-your-seat legal (and ethical) drama.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nIt has been nearly 40 years since Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice stormed the late ’80s box office. In the decades since, we’ve often heard rumblings that a sequel was in the works. Or might be in the works. Or most definitely was in the works. Or might not be in the cards at all. Well, in 2024 it finally happened, and it was as if Michael Keaton had never stepped away from the role at all (eternal life has a way of doing that to you). This time, however, Lydia (Winona Ryder) is still doing her best to forget her rendezvous with the bio-exorcism pro. But when she returns to her childhood home, it’s her own badass daughter (Jenna Ortega) who finds a way to bring him back into all their lives.\n\nSuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story\n\nIn addition to the all-new Superman movie, audiences have James Gunn and his DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran (partly) to thank for bringing this long-overdue documentary about the ultimate superhero actor to worldwide audiences. Directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui deliver a heartfelt, moving tribute to Reeve—as an actor, yes, but even more so as a person who never gave up. Alexandra Reeve Givens, Matthew Reeve, and Will Reeve—Reeve’s children—share their own stories about their dad, giving the project yet another layer of intimacy. No, you’re crying.\n\nWatchmen: Chapter I\n\nBrandon Vietti (Batman: Under the Red Hood) directs this innovative animated adaption of Alan Moore’s Hugo Award-winning graphic novel about an investigation into the murder of Edward Blake—better known as a superhero named the Comedian. When the police come up empty in terms of suspects, the costumed vigilante Rorschach (Titus Welliver) decides to take the case into his own hands, and eventually comes to believe that someone is attempting to knock off superheroes. So he enlists the help of a group of them in order to put a stop to the killing spree.\n\nMaXXXine\n\nMaXXXine is the third film in writer-director Ti West’s X trilogy, which began with X and Pearl. It’s set immediately after the events of Pearl: Mia Goth’s Maxine Minx is desperate to escape her upbringing as a preacher’s daughter and make the move from porn to more mainstream movies. She gets her chance when she lands the lead in a horror movie, The Puritan II. Then her friends start getting murdered. Ultimately, Maxine is forced to confront the sins of her past and find a way to achieve the fame she so desperately dreams of.\n\nCivil War\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, the United States has transformed into an all-out battlefield between an authoritarian government, headed by a third-term president (Nick Offerman), and a stream of secessionist movements that threaten to destroy the country as we know it. But a group of journalists (led by Kirsten Dunst) is determined to document the downfall of America at any cost, so they set about heading to the White House in order to interview the embattled president. Which is much easier said than done. Oscar nominee Alex Garland (Ex-Machina) writes and directs this dystopian drama that often hits uncomfortably close to home.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\n\nFuriosa may have been dubbed a box office “bomb” when it arrived in theaters, but don’t let those dollar-focused headlines deter you from this one. Anya Taylor-Joy, who is undoubtedly one of the most versatile actors working today, shines in the role of Imperator Furiosa, a badass emancipator who dares to challenge gender conventions in a dangerous, postapocalyptic world where (no surprise at all) men make the rules. Taylor-Joy does an admirable job embracing the role that Charlize Theron memorably originated in Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nFaye\n\n“I’m Faye Dunaway. That’s who I am.” That’s the way the Oscar winner introduces herself in the trailer for Laurent Bouzereau’s feature-length documentary. But what the film reveals is that there’s a lot more to Faye Dunaway than the glamorous image associated with the legendary star of Network. Dunaway opens up in a way that has rarely been seen before, discussing her childhood and family, her struggles with bipolar disorder, and how the characters she has played continue to impact her. It’s a fascinating portrait of a true Hollywood icon.\n\nQuad Gods\n\nJess Jacklin’s feature documentary follows the fascinating journey of Blake, Prentice, and Richard—three individuals with quadriplegia who meet in a neuro-rehabilitation lab at Mount Sinai Hospital and launch a plan to create the world’s first all-quadriplegic esports team. It’s a noble pursuit, but one fraught with challenges as they break down the doors of ableism. At its heart, Quad Gods is a story of friendship, perseverance, and survival.\n\nAm I OK?\n\nLucy (Dakota Johnson) is a thirtysomething living in Los Angeles, constantly failing at relationships and wondering why she doesn’t have everything figured out yet. After drunkenly sharing the story of the time she kissed a female friend as a teen, she begins to realize that the problem in her love life might not be the men she’s choosing, but that she’s choosing men at all. Former Saturday Night Live writer Lauren Pomerantz penned the script for the film based on her own experience of coming out in her thirties. Tig Notaro and her wife Stephanie Allynne do an admirable job as codirectors, treating Lucy’s journey of self-discovery with the respect it deserves—and plenty of humor.\n\nMoviePass, MovieCrash\n\nFor better or worse, millions of film fans will remember 2012 as the year of MoviePass. For $25 per month, you could basically live in a movie theater—which was great for audiences, not so great for movie theaters (which were already struggling), and eventually disastrous for the company itself. For anyone who still has their MoviePass, this revealing documentary tells the real story of all that went wrong behind the scenes, and shares the story of the unsung heroes who really did just want to create a product that movie lovers could embrace. By the way: If you do indeed still have your original MoviePass, this doc has made it a worthwhile piece of memorabilia—with some selling for north of $1,000.\n\nDune and Dune: Part Two\n\nSince breaking through with the Oscar-nominated Incendies (2010), Denis Villeneuve has continued to prove that he’s one of the most talented filmmakers working today. As if making a Blade Runner sequel that didn’t suck wasn’t enough, Villeneuve then went on to crack the cinematic code on Frank Herbert’s Dune series—something that true visionaries like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky had attempted before him, albeit largely unsuccessfully. Both the 2021 original film and its sequel are streaming on HBO Max. The film follows the fate of the planet Arrakis—and its supply of melange, a unique spice and the most valuable substance in the universe—which rests in the hands of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the untested son of a powerful duke. Looking for more Dune action? The prequel series Dune: Prophecy, starring Emily Watson, Olivia Williams, and Mark Strong is streaming in full.\n\nBarbie\n\nGreta Gerwig is a master of breathing new life into old properties (see: Little Women). With Barbie, she has ignited a revolution. Barbie (Margot Robbie) is living her best life in Barbieland—until one day, when her perfectly plastic world, and heels, suddenly begin to collapse. To get her fabulous life back, Barbie must travel to the real world—well, Los Angeles—to determine who or what is causing her existential crisis. The film grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, meaning you've already seen it. But even if you did, it’s absolutely worth a second watch—if only to lament its many Oscar snubs.\n\nReality\n\nIn 2017, an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election was leaked anonymously. One year later, former NSA translator Reality Winner (yes, that’s her real name) was sentenced to more than five years in prison for the crime—the longest sentence ever received by a government whistleblower. Sydney Sweeney shines in this gripping true story, which plays out mostly in real time as the FBI knocks on the 25-year-old’s door and spends more than an hour questioning her.\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed\n\nFinding success in one’s lifetime might seem like the dream of every artist, but Nan Goldin has bigger ambitions. Though she’s a photographer by trade, she’s an activist by calling and has long used her camera to capture painfully intimate moments of America in crisis, including extensive work focused on the HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics. But All the Beauty and the Bloodshed reveals the artist in conflict: Should she allow her work to be showcased in one of the prominent museums or galleries that have received endowments from the Sackler family—the Big Pharma family that many blame for America’s opioid crisis? It’s a moving portrait of an artist willing to risk it all for her beliefs.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T20:29:44.623423"}

{"title": "HP ZBook 8 Gli 14-Inch Review: An Unimpressive Workstation", "link": "https://www.wired.com/review/hp-zbook-8-gli-14-inch/", "summary": "Billed as a workstation (and priced accordingly), HP’s Zbook 8 falls short of dazzling.", "content": "The concept behind the portable workstation isn’t a new or particularly challenging one. Load up a laptop with top-tier specs to make it as powerful and future-proof as possible, and never mind if it adds a few ounces and inches to the load. Ostensibly, these machines are designed with heavy grind tasks in mind, such as video editing or CAD work. Money has historically been no object with the mobile workstation. If you needed this kind of juice, it was expected that you (or, more likely, your employer) would have to pay for it.\n\nHP’s new ZBook 8 G1i checks off all those boxes, though it arrived with a curious twist: A deep discount of more than $2,500 off an over-$4,000 asking price, dramatically bringing the price of the machine down to something in line with a traditional laptop. I’m listening.\n\nPhotograph: Chris Null\n\nThick as a Brick\n\nIf it weren’t for the extra girth (27 mm) and weight (3.8 pounds), this laptop would easily pass for any old 14-inch system. (It’s also available in a 16-inch version.) It’s anonymous otherwise, and little thought has been given to industrial design here. Standard HP branding is affixed to a metallic gray chassis composed of partially recycled aluminum and plastic. Gently rounded corners do little to conceal the surprisingly wide bezels around the display, and the keyboard and trackpad are perfectly functional if utilitarian in appearance. If you’d been handed this machine on your first day of work in 2014, you’d probably be pretty jazzed.\n\nMobile workstations are all about the specs, and to that end, the ZBook 8 is rather surprising. While the inclusion of 64 GB of RAM is on point, the choice of CPU—an Intel Core Ultra 7 265H—is odd, landing just about in the middle of the Core Ultra Series 2 power spectrum. At the very least, it seems like an Ultra 9 would be in order. A 1-terabyte SSD was included in my test configuration. The screen size of 2560 x 1600 pixels is fine for a 14-inch (non-touchscreen) device, but shy of anything I’d consider dazzling.\n\nDiscrete graphics—common for a workstation—are present, but the system includes an Nvidia GeForce RTX 500 Ada Generation GPU, a niche processor I’ve never actually encountered in the wild. Nearly two years old, the 500 Ada is a stripped-down version of the GeForce RTX 4060. Benchmarks peg its performance as roughly on par with the mobile GeForce GTX 1000 series.

William Teer, then head of the far-right Texas Three Percenters militia, wrote a letter to Trump offering his help. Homan even met with an affiliate of the Proud Boys after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed. According to reports about the meeting, they discussed deportations.\n\nDespite all of these militia leaders and far-right extremist groups salivating at the prospect of being deployed to the streets of American cities to round up immigrants at gunpoint, the call never came.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has remade the federal government so completely that it has no need for far-right formations from outside the government to traumatize and terrorize immigrant communities across the country. Instead, it is relying on a vastly increased federal force encompassing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), FBI and DEA agents, state and local law enforcement officers, and others. This newly enlarged force is emboldened not only by a massive influx of cash but also by tacit approval from the White House to do whatever it feels is necessary to meet Trump’s wild deportation goals.\n\n“What we’re seeing right now is the Trump administration effectively realigning the federal government to support mass deportation,” says Nayna Gupta, policy director at the American Immigration Council. “This has meant diverting law enforcement resources from several agencies that have never before been involved with low-level immigration arrests, so that they are now focused only on profiling and arresting immigrants.”\n\nAs devastating as the past 12 months have been for immigrant communities in the US, experts believe the worst is yet to come. Installing CBP, which has a documented history of alleged human rights violations, as the agency at the forefront of the immigration crackdown is a deeply worrying sign, they say.\n\n“I think we’re just at the beginning,” says Naureen Shah, director of government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union. “I think we ain’t seen nothing yet.

On the Sleep Number app, I found it concerning that most of the time, my Sleep Score numbers were not as high as I thought they would be—my average for the three-week test period was a 74.\n\nShipping Services range from $150-$350; look for sales specials with free shipping promotions Sleep Trial 100-night trial Warranty 15-year limited warranty Certifications CertiPur-certified memory foam\n\nMatrix Mattress\n\nIf you prefer a remote, that's either a separate cost ($50) or potentially a different bed altogether. The only way to operate this mattress is by creating an account and downloading the app in advance. Security of one’s personal data is top of mind for many, and I wanted to know how the vast quantities of data accumulated by Sleep Number’s customer base were managed. When you first sign up for your account, you can either share your data with Sleep Number or opt out altogether. For those who share their data willingly—about 550,000 individuals, according to Mills—Sleep Number's data science team performs research and presents findings from its consumer base at major sleep conferences, including SLEEP and World Sleep Congress.\n\nIt's a comprehensive data set to work with, and it continues to evolve through the adaptive AI at play, which includes SleepIQ technology. According to Mills, the company's AI models are structured to analyze sleepers at an individual level, because every sleeper has a different build, age, pain issues, and various needs. According to Sleep Number's privacy policy, the company doesn't sell your information to third parties, and you can withdraw your consent to share information at any time. At the end of the day, Sleep Number is a business that can potentially use your data to develop new products, and it's up to you whether that's worth it or not.\n\nPower Couple\n\nAn adjustable base is what enables each side of the mattress to independently adjust head and foot angles. I tested the FlexFit 3 adjustable base alongside the P6 mattress, which is Sleep Number’s top-of-the-line offering. It offers timed foot warming (which takes about two minutes to heat up and has a two-hour default setting) to help blood flow away from your core and aid faster sleep. There is also a zero-gravity setting, partner snore (elevates the head and neck slightly to help open up airways), and motion-detect underbed lighting. I loved the gentle light source for late-night bathroom breaks, and the split king adjustability allowed me to partake in late-night reading without disturbing my partner. However, the only feature that separates the FlexFit 2 base from the FlexFit 3 is the inclusion of foot warming, and it’s a $400 upcharge for a queen size.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:32:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T11:42:37.693773"}

A tariff is a tax paid by consumers, and if there’s one thing the past four years have taught us, it’s that the public will not forgive a politician who presides over a period of rising prices, no matter what the cause.\n\nLuckily for the political fortunes of the world’s leaders, there is a better way to respond to tariffs. Tit-for-tat tariffs are a 19th-century tactic, and we live in a 21st-century world—a world where the most profitable lines of business of the most profitable US companies are all vulnerable to a simple legal change that will make things cheaper for billions of people, all over the world, including in the US, at the expense of the companies whose CEOs posed with Trump on the inaugural dais.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.\n\nIn 2026, countries that want to win the trade war have a unique historical possibility: They could repeal their “anticircumvention” laws, which make it illegal—a felony, in many cases—to modify devices and services without permission from their manufacturers. Over the past two decades, the office of the US Trade Representative–which is responsible for developing and coordinating US international trade, commodity, and direct investment policy—has pressured most of the world into adopting these laws, hamstringing foreign startups that might compete with Apple (by providing a jailbreaking kit that installs a third-party app store), or Google (by blocking tracking on Android devices), or Amazon (by converting Kindle and Audible files to formats that work on rival apps), or John Deere (by disabling the systems that block third-party repairs), or the Big Three automakers (by decoding the encrypted error messages mechanics need to service our cars). The rents that these digital locks help American companies extract run to hundreds of billions of dollars every single year. The world’s governments agreed to protect this racket in exchange for tariff-free access to American markets. Now that the US has reneged on its side of the bargain, these laws serve no useful purpose.\n\nUS tech giants (and giant US companies that use tech) have used digital locks to amass a vast hoard of ill-gotten wealth. In 2026, the first country bold enough to raid that hoard gets to transform hundreds of billions in US rents into hundreds of millions in domestic profits that launch its domestic tech sector into a stable orbit—and the remaining hundreds of billions will be reaped by all of us, everyone in the world (including Americans who buy gray-market jailbreaking tools from abroad), as a consumer surplus.\n\nIn 2026, many countries will respond to tariffs like they were still in the 19th century. But a few countries will have the vision, the boldness, and the political smarts to kick Donald Trump right in the dongle. The country that gets there first will enjoy the same relationship to, say, third-party app stores for games consoles, that Finland enjoyed in relation to mobile phones during the Nokia decade.\n\nThere are many countries with the technical nous to pull this off. Obviously, Canada and Mexico have pride of place, since Trump has torn up the USMCA agreement he arm-twisted them into in 2020, and heaped racist rhetoric on Mexico even as he threatened to annex Canada. Speaking of annexation targets with sizable communities of technical experts, the Danes could lead the EU out of the wilderness the bloc bargained its way into when they enacted Article 6 of the Copyright Directive in 2001. Then there's the global south: African tech powerhouses like Nigeria, South American giants like Brazil, and the small, developed Central American states who've seen Trump renege on the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), like Costa Rica.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T11:42:37.927020"}

Interesting though the year was for big, fancy cameras, perhaps the most anticipated new camera of the year is the little, unassuming Ricoh GR IV.\n\nThe GR series has been the pocket point-and-shoot to have for years, going all the way back to when it was a film camera. I'm happy to report that the latest addition to the storied lineup continues the tradition. But then you probably already know that, because you probably preordered one back when they were announced.

All of these cameras have flaws, and yet they are the most compelling cameras I've used in over 10 years of testing cameras for WIRED.

Madness or brilliance?", "content": "But you already know about this, because F g is what normies call an object’s “weight,” and for a given volume, weight depends only on the density. Now, if you dropped these blocks in a lake, obviously the styrofoam would float and the steel would sink. So clearly it has something to do with density.\n\nWhat if you had a block of water with the same volume? If you could somehow hold this cube of water, it would feel pretty heavy, about 62.4 pounds. Now, if you place it carefully in a lake, will it sink or bob on the surface like styrofoam? Neither, right? It’s just going to sit there.\n\nSince it doesn’t move up or down, the total force on the block of water must be zero. That means there has to be a force counteracting gravity by pushing up with equal strength. We call this buoyancy, and for any object, the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the water it displaces.\n\nSo let’s think about this. The steel block displaces the same amount of water, so it has the same upward-pushing buoyancy force as the block of water. But because it’s denser and has more mass, down it goes.\n\nIn general, an object will sink if the gravitational force exceeds the buoyancy force, and it will float if the buoyancy force exceeds the gravitational force. Another way of saying that is, an object will sink if it’s denser than water and it will float if it’s less dense.\n\nAnd right in the middle an object will neither sink nor rise to the surface—we call that neutral buoyancy. Humans are pretty close to neutral because our bodies are 60 percent water. That’s why you feel weightless underwater—the buoyancy force pretty much offsets the gravitational force.\n\nAvast! Hold on there, matey. Aircraft carriers are made of steel and weigh 100,000 tons, so why do they float? Can you guess? It’s because of their shape. Unlike a block of steel, a ship’s hull is hollow and filled with air, so it has a large volume relative to its weight.\n\nBut what if you start filling it with cargo? The ship gets heavier, which means it must displace more water to reach that equilibrium point. In general, when you launch a boat or ship into the water, it’ll sink down until the weight of the water it pushes aside equals the boat’s total weight.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T12:53:44.938380"}

While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year’s list of Ars’ favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the “expected” side of this year’s list.\n\nBut the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best Geometry Wars clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.\n\nAs we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed Grand Theft Auto VI chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows\n\nUbisoft Quebec; Windows, MaxOS, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, iPad\n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted—and expected—virtually every game I played to blow me away with something I’d not seen before. It was easier to hit that bar in the ’90s, when both the design and technology of games were moving at an incredible pace.\n\nNow, as someone who still games in his 40s, I’m excited to see that when it happens, but I don’t expect it, Now, I increasingly appreciate games that act as a sort of comfort food, and I value some games as much for their familiarity as I do their originality.\n\nThat’s what Assassin’s Creed Shadows is all about (as I wrote when it first came out).

Happy holidays!\n\nEver since 1993, I think I’ve unconsciously judged almost every game by how well it can capture how Wing Commander: Privateer made me feel.\n\nSteam and PlayStation (the two platforms I use the most) have been doing a year-in-review summary akin to the wildly popular Spotify Wrapped for the past few years. Based on these, I can report that my most-played games in 2025 were, from most hours down:\n\nNo Man’s Sky Civilization VII Assassin’s Creed Shadows The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind World of Warcraft Meridian 59 Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon Unreal Tournament\n\nWith the exceptions of Civilization VII and Unreal Tournament, every one of those games is some kind of open-world experience that’s all about immersing you in a far-flung land (or galaxy).\n\nI like what I like, and my knowing that’s what I like began in the early 1990s with Wing Commander: Privateer.\n\nPrivateer taught me that I love games that are spaces for living out whatever fictional life I create for myself much more than I love games that are guiding me through an authored story and a series of carefully designed challenges.\n\nYes, it has a story and story missions, but they’re hardly the point, partly because they’re not really that good. What’s exciting about this game is exploring new systems, seeing the beautiful CG artwork for their settlements, learning about your ships’ capabilities and upgrading them slowly over time, and attaining mastery of the pseudo-simulated economy.\n\nCredit: GOG These CG-rendered planet backgrounds captured my imagination in the 1990s, and they still do, though nostalgia probably plays a part.\n\nThe story that matters in Privateer is the story I am telling myself in my head. To this day, the games I most love offer at least a taste of that experience.\n\nPrivateer‘s far-reaching (and drama-laden) legacy\n\nTo say this game was influential on later titles would be an understatement, but we, of course, have to acknowledge that this formula was originally popularized by 1984’s Elite. Privateer just married that formula with Wing Commander‘s universe and flight mechanics, with a far more hand-crafted setting. That setting is key, though.

That means it’s time for us to celebrate the best cybersecurity stories we didn’t publish. Since 2023, TechCrunch has looked back at the best stories across the board from the year in cybersecurity.\n\nIf you’re not familiar, the idea is simple. There are now dozens of journalists who cover cybersecurity in the English language. There are a lot of stories about cybersecurity, privacy, and surveillance that are published every week. And a lot of them are great, and you should read them. We’re here to recommend the ones we liked the most, so keep in mind that it’s a very subjective and, at the end of the day, incomplete list.\n\nAnyway, let’s get into it. — Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai.\n\nEvery once in a while, there’s a hacker story that as soon as you start reading, you think it could be a movie or a TV show. This is the case with Shane Harris’ very personal tale of his months-long correspondence with a top Iranian hacker.\n\nIn 2016, The Atlantic’s journalist made contact with a person claiming to work as a hacker for Iran’s intelligence, where he claimed to have worked on major operations, such as the downing of an American drone and the now-infamous hack against oil giant Saudi Aramco, where Iranian hackers wiped the company’s computers. Harris was rightly skeptical, but as he kept talking to the hacker, who eventually revealed his real name to him, Harris started to believe him. When the hacker died, Harris was able to piece together the real story, which somehow turned out to be more incredible than the hacker had led Harris to believe.\n\nThe gripping story is also a great behind-the-scenes look at the challenges cybersecurity reporters face when dealing with sources claiming to have great stories to share.\n\nIn January, the U.K. government secretly issued Apple with a court order demanding that the company must build a backdoor so police can access iCloud data of any customer in the world. Due to a worldwide gag order, it was only because The Washington Post broke news that we learned the order existed to begin with. The demand was the first of its kind, and — if successful — would be a major defeat for tech giants who have spent the past decade locking themselves out of their users’ own data so they can’t be compelled to provide it to governments.\n\nApple subsequently stopped offering its opt-in end-to-end encrypted cloud storage to its customers in the U.K. in response to the demand. But by breaking the news, the secret order was thrust into the public eye and allowed both Apple and critics to scrutinize U.K. surveillance powers in a way that hasn’t been tested in public before. The story sparked a months-long diplomatic row between the U.K. and the United States, prompting Downing Street to drop the request — only to try again several months later.\n\nThis story was the sort of fly-on-the-wall access that some reporters would dream of, but The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief got to play out in real-time after he was unwittingly added to a Signal group of senior U.S. government officials by a senior U.S. government official discussing war plans from their cell phones.\n\n‘We are currently clean on OPSEC,” said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. they were not. Image Credit: The Atlantic (Screenshot)\n\nReading the discussion about where U.S. military forces should drop bombs — and then seeing news reports of missiles hitting the ground on the other side of the world — was confirmation that Jeffrey Goldberg needed to know that he was, as he suspected, in a real chat with real Trump administration officials, and this was all on-the-record and reportable.\n\nAnd so he did, paving the way for a months-long investigation (and critique) of the government’s operational security practices, in what was called the biggest government opsec mistake in history. The unraveling of the situation ultimately exposed security lapses involving the use of a knock-off Signal clone that further jeopardized the government’s ostensibly secure communications.\n\nBrian Krebs is one of the more veteran cybersecurity reporters out there, and for years he has specialized in following online breadcrumbs that lead to him revealing the identity of notorious cybercriminals. In this case, Krebs was able to find the real identity behind a hacker’s online handle Rey, who is part of the notorious advanced persistent teenagers‘ cybercrime group that calls itself Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters.\n\nKrebs’ quest was so successful that he was able to talk to a person very close to the hacker — we won’t spoil the whole article here — and then the hacker himself, who confessed to his crimes and claimed he was trying to escape the cybercriminal life.\n\nIndependent media outlet 404 Media has accomplished more impact journalism this year than most mainstream outlets with vastly more resources. One of its biggest wins was exposing and effectively shuttering a massive air travel surveillance system tapped by federal agencies and operating in plain sight.\n\n404 Media reported that a little-known data broker set up by the airline industry called the Airlines Reporting Corporation was selling access to five billion plane tickets and travel itineraries, including names and financial details of ordinary Americans, allowing government agencies like ICE, the State Department, and the IRS to track people without a warrant.\n\nARC, owned by United, American, Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, and other airlines, said it would shut down the warrantless data program following 404 Media’s months-long reporting and intense pressure from lawmakers.\n\nThe killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024 was one of the biggest stories of the year. Luigi Mangione, the chief suspect in the killing, was soon after arrested and indicted on charges of using a “ghost gun,” a 3D-printed firearm that had no serial numbers and built in private without a background check — effectively a gun that the government has no idea exists.\n\nWired, using its past reporting experience on 3D-printed weaponry, sought to test how easy it would be to build a 3D-printed gun, while navigating the patchwork legal (and ethical) landscape. The reporting process was exquisitally told, and the video that goes along with the story is both excellent and chilling.\n\nDOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, was one of the biggest running stories of the year, as the gang of Elon Musk’s lackeys ripped through the federal government, tearing down security protocols and red tape, as part of the mass-grab of citizens’ data. NPR had some of the best investigative reporting uncovering the resistance movement of federal workers trying to prevent the pilfering of the government’s most sensitive data.\n\nIn one story detailing a whistleblower’s official disclosure as shared with members of Congress, a senior IT employee in the National Labor Relations Board told lawmakers that as he was seeking help investigating DOGE’s activity, he “found a printed letter in an envelope taped to his door, which included threatening language, sensitive personal information and overhead pictures of him walking his dog, according to the cover letter attached to his official disclosure.”\n\nAny story that starts with a journalist saying they found something that made them “feel like shitting my pants,” you know it’s going to be a fun read. Gabriel Geiger found a dataset from a mysterious surveillance company called First Wap, which contained records on thousands of people from around the world whose phone locations had been tracked.\n\nThe dataset, spanning 2007 through 2015, allowed Geiger to identify dozens of high profile people whose phones were tracked, including a former Syrian first lady, the head of a private military contractor, a Hollywood actor, and an enemy of the Vatican. This story explored the shadowy world of phone surveillance by exploiting Signalling System No. 7, or SS7, an obscurely named protocol long known to allow malicious tracking.\n\nSwatting has been a problem for years. What started as a bad joke has become a real threat, which has resulted in at least one death. Swatting is a type of hoax where someone — often a hacker — calls the emergency services and tricks the authorities into sending an armed SWAT team to the home of the hoaxer’s target, often pretending to be the target themselves, and pretending they are about to commit a violent crime.\n\nIn this feature, Wired’s Andy Greenberg put a face on the many characters who are part of these stories such as the call operators who have to deal with this problem. And he also profiled a prolific swatter, known as Torswats, who for months tormented the operators and schools all over the country with fake — but extremely believable — threats of violence, as well as a hacker who took it upon himself to track Torswats down.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T14:28:35.671887"}

This year, the streaming service delivered several strong installments to some of its biggest series like Reacher, Fallout, and Invincible — but it also premiered some great new shows and spinoffs to keep things fresh.\n\nHere’s a list of the best shows and new seasons released on Prime Video in 2025.\n\nReacher is one of my favorite series on Amazon Prime Video, and the latest installment doesn’t disappoint. After winding up in Maine, Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson) — the former military officer-turned-drifter — gets entangled in a DEA investigation, leading him to go undercover as the bodyguard for the son of Zachary Beck (Anthony Michael Hall), the owner of a rug import company involved in some shady business dealings.\n\nVideo game adaptations keep getting better, but even still, Fallout stands among the best. The first season introduced its trio of postapocalyptic heroes: vault dweller Lucy (Ella Purnell), conflicted Brotherhood of Steel knight Maximus (Aaron Moten), and a ghoul known as... the Ghoul (Walton Goggins). They’re still around in the new second season, but the show also expands its scope quite a bit, with a story that covers more of the world itself, while also diving deep into the past.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to expect when I first switched on Hazbin Hotel, but after watching the first season, I was hooked. The second season is another strong entry into the musical series, with Charlie Morningstar (Erika Henningsen) and her dysfunctional group of friends working to revive the hotel after it was nearly destroyed by an attack from heaven. But things don’t stay peaceful for long, as the three Vs leading Hell’s entertainment industry plot to expand their control over the netherworld.\n\nBosch: Legacy debuted in 2022 as a follow-up to the original Bosch series, and it returned for its third and final season in March. During this final chapter, we see Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver) take on the role of private investigator, all while contending with controversy surrounding the murder of his daughter’s kidnapper, Kurt Dockweiler (David Denman). At the same time, Bosch delves into the disappearance of the Gallagher family as Honey “Money” Chandler launches a campaign to become Los Angeles District Attorney.\n\nIf you’re disappointed that Bosch: Legacy has come to a close, Prime Video debuted a spinoff series in July. The show, called Ballard, stars Maggie Q as Detective Renée Ballard, the head of the LAPD’s new — and underfunded — cold case division. As Ballard and her team dust off old homicide investigations, she dredges up evidence of deep-seated corruption within the police department.\n\nThe third season of Invincible marks a major shift for our titular superhero, Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun), who steps into a new suit and a new role as the Earth’s defender. Throughout the season, Grayson trains even harder as he prepares for battle with the powerful, superhuman warriors from the Viltrum Empire, while continuing to wrestle with and distance himself from the influence of his father, Omni Man (J.K. Simmons).\n\nDaniel Dae Kim stars as David Jung, a former spy who comes out of hiding to find his daughter, Rebecca (Reina Hardesty), who is working as an assassin in South Korea for a now-corrupt intelligence agency called Caddis. With his wife and small child in tow, David aims to pull Rebecca from Caddis’s clutch — but his ties to the organization put a target on the back of him and his family.\n\nWe still have to wait a few more months to see the final season of The Boys, but in the meantime, you might want to check out its spinoff, Gen V, which released its second season in September. Picking up after season 4 of The Boys, the series follows Marie (Jaz Sinclair) and her friends as they navigate a transformed Godolkin University — now a militarized training ground for supes — amid a world where Homelander has more control than ever.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the original Gundam series, Prime Video’s Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX is a must-watch. It draws from the 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam show, taking place in an alternate universe where the militaristic Principality of Zeon is in control.

She has an extensive background writing about the intersection of math, art, and science. So she was a natural choice to speak at the annual conference of Harvard’s interdisciplinary Black Hole Initiative a few years ago. Gamwell focused her talk on the art of black holes, and thus the seeds for what would become Conjuring the Void were sown.\n\n“I was just astounded at how much art there is [about black holes], and I was specifically interested in Asian art,” Gamwell told Ars. “There’s just something about the concept of a black hole that resonates with the Eastern tradition. So many of the themes—the science of black holes, void, nothingness, being inescapable—relate to the philosophy of Buddhism and Taoism and so on.”\n\nGamwell opens the book by chronologically summarizing key developments in the science of black holes, from Isaac Newton and John Mitchell’s 1783 concept of “dark stars,” to the predictions of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and such Nobel Prize-winning discoveries as the LIGO collaboration’s 2016 detection of gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes, and the Event Horizon Telescope’s first image of a black hole in 2019.

Finding a chemical-free way to kill weeds seemed like a solid option.\n\nBut the laser was a dead end. There’s too much risk of starting a fire, he told TechCrunch in an interview. After a lot of trial-and-error prototyping with ideas like cryogenics. The solution he settled on — which he showed off earlier this year at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — is steam.\n\nBoysen’s company has developed a system that uses computer vision to spot weeds in lawns and fields and golf courses, and kill them with nothing but vaporized water. It can be attached to mowers, or tractors, or even ATVs. At the moment, Naware is flexible, and Boysen is visibly eager for his idea to spread fast — much like the weeds he’s trying to kill.\n\nIn a world of agentic AI and billion-dollar software companies, Naware stands out as a classic garage startup story. Boysen said his team first tested the use of steam by ordering a “rinky dink” garment steamer off of Amazon. After that, they ordered seven more.\n\n“They’re not real industrial,” Boysen said he quickly realized. “And so there’s a lot of research helping to develop that, to get to the point of: ‘how do we make this effective and make it repeatable so it can scale?’”\n\nDeveloping the steamer tech was one challenge, but the bigger one may have been identifying the weeds, Boysen said. It’s well-established that artificial intelligence software can be trained to accurately recognize objects or patterns, but the “green-on-green” problem was tough, he said — especially because the software has to recognize the weeds in real-time while the rig is prowling over a lawn.

He said Naware is targeting companies that do lawn care for athletic fields and golf courses, and claims his company can save customers like that “anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000 on chemicals alone.”\n\nOn top of that, he said customers will save money by not having to pay for people whose only job is to spray those chemicals. Naware has been doing paid pilots to test and dial in the product, but Boysen’s pitch has already attracted prospective partners, he said.\n\n“We’re going after the strategic partnerships. We’re in discussions with $5 billion companies that do equipment manufacturing that are interested in our product. And we’re a couple conversations into that — I can’t say their name, but you’ll figure it out,” he laughed.\n\nSuccess, Boysen said, will take three things: those partnerships, securing patents, and funding. Boysen has been bootstrapping Naware for now, but said he’ll open its first fundraising round in the coming months.\n\n“I’ve got to get a funding round that just crushes anybody else trying to think about it” he said. “I’ve got to deliver the promise that I can kill weeds, and it’s effective.

To avoid higher prices on its DIY Edition laptop, Framework notes users can order the device without memory, allowing them to reuse an existing module or find a cheaper option using the link to PCPartPicker that Framework now provides directly on its website.\n\nThis likely won’t be the end of price hikes for Framework, as suppliers indicate that “prices will continue to increase going into early 2026,” according to the post. “We have absorbed and continue to absorb some of the price increases to be able to offer this new pricing, but it is very likely we’ll need to adjust module prices again within the next month,” Framework says. “We’ll only increase prices to cover increases in costs, and we’ll bring prices back down as costs come down in the future.”\n\nThe International Data Corporation expects the global memory shortage to “persist well into 2027” as memory makers like Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix shift their resources toward the lucrative AI industry.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-26T13:13:03-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T18:37:31.778050"}

Last year, some investors thought the IPO market would be back up and running by now (which didn’t quite happen), while others thought the momentum behind AI was poised to accelerate (and they were right). This year, TechCrunch did the same thing, talking to five investors from various markets about what they are preparing for in 2026.\n\nHere is what they said.\n\nWhat will it take for a founder to raise next year, compared to last year?\n\nJames Norman, Managing Partner, Black Ops VC\n\nRaising in 2025 requires a shift from ‘visionary’ to ‘battle-tested.’ In previous years, capital has been a primary moat; now, investors are wary of ‘pilot purgatory,’ when enterprises test AI solutions without an urgent need to buy. In 2026, the bar is rising. Founders must prove to VCs they have more than just traction; they need a distribution advantage. Investors are digging deeper into repeatable sales engines, proprietary workflow/processes and deep subject matter expertise that holds up against the ‘capital arms race’. VCs no longer care about who’s first to market with a flashy demo. They want to know who’s building something that can last, earn trust, and scale long-term.\n\nMorgan Blumberg, Principal, M13\n\nWe believe the funding markets will always be available for the best founders, but the bar will rise. At the earliest stages, especially in AI application software, I do expect fewer mega seed rounds given intense competition and capital already deployed across many categories. Founders will need to stand out with unique distribution channels or perspectives, not just by relying on a large market opportunity and strong backgrounds. Capital moats have already formed around crowded sectors. At the Series-A and B stages, top-quartile rounds will require clear evidence of explosive momentum. The market has now adjusted to these expectations with increased scrutiny on the sustainability of revenue.\n\nAllen Taylor, Managing Partner, Endeavor Catalyst\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

We made 50 investments last year across 25 countries, and we expect to do more this year, so we’re seeing founders at very different stages and in very different markets. The strongest founders aren’t just showing what they’ve built so far — they’re helping investors understand where the business is going next. Real revenue and real customers still matter, but they’re not sufficient on their own. As an investor, I’m always asking: Where is this company today, and where could it realistically be in the next 12, 18, or 24 months? The founders who raise are the ones who can answer that question clearly and credibly.\n\nDorothy Chang, Partner, Flybridge Capital\n\nA lot of founders are finding it easy to build new things because genAI coding tools are so advanced today. But in truth, those tools are leveling the playing field for everyone, and competition is more fierce than ever. So founders building for venture scale need to make sure that they are: 1) truly tackling a big idea, not just something that’s easy to vibe code, 2) building in a problem area that they are uniquely positioned to win, and 3) bringing something proprietary that can’t easily be replicated. This could be a contrarian approach with unique insights, proprietary access to data, deep networks/relationships, a technological advantage, etc. These aren’t new concepts, but the stakes and expectations are higher than ever.\n\nShamillah Bankiya, Partner, Dawn Capital\n\nFor founders selling to enterprises, I think the entire world has gotten smarter on the value that AI can deliver, and as such, proving — showing line of sight to ROI — will be more important than ever to investors. Founders who can prove that their products offer much higher value have the best shot at raising capital.\n\nWhat areas are you looking to invest in and why?\n\nNorman\n\nAs a fund, we remain industry-agnostic generalists, but we are always sharpening our lens. Today we’re looking for ‘high-context founders.’ In a world where AI has commoditized the ability to write code, the winning edge is now lived experience. We want to invest in the founder who has spent years in the trenches of a complex industry and possesses the bespoke expertise that can be 10x’d by AI. For us, the ideal investment is a marriage of deep subject matter expertise and a ‘day zero’ distribution advantage, meaning founders don’t just know what to build but already know exactly who is going to buy it.\n\nBlumberg\n\nWe are particularly interested in sleepy or legacy industries that sit outside core tech founder appetite, where AI can offer step change ROI that drives adoption. These markets have lower competition and moats driven by complexity that often come with less obvious sectors. We also believe 2026 will be a great year for infrastructure supporting foundational model development, as well as frontier research categories like embodied AI and world models. Healthcare remains a major focus given clear signs of buyer demand; we focus on systems of record and platforms rather than point solutions.\n\nTaylor\n\nOutside the United States! The best risk-adjusted venture returns are not in Silicon Valley anymore. They are in markets like Poland, Turkey, and Greece.\n\nWhen you invest across 25 countries in a single year, you stop thinking of venture as something that happens in one place and then spreads outward. Twenty years ago, roughly 90% of venture dollars went to the United States. That flipped in 2018. Today, more than half of venture investment — and more than half of the world’s unicorns — are outside the U.S.\n\nWe see this every day. Founders in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia are building venture-scale companies — often serving massive markets from the start. In our pipeline, it’s normal to see founders from Venezuela building in Iraq, or from Sudan building global businesses.\n\nChang\n\nI’m most interested in founders who are tackling massive problems and leveraging technology for forward progress. I’m rather unmoved by the plethora of startups focused on agentically automating workflows for specific verticals. I’m much more interested in the larger platform shifts that will define this era of technological and societal progress.\n\nBankiya\n\nWe’ve seen tremendous impact on software from AI. I think the next frontier is at the intersection of software and hardware. Most of the world’s GDP is locked up in physical industries, and software-only solutions aren’t enough to fully unlock the world’s growth potential.\n\nDo you think the IPO market will thaw? Why or why not?\n\nNorman\n\nYes, the IPO market is likely to thaw, not because conditions are suddenly ideal, but because the system is running out of viable alternatives. We’re approaching a tipping point where the private market’s ability to sustain multi-billion-dollar valuations, often disconnected from profitability or liquidity, is wearing thin. Years of “paper markups” have postponed reality, but they haven’t eliminated it. Companies, boards, and late-stage investors increasingly need a mechanism to reset expectations, generate real liquidity, and re-establish price discovery.\n\nPrivate credit has acted as a stopgap, extending runways without forcing valuation discipline. But that bridge is starting to look more like a pressure cooker. Debt can delay decisions, not solve structural capital needs, especially for companies built for equity-style growth. At some point, fresh capital becomes necessary, and public markets remain the only place capable of providing it at scale. Their growth narratives and strategic importance can provide the “air cover” needed to reopen the IPO window. Once investors re-engage around category-defining leaders, it creates permission for the broader high-growth software sector to follow.\n\nBlumberg\n\nI think we will see a reopening of the IPO markets driven by the backlog of companies planning to list. Many large tech IPOs are anticipated, including darlings like Anthropic and OpenAI, and I believe one of these mega IPOs will drive considerable momentum for others.\n\nTaylor\n\nYes. 2026 will be a big year for IPOs in New York as dozens of the top companies simply decide “it’s time.” It will also be a banner year for tech IPOs in places folks are not used to seeing them — like the stock market in Saudi Arabia.\n\nI think people underestimate how global the thaw will be. We’ve had nearly four years of muted IPO activity, which has created a backlog of high-quality companies that are ready to be public. When the window opens, it won’t just be U.S. companies stepping through it. There’s already a cohort of major U.S.-listed technology companies from Latin America, including MercadoLibre and Nubank, and there’s another wave right behind them that public-market investors haven’t fully priced in yet. I don’t think all of those companies list in 2026, but several will.\n\nWhat’s even more unexpected is what happens locally. You’re going to see meaningful technology IPOs in places like Saudi Arabia, listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). When companies like Tabby [a buy-now-pay-later outfit] go public locally, it will challenge assumptions about where global tech outcomes happen.\n\nChang\n\nWe’re looking to make slightly fewer, more concentrated bets. There is a ton of startup activity, so when we meet founders who really stand out, we want to be able to back up our high conviction with a higher check size and higher ownership percentage.\n\nBankyia\n\nI think a hard catalyst would be required to reset the IPO markets — something akin to mega AI players facing unprecedented cost increases or sharp revenue declines. Think, for example, of energy prices sharply rising, such that it’s unaffordable to offer compute for AI training and inference.\n\nHow are you looking at the venture market for next year as a fund manager?\n\nNorman\n\nWe’re entering what I’d describe as a clearing event for the venture market, and next year will separate durable platforms from transient ones. The fallout will hit Fund I managers who haven’t found their footing, and active Fund II managers struggling with a [distributions-paid-in-capital, or DPI] drought from 2021 vintages. Traditional institutional anchors, particularly university endowments, are effectively in repair mode. After being squeezed by the absence of liquidity in 2021 and 2022, many are leaning on secondaries, pacing adjustments, and portfolio-smoothing strategies just to maintain existing commitments.\n\nThat means fewer new relationships and far less tolerance for emerging or undifferentiated managers. Stepping into their place are family offices that have moved from passive LP roles to active market forces. They aren’t just filling the ‘LP oxygen’ left by retreating institutions; they are scoping direct mandates and using [registered investment advisors] to hunt for unique, high-conviction strategies.\n\nIn 2026, there is no viable middle ground. You need to have a clinical, defensible track record and/or truly unfair access to differentiated deal flow. Lightly grounded generalist positioning, soft networks, and “good enough” performance won’t survive this cycle.\n\nBlumberg\n\nWe believe we are in the early innings of AI transformation, so we expect next year to be a strong vintage. Capital continues to concentrate in a select number of winners so we focus on being selective and operationally supporting our companies to earn our right to concentrate. We are advising our portfolio companies to strengthen their balance sheets in case of a downturn in 2026 while focusing on building for the long term rather than optimizing for fast funding.\n\nTaylor\n\nAmazing time to back the boldest founders building for the next 10+ years! From a fund manager’s perspective, 2026 looks strong on both deployment and liquidity. Last year we had 12 liquidity events — all through M&A and secondaries. That matters because venture has grown dramatically over the last two decades, while paths to liquidity didn’t keep pace. What’s changing now is that venture is building a more complete liquidity toolkit — M&A, secondaries, and IPOs working together.\n\nThat’s critical when founders are committing 10, 15, even 20 years to building companies. At the same time, we’re seeing real structural shifts in core sectors. Financial technology, especially stablecoins, moved from experimentation to mainstream adoption in 2025, particularly in markets like Latin America and Africa. In those places, this isn’t speculative technology; it’s infrastructure. That combination is why 2026 looks like a strong year to be deploying capital.\n\nBankyia\n\nWe’re still searching for phenomenal European founders building groundbreaking companies. Great companies are formed in all cycles.\n\nWhat will happen to all the investor and startup interest in AI next year?\n\nNorman\n\nIn 2026, the ‘AI curiosity’ that fueled the last two years is being replaced by a demand for application and scale. We are moving from the era of building models to the era of building businesses. The fastest, most innovative companies aren’t the ones with the largest LLMs, they are the ones using AI to solve high-value, domain-specific problems that were previously too complex or too manual to scale. Investors aren’t looking for ‘AI startups’ anymore; we’re looking for exceptional tech founders who have found a way to use this intelligence to 10x the efficiency of a massive, traditional market.\n\nBlumberg\n\nWe expect investor and startup interest to continue at all-time highs. However, I do think we will start to see tuck-in acquisitions, acquihires and wind-downs in highly concentrated sectors such as coding automation, sales automation, marketing and advertising as market share starts to concentrate in select assets.\n\nTaylor\n\nIt will continue. But by the end of 2026, I predict AI will stop being a separate category as it will just be a part of all new technology companies being built.\n\nThere’s a lot of breathless talk about AI right now — and that’s understandable. We’re still very early in understanding what this technology will actually change. In moments like this, excitement tends to run ahead of clarity. Some companies will be transformational, many won’t, and pricing will take time to adjust as real use cases emerge. The opportunity isn’t in labeling everything as “AI.” It’s in understanding where AI meaningfully changes cost structures, speed, or decision-making inside real businesses. That’s where durable value gets created.\n\nThis is one of those moments when the fog is thick, and that’s when outcomes diverge the most.\n\nChang\n\nI don’t see it slowing down anytime soon. We’ve seen a lot of dollars go into infrastructure and theory; this year we’ll see a lot more of that investment more clearly turn into enterprise value at the application level.\n\nBankyia\n\nAI will remain a hot topic, barring negative hard catalysts that dramatically change conditions, like an energy crisis or a rise in default rates.\n\nWhat is something unexpected that could happen in 2026 in the world of venture and startups?\n\nNorman\n\nOne of the most unexpected shifts of 2026 will be the quiet end of the “ChatGPT-first” era in startups. Not because generative AI loses importance, but because no single model remains the default starting point. GPT is no longer consistently best-in-class for search, image generation, or video, which fundamentally changes how tech companies architect their products. The savvy founders in 2026 have already graduated to a multi-model world, and instead their focus has shifted to specialization.\n\nFor example, Anthropic has effectively captured the developer’s mindshare because Claude Code is better at building with you, and Google has finally activated its structural advantages. With Gemini 3, it’s pairing top-tier image and video generation with deep multimodal capability and native access to Google’s search and data ecosystem. That combination is proving hard to compete with. Model choice becomes an infrastructure decision, not a moat. The winners in 2026 won’t be the companies that “use GPT,” but the ones that orchestrate multiple models seamlessly, abstract complexity away from users, and build proprietary workflows on top.\n\nBlumberg\n\nWe expect to see many successful startups built with only one or two rounds of capital. AI tooling (especially coding automation) enables many early-stage companies to accomplish profitability without excessive burn. From a technology perspective, while LLMs are expected to be everywhere, companies will start to scale back usage in favor of more controlled use as enterprises prioritize explainability, cost and reliability. This could drive heavier use of small models, deterministic and probabilistic hybrid models, world models, or simulation modeling.\n\nTaylor\n\nThe end of the Russia-Ukraine war will bring about a renaissance of investing in Ukrainian founders, who are some of the best in the world! Two additional things will genuinely surprise people. First, international companies — especially from Latin America — going public in New York at scale. Second, major technology IPOs coming out of the Middle East, listed locally.

The move puts a sudden stop to five wind farms already under construction, including Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.\n\nThe complaint Dominion filed Tuesday alleges that a stop work order that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued Monday is unlawful, “arbitrary and capricious,” and “infringes upon constitutional principles that limit actions by the Executive Branch.” Dominion wants a federal court to prevent BOEM from enforcing the stop work order.\n\n“Virginia needs every electron we can get as our demand for electricity doubles.”\n\nThe suit also argues that the “sudden and baseless withdrawal of regulatory approvals by government officials” threatens the ability of developers to construct large-scale infrastructure projects needed to meet rising energy demand in the US.\n\n“Virginia needs every electron we can get as our demand for electricity doubles. These electrons will power the data centers that will win the AI race,” Dominion said in a December 22 press release. Virginia is home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, according to the company.\n\nThe rush to build out new data centers for AI — along with growing energy demand from manufacturing and the electrification of homes and vehicles — has put added pressure on already stressed power grids. Rising electricity costs have become a flashpoint in Virginia elections, and in communities near data center projects across the US, as a result. Delaying construction on the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm raises project costs that customers ultimately pay for, Dominion warns.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who is named as one of the defendants in the suit, said that the 90-day pause on offshore wind leases would allow the agency to address national security risks, which were apparently recently identified in classified reports. The US Department of Interior also cited concerns about turbines creating radar interference.\n\n“I want to know what’s changed?” national security expert and former Commander of the USS Cole Kirk Lippold told the Associated Press. “To my knowledge, nothing has changed in the threat environment that would drive us to stop any offshore wind programs.”\n\nThe Trump administration previously halted construction on the Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Empire Wind project off the shore of New York before a federal judge and BOEM lifted stop work orders. Those projects have now been suspended again. President Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum upon stepping into office in January withdrawing areas on the outer continental shelf from offshore wind leasing, which a federal judge struck down earlier this month for being “arbitrary and capricious.”\n\nRelated The future of wind energy might come down to one turbine blade\n\nDominion Energy says it had already obtained all the federal, state, and local approvals necessary for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm, which broke ground in 2024. The company has already spent $8.9 billion to date on the $11.2 billion project that was expected to start generating power next year. Fully up and running, the offshore wind farm is supposed to have the capacity to produce 9.5 million megawatt-hours per year of carbon pollution-free electricity, about as much as 660,000 homes might use in the US.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-26T17:14:47-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T22:25:37.022238"}

Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been placed into judicial liquidation — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency.\n\nThe company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr’s FootPrint Coalition, taxpayers, and many others.\n\nUltimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to “revolutionize the food chain” with insect-based protein. But don’t be too quick to attribute its failure to the ‘ick’ factor that many Westerners feel about bugs. Human food was never its core focus.\n\nInstead, Ÿnsect focused on producing insect protein for animal feed and pet food, two markets with very different economics and margins that the company never quite chose between.\n\nThat indecision extended to its M&A strategy. In 2021, Ÿnsect acquired Protifarm, a Dutch company raising mealworms for human food applications, adding a third market to the mix. Even as the company announced the deal, then-CEO Antoine Hubert admitted it would take a couple of years for human food to represent just 10% to 15% of Ÿnsect’s revenue.\n\n“We still see pet food and fish feed being the largest contributor to our revenues in the coming years,” Hubert declared at the time. In other words, Ÿnsect was acquiring a company in a market segment that would remain marginal for years — at a time when the startup desperately needed revenue growth.\n\nAnd revenue was the problem. According to publicly available data, Ÿnsect’s revenue from its main entity peaked at €17.8 million in 2021 (approximately $21 million) — a figure reportedly inflated by inflated by internal transfers between subsidiaries. By 2023, the company had racked up a net loss of €79.7 million ($94 million).\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The answer wasn’t hype-driven crossover funds paying inflated multiples during the 2021 funding frenzy. Instead, Ÿnsect attracted impact-focused investors like Astanor Ventures and public investment bank Bpifrance that bought into a compelling sustainability vision.\n\nIts pitch to them was simple — offering an alternative to resource-intensive proteins like fishmeal and soy. That same thesis also attracted significant capital to competitors like Better Origin and Innovafeed, and it seemed promising.\n\nBut the vision collided with market reality. Animal feed is a commodity market driven by price, not sustainability premiums. In a perfect world, insect protein would be fully circular, with insects fed on food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. But in practice, factory-scale insect production typically ends up relying on cereal byproducts that are already usable as animal feed — meaning insect protein just adds an expensive extra step. For animal feed, the math simply wasn’t working.\n\nŸnsect eventually recognized this. Pet food proved to be a different equation: it is less price-driven than animal feed and a far better market for insect protein, even with competition from other alternative proteins such as lab-grown meat. By 2023, the company refocused its strategy on pet food and other higher-margin segments, with Hubert citing broader economic pressures.\n\n“In an environment where there is inflation on energy and raw materials but also on the cost of capital and debt, we cannot afford to invest loads of resources in markets which are the least remunerative (animal feed), while you have other markets where there is a lot of demand, good returns and higher margins,” Hubert said at the time.\n\nThe 2023 pivot to pet food came too late. By then, Ÿnsect had already committed to a massive, capital-intensive bet that would ultimately doom the company. That bet was Ÿnfarm, a “giga-factory” in Northern France that the company billed “the world’s most expensive bug farm.” Built for insect production at scale, the facility consumed hundreds of millions in funding — money spent before Ÿnsect had proven its business model or figured out its unit economics.\n\nTo oversee Ÿnfarm’s launch, Ÿnsect brought in Shankar Krishnamoorthy, a former executive at French energy giant Engie. When that move to pet food failed to save the company, Krishnamoorthy replaced Hubert as CEO.\n\nŸnsect then shut down the production plant it had acquired from Protifarm and cut jobs. But shuttering one facility while operating a giga-factory built for the wrong market couldn’t solve the fundamental problem.\n\nFor Professor Joe Haslam, who teaches a course on Scaling Up in the MBA Program at IE Business School, “Ÿnsect’s struggles are not a mystery and not mainly about insects. They are the result of a mismatch between industrial ambition, capital markets, and timing, compounded by some execution and strategy choices.”\n\nThe fact that Ÿnsect failed doesn’t mean the entire insect farming sector is doomed. Competitor Innovafeed is reportedly holding up better, in part because it started with a smaller production site and is ramping up incrementally.\n\nFor Prof. Haslam, Ÿnsect exemplifies a broader European problem. “Ÿnsect is a case study in Europe’s scaling gap. We fund moonshots. We underfund factories. We celebrate pilots. We abandon industrialization. See Northvolt [a struggling Swedish battery maker], Volocopter [a German air taxi startup, and Lilium [a failed Germany flying taxi company],” he said.\n\nThe failure has prompted some soul-searching. Hubert himself co-founded Start Industrie, an association advocating for policies to support French industrial startups — a recognition that Europe needs more than just funding to build the next generation of deep-tech companies.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:52:08 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T22:57:57.470897"}

Meal kits like HelloFresh have always been a better deal than they get credit for, even at full price: It’s actually hard to recreate meal kit meals for less than you can get the recipes delivered to your home. But it’s especially worth it when you can find a HelloFresh coupon, promo code, or discount at more than half off.\n\nI’ll admit I wasn’t that sold on HelloFresh when I first tried it most of a decade ago. It was useful, it got me out of my staid routines, but I wasn’t impressed with the selection. It felt a little basic. But lately? Honestly, it’s kinda cosmopolitan these days, after expanding to a dozen countries and absorbing the supply networks from multiple other meal plans. When I last tested the HelloFresh meal kit (7/10, WIRED Recommends), I was surprised to find myself cooking credible home renditions of ramen, ponzu-plum beef stir fry, and Southwest-accented pork roasts. And when I’m able to pick up a HelloFresh discount code, it’s generally less than I’d spend on groceries anyway. So it’s a good moment to try out a lifestyle where the food comes in the mail.\n\nGet 50% Off and up to 10 Free Meals as a New HelloFresh Customer\n\nRight now, new and returning customers can take advantage of a HelloFresh discount code offering 50% off your first meal kit box plus a free item each week.

But there’s a hack to getting discounts anyway. After you pause or cancel your subscription, check your inbox after the next few days or weeks. Often, you’ll get HelloFresh coupon codes for discounts.\n\nTypical HelloFresh “come-back” offers after a canceled subscription include: $100 to $180 off (spread out over several meal boxes), free shipping on the first box (after re-subscribing), free items such as dessert, breakfast, or an extra protein per meal, or a free meal box is offered after a break. Typical retention offers, for when customers try to cancel, include: 40% off the next box, if you decide not to cancel, or 25% off the next two meal kits. None of this is failsafe, of course, offers vary for each customer. But as with magazine subscriptions, sometimes canceling, or trying to cancel, will lead to a good discount offer from a company eager to keep your business.\n\nWhen to Save the Most on HelloFresh Subscriptions\n\nHelloFresh almost always has some sort of deal going, whether to bring in new customers with an especially choice HelloFresh coupon, or bring back previous customers with HelloFresh discount codes and retention offers. But summer tends to be one of the times they offer the steepest discounts, including 10 free meals across several boxes, complimentary appetizers, free ready-made items, or free shipping on select boxes.\n\nThe other big times for HelloFresh coupon codes are around Black Friday and the end of the year.

Instead, the next act of terror will begin with the buzzing sound of the drone rotors spinning at 5,000 rpm, audible only seconds before the swarm will reach its target.\n\nIn recent years, drones have become an integral part of modern warfare. On the battlefield, we've undeniably entered the age of precise mass in conflict, where low-cost attributable drones, powered by widely available commercial technology, open software, and AI, are now the most effective weapons. They can be hidden in plain sight and then launched to destroy targets thousands of miles away from active battlefields. In June 2025, for instance, they were used by Ukraine to destroy 10 percent of Russia's bombers on the tarmac as part of Operation Spider Web. That same month, Israel also launched clandestine drone attacks from within Iran to destroy military and nuclear sites. In April, Houthi rebels used drones and cruise missiles to attack the USS Harry Truman—a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier—in the Red Sea. The carrier swerved so hard to avoid being struck, it tumbled a $56 million F-18 off its deck.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.\n\nIt is certain that in 2026 we will see a drone attack in the United States, against either civilian or military targets.\n\nLike the attacks of 9/11, the surprise will turn out not to be a surprise. The offensive and defensive power of low-cost commercial drones was known by the US military as early as 2017. In that year, Defense Innovation Unit, the Pentagon’s Silicon Valley Office, established the military’s first commercial drone unit, with the support of the then–secretary of defense James Mattis. Named Rogue Squadron, it conducted mock drone fights in parking lots and created the first mass adoption program within the military for commercial drones, called Blue UAS (unmanned aerial system).\n\nYet today, because of bureaucratic inertia and the accelerating drone capability by foreign adversaries, the US stands defenseless. Currently, no US military installation can reliably repel a complex drone attack like Ukraine’s assault of Russian nuclear bombers. Our civilian infrastructure is even less protected.\n\nYet the 2025 DoD budget has just $350M for tactical level UAS systems. With this funding, DoD is only expecting to field about 4,000 UASs, bringing the average cost per system close to $100,000. The larger drone factories in Ukraine can produce thousands of “first person viewer” (FPV) drones per day, at a cost of a few hundred dollars a piece. The Ukrainian military delivers to the battlefield 200,000 FPV drones per month and plans to expand production to 4,500,000 FPV drones per year by the end this year.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T10:26:36.752899"}

DeepSeek shook the world by releasing a cutting-edge large language model with much less compute than US rivals, but OpenRouter, a platform that routes queries to different AI models, says Qwen has rapidly risen in popularity through the year to become the second-most-popular open model in the world.\n\nQwen can do most things you’d want from an advanced AI model. For Rokid’s users, this might include identifying products snapped by a built-in camera, getting directions from a map, drafting messages, searching the web, and so on. Since Qwen can easily be downloaded and modified, Rokid hosts a version of the model, fine-tuned to suit its purposes. It is also possible to run a teensy version of Qwen on smartphones or other devices just in case the internet connection goes down.\n\nBefore going to China I installed a small version of Qwen on my MacBook Air and used it to practice some basic Mandarin.

The previous year, millions of new memecoins had flooded the market; a few, like Fartcoin, had rocketed to billion-dollar valuations. Pump.Fun, a platform for launching and trading memecoins, had become one of the fastest-growing crypto launchpad businesses ever. Now, the soon-to-be president was getting in on the act.\n\nOver lunch on the second day of the conference, beneath the ornate stucco ceiling and golden chandeliers of the venue’s dining hall, I located a table designated for a conversation about memecoins. Whereas other tables were half full, the memecoin workshop was oversubscribed; latecomers pulled up chairs to create two full rows.\n\nThe discussion was led by Nagendra Bharatula, founder of investment firm G-20 Group. Bharatula had recently coauthored a paper arguing that memecoins, despite their juvenile spirit, had a place in professional investors’ portfolios. In the six months prior, a basket of 25 “bluechip memecoins”—an oxymoron if ever there was one—had outperformed bitcoin by 150 percent, he pointed out.

This hybrid is up for it.", "content": "I've received all sorts of questions about mattresses over the years, ranging from what might help with back pain to suitable options for children. There's one small use case that I've always had particular interest in, however: the best mattresses for putting in your guest room, vacation rental, or any space where visitors stay in the short term.\n\nFinding a mattress that will work for all sleeping positions and body types is a pretty tall order. When you're traveling, you usually want a soft, supportive place to land for a bit. The Tuft & Needle Original Hybrid is one such mattress that pulls this off—just in time for those last-minute holiday guests you just found out will be staying with you.\n\nStitched Up\n\nChances are, you’ve heard of Tuft & Needle. The brand was one of the first to break into the DTC (direct-to-consumer) mattress-in-a-box scene when it was founded in 2012. T&N's profile continued to skyrocket, with a pretty successful track record. I’ve tested many iterations of the brand's mattresses over the years, and they've maintained consistent material quality and performance.\n\nFirst, there's a soft cover—not cool to the touch, but smooth. Next come three proprietary foams, starting with the T&N “Flex” foam, which is designed to adapt to your body and firm up as you settle in. Next is a “Release” foam, which provides cushioning to relieve pressure. Last is the “Adaptive\" foam, designed for firmer support to not only keep the body lifted, but help sleepers move around with ease. Pocketed coils remain in the center for full-body support, better air circulation within the mattress, and better pressure relief than you’d get with a standard, traditional coil.\n\nThere are two certifications to boot: CertiPur-US certified foam and GreenGuard Gold, which essentially verify that the bed's materials produce no harmful air emissions. Compared to the other mattress types I test and interact with, the Tuft & Needle is actually a pretty simple construction. But just because it's not the flashiest doesn't mean it's not a solid mattress option.\n\nShipping Free in the contiguous US Sleep Trial 100 nights Warranty 10-year limited Certfications CertiPur-US certified memory foam, GreenGuard Gold\n\nSoft, Softer\n\nUnboxing was easy peasy. The mattress box was a bit heavier because the bed contains coils, but I was able to maneuver it solo. Tuft & Needle recommends leaving the mattress alone for one to two hours to let the foam layers fully expand. I always recommend you give it one to two days instead. This is standard good practice for any mattress and gives it the literal breathing room it needs to reach its full support potential. Side note: I noticed much more off-gassing on the following day (typical), but it smelled like cucumber-melon scented body lotion or candles, which is not normal. It wasn't a bad thing per se, but it was definitely a first for me.\n\nAt its full height, the mattress is 12 inches tall, but it felt like more. My husband popped into my workspace during the first day of testing and announced, “Have you felt this bed? It feels like an actual marshmallow.” Afterward, I found him taking impromptu naps on it throughout the testing period. This squishy feel can be attributed to the initial layer of T&N’s aforementioned “Flex” foam. Night one of sleeping, I instantly sank into the bed. Sometimes, with memory foam mattresses (Tempur-Pedic comes to mind), they can feel firm at first as your body heat is absorbed. From there, the foam molds to your body, creating a soft and supportive feel. Not the case with the Tuft & Needle Original Hybrid, as you get softness from the jump. This softer feel also helped isolate motion, so if I got in and out of bed or my dogs decided to jump in with me, there wasn't any overt rocking.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:32:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T11:40:46.149955"}

It previously released the 20th Anniversary Duke Controller—a remake of the original Xbox's infamously unwieldy pad that no one really liked—so this take on Microsoft's archrival's pad sits right alongside that. It's a controller that comes packaged with a knowing wink.\n\nWhile the likes of Thrustmaster's H.E.A.R.T. controller also opt for a black-and-white look that subtly evokes the PS5's palette, the Hyperkin is more … let's say \"directly inspired,\" at least for the two-tone model (it's also available in solid black). The white of the outer hand grips meet in the center, with a black base. That black contrast edges in at the top, subtly creating a fitting \"X\" design.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 12:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T12:51:19.809181"}

They listened to descriptions of the hazardous chemicals the plants will use, their huge water withdrawals and energy demands.\n\nWhen it came time for questions, people began shifting in their chairs and standing up, making the cramped room feel even smaller.\n\nWhat if the chemicals leak, one woman asked. What’s in it for the politicians in their “velvet chairs,” another demanded. A third warned it would be just like the Soviet era, when iron and steel plants left a polluted legacy.\n\nThen a woman began to tear up as she told the 50 or so people who had gathered in a community center on a cold, dark evening that the factories’ smokestacks and hazardous materials were about a mile from her daughter’s kindergarten.\n\n“Please stand up for yourselves,” she said, urging the audience to spread the word.\n\nThe Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, is nearing completion on what could be one of Europe’s largest electric vehicle battery factories. The industrial park where it is located, outside Debrecen, Hungary’s second-largest city, also hosts several other manufacturers of battery parts and supplies. At least two of those are owned by Chinese companies, one by a South Korean firm. Another Chinese-owned battery factory is being built on the other side of the city.\n\nThe surge of construction is part of a nationwide frenzy, prompted by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s goal to make Hungary a leading battery manufacturer. To reach this target, Orbán has looked primarily to Beijing. Chinese companies have announced or built at least 18 EV and battery-related projects in Hungary so far, $17 billion in pledged investments, according to data compiled by the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWhile the factories could position Hungary in the center of Europe’s transition off fossil fuels, they have prompted a backlash from residents worried about their impacts on public health and the environment.\n\n“Everyone will get their fair share of this stew,” said Éva Kozma, who leads the Mikepércs Mothers for the Environment Association, a citizen activist group that hosted the event.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nCity of Shadows\n\nThis Spanish crime thriller plays with a lot of genre conventions—a disgraced cop, Milo Malart (Isak Férriz), forced to prove himself again; the frosty relationship with a new female partner, Rebeca Garrido (Verónica Echegui), brought in from another department; a maze of clues and conspiracy elements—but gets a distinct twist thanks to its Barcelona setting. When a series of ritualistic murders spreads across the city, seemingly tied to the architecture of Antoni Gaudí, the city itself becomes a character in a sprawling and increasingly bizarre case. The English-dubbed version leaves a lot to be desired, but the original Spanish audio and English subtitles are available, and make for the perfect way to enjoy this twisty, pulpy limited series.\n\nTomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft\n\nBridging the gap between the modern Tomb Raider prequel games and the events of the original 1990s outings, The Legend of Lara Croft finds the iconic treasure hunter (voiced by Hayley Atwell) still growing into her role as a globe-trotting adventurer. Grappling with her own traumatic past while forging bonds with vital allies, this animated outing finds Lara searching for ancient artifacts with a personal connection to her own family, and hunting down powerful masks that channel world-changing powers. Throw in a few encounters with meddling spirits and angry gods, and Lara’s in for some of the toughest battles of her life—and this is a woman who’s canonically fought T-rexes armed only with a pair of pistols. A must-watch for fans of the games, and an action-packed thrill ride even for those who’ve never picked up a controller in their life.\n\nStranger Things\n\nAfter what feels like a thousand years trapped in the Upside Down (although in reality only three and a half), Stranger Things is back for its fifth and final season. Following the reality-tearing events of Stranger Things 4, the residents of Hawkins are now under military quarantine, but not everyone is taking it laying down. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) is secretly training her powers, aided by adoptive parents Hopper (David Harbour) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), while Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), and the rest of the adventuring party are organizing an underground movement to hunt down demonic big-bad Vecna. But when Mike's young sister Holly (Nell Fisher) is dragged into the Upside Down by a Demogorgon, it raises one major question—just why was Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) kidnapped at the very start of the show, instigating the wave of horror that's consumed Hawkins since? The full eight-episode season is being released in three blocks—the first four are out now, three more arrive on December 25, and the overall finale lands on New Year's Eve—but the ultimate end of Stranger Things is off to a strong start.\n\nThe Beast in Me\n\nAuthor Aggie Wiggs (Clare Danes) is struggling on her next book—but when property magnate Nile Jarvis (Matthew Rhys) moves into the neighborhood, still dogged by lingering accusations that he murdered his first wife, the perfect subject may be right next door. Although she initially rejects his suggestion to write about him, Aggie is drawn ever deeper into the darkly charismatic Nile's world in the wake of another suspicious death, one with a deeply personal connection to her own tragic past. While The Beast in Me boasts phenomenal performances from its wider cast—including Natalie Morales as Aggie's ex-wife Shelley and Brittany Snow as Nile's new wife Nina, who may have her own secrets—it's the increasingly tense and deeply psychologically twisted connection that forms between Danes' and Rhys' characters that makes it impossible to look away from this eight-episode thriller.\n\nLast Samurai Standing\n\nSet in late 1800s Japan, Last Samurai Standing follows retired samurai Shujiro Saga (Junichi Okada), who enters the savage \"Kodoku\" tournament in a desperate effort to save his family, struck down by cholera. The problem is, he's one of 292 former samurai aiming to win the ¥100,000 prize, and the only way to progress through the competition is to collect tags from fallen enemies and pass through checkpoints set up by the event's mysterious organizers. It's going to be a bloodbath. Based on the series of Japanese novels written by Shogo Imamura and illustrated by Katsumi Tatsuzawa, this packs in some of the finest sword duels and martial arts sequences ever committed to the screen, all while exploring the rapidly changing face of Japanese society after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Think Squid Game set in Meiji era Japan, and you're scratching the surface of this thrilling six-episode miniseries.\n\nSplinter Cell: Deathwatch\n\nNetflix's roster of adult animation adds another hit with this spin-off of Ubisoft's spy action series. Set years after the events of the games, Deathwatch finds grizzled veteran Sam Fisher (Liev Schreiber) dragged out of retirement to rescue a younger agent, Zinnia McKenna (Kirby Howell-Baptiste, known mononymously as Kirby), after one of her own missions goes grievously wrong. It's a dark and gritty affair, both tonally and visually—the animation is handled by a cohort of Danish and French studios, giving it more a bande dessinée look rather than aping anime—boasting top-notch action throughout. What else would you expect though, given the show was developed for screen by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad? Already renewed for a second season, this brutal epic is only getting started.\n\nThe Witcher\n\nAlmost everything is different in The Witcher’s fourth season. Gone is former leading man Henry Cavill, with Liam Hemsworth donning the gray wig as monster-slaying Geralt of Rivia in his place. It's been a controversial switch, but Hemsworth holds his own well enough, despite being perhaps a bit too cautious in his portrayal. However, this latest chapter in the fantasy epic, based on the novels of Andrzej Sapkowski, really belongs to sorceress Yennefer (the returning Anya Chalotra), gathering forces against the dark mage Vilgefortz (Mahesh Jadu), and trainee Witcher Ciri (Freya Allen), seeking a new life for herself with a group of thieves called the Rats. While the core trio's tales barely intersect this season, the distance allows each to stand on their own strengths. It also sets the stage for greater things to come in the fifth and final season. This Cavill-less Witcher might take some getting used to, but if you've been watching since the beginning, it's definitely worth sticking around.\n\nBoots\n\nAdapted from Greg Cope White’s memoir The Pink Marine, this eight-episode series follows closeted teen Cameron Cope (Miles Heizer) as he follows his friend Ray (Liam Oh) into the US Marine Corps—even as his mother Barbara (Vera Farmiga) barely notices him leaving. Picking up in 1990—before “Don't Ask, Don't Tell”—Boots walks the fine line between drama and comedy as it charts Cameron's fish-out-of-water travails through basic training. While it could all have easily devolved into a collection of tropes, the series instead serves up a smart exploration of masculinity and camaraderie that can feel surprisingly tender at times, while never pulling its punches when it comes to the conditions recruits can face.\n\nWayward\n\nWayward was created by comedian Mae Martin, but don’t expect a laugh riot in this dark and distressing thriller. The series focuses on the secretive Tall Pines Academy in Vermont, a boarding school for troubled teens, ruled with an iron fist by self-styled savior Evelyn Wade (a chillingly commanding Toni Collette). Except, to the outside world, Wade is a caring pillar of the community, helping desperate youths—a dichotomy that the school’s latest residents, Abbie (Sydney Topliffe) and Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind), are about to brutally experience firsthand. Their only hope may be Alex (Martin), a newly transferred cop who grows suspicious of the hold Wade has over both the town and Laura (Sarah Gadon), Alex’s wife who is herself a graduate of Tall Pines. Despite having the vibe of a docudrama, Wayward is entirely fictional—but its exploration of control, coercion, and the power of charismatic figures feels all too real.\n\nHouse of Guinness\n\nIf you’re a fan of a pint of the black stuff—that’s famed Irish stout beer Guinness for the nondrinkers out there—this historical drama based on the family behind its creation will go down smooth. When patriarch Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness dies, he leaves behind one of the largest and most powerful businesses in Ireland, setting the stage for a war of succession between his four children. With control left to eldest sons Arthur (Anthony Boyle) and Edward (Louis Partridge), but nothing for daughter Anne (Emily Fairn), and only a token trust fund for Benjamin Jr. (Fionn O’Shea), the wealthiest family in Ireland is about to go to war—right as the company is trying to expand into New York. Is it 100 percent authentic to the period or settings? About as accurate as creator Steven Knight’s Peaky Blinders was to early 20th century Birmingham, England—which is to say, not exactly, but the mix of drama, betrayal, and politics is a hell of a lot of fun all the same. Sláinte!\n\nHaunted Hotel\n\nWhen Katherine inherited the dilapidated Undervale Hotel from her late brother Nathan, she didn't expect he'd still be ra esident there—but anyone who dies at the Undervale never checks out, so he's hanging around as a ghost. Now Katherine is stuck trying to manage a failing business, keep a few centuries’ worth of squabbling specters happy, and stop her kids Ben and Esther from dabbling in the dark arts—all while Abaddon, a demon trapped in a pilgrim child's body, keeps trying to get his infernal powers back. Created by Rick and Morty writer Matt Roller, Haunted Hotel starts off as a seemingly familiar addition to Netflix's roster of original adult animated series but manages to interrupt its spooky hijinks with some unexpectedly profound and emotionally resonant moments. With a voice cast boasting comedy greats Will Forte and Eliza Coupe, Haunted Hotel is worth digging up this Halloween.\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) was mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills turned out to be an edge in navigating a series of lethal games that tested intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after finally escaping and starting a new life with Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), the newly arrived third and final season finds Arisu drawn back into the Borderland for one final round of brutal games—with the lives of everyone he cares about on the line. Going beyond the material laid down in Haro Aso's original manga was a risky decision, but it pays off in this last batch of six episodes, serving up some of the most inventive and thrilling challenges in the series' history while tying up some long-running character arcs.\n\nBlack Rabbit\n\nThe Black Rabbit is on its way to being New York’s hottest restaurant, an ultra-cool eatery that’s one glowing New York Times review away from blowing up. Proprietor Jake Friedken (Jude Law) has poured everything into it—so it’s the absolute worst time for his screw-up brother Vince (Jason Bateman) to crawl back into his life. On the run from a hit-and-run in Reno, and with long-standing debts to the mob hanging over him, Vince’s reappearance threatens to drag Jake down, and pushes brotherly love to lethal limits. Created by writers Zach Baylin and Kate Susman, this eight-episode limited series blends The Bear and Breaking Bad into a deliciously tense thriller that leaves you wanting a second course.\n\nWolf King\n\nBased on the Wereworld books by Curtis Jobling, this animated fantasy adventure follows young farmer Drew (Cel Spellman), whose life is thrown into chaos when he learns he’s actually the hidden son of the lost Wolf King. Being the Wolf King's hidden son means he's also the last threat to the rule of King Leopold, the werelion who has stolen the throne. Joined by reluctant allies Whitley (Nina Barker Francis) and Hector (Chris Lew Kum Hoi), Drew is thrust into a quest to master his lupine powers and claim the crown he’s destined for—if they can evade Leopold’s forces. While the animation style won’t be for everyone—a pseudo-stop-motion approach—Wolf King will capture fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Dragon Prince, and its balance of swords and sorcery and savage werebeasts gives it just enough bite for parents and older viewers.\n\nLong Story Short\n\nAdult animation is awash with family sitcoms—The Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob’s Burgers, on and on—but they’re all stuck in the perma-present, mixing outlandish events with a never-changing status quo. Not so for Long Story Short, the latest series from BoJack Horseman creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg. The show follows the thoroughly pedestrian antics of the Schwoopers, jumping between the 1950s and 2020s as it does so. As it ricochets through the lives of parents Naomi and Elliot, and their children Avi, Shira, and Yoshi, it proves itself as a series that balances finding comedy in the mundane—from chaotic bar mitzvahs to anniversaries-turned-interventions—with Waksberg’s penchant for the poignant woven throughout, all brought to life by a fantastic voice cast including Ben Feldman, Abbi Jacobson, and Nicole Byer. Already renewed for a second season, this is one story Netflix hasn’t cut short.\n\nHostage\n\nWith the UK in the midst of a health crisis, prime minister Abigail Dalton (Suranne Jones) is keen to strike a deal for medicine from French president Vivienne Toussaint (Julie Delpy)—standard politics, until Dalton’s husband Alex (Ashley Thomas), a doctor working with Medicins san Frontieres, is kidnapped in French Guiana. With the kidnappers demanding the PM’s resignation, the professional and the personal dangerously blur, while a conspiracy threatens Toussaint’s own position. Tense and masterfully paced, and with striking performances from Jones and Delpy, this five-episode limited series is an excellent political thriller to binge.\n\nWednesday\n\nAfter spending the summer honing her psychic powers by tracking down serial killers, Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) returns to Nevermore Academy—but this school year is more of an Addams Family reunion. With her mother, Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), drawn into an onsite committee role by suspicious new principal Barry Dort (Steve Buscemi), brother Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez) joining the school after developing electric powers, and eccentric Grandmama (Joanna Lumley) turning up, Wednesday barely has a chance to investigate a new string of murders or a conspiracy surrounding a shady psychiatric hospital. The perils of the show’s protracted three-year gap between seasons is hard to overlook in places—Pugsley now towers over Wednesday, explained as a growth spurt, and you’ll almost certainly need to rewatch the first season to remember what’s going on—but this is a welcome return for Netflix’s spooky, ooky teen drama.\n\nLove, Death + Robots\n\nDeveloped by Deadpool director Tim Miller, Love, Death + Robots is one of Netflix’s most exciting animated offerings—an anthology series where the only common thread is each episode’s unique interpretation of that eponymous trio of themes. Now in its fourth season, viewers are treated to wild concepts that include psychic street gangs in a postapocalyptic future (400 Boys), a re-creation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Live at Slane Castle performance of “Can’t Stop” in marionette form (directed by David Fincher, no less), and, in a rare hybrid of live action and CGI, a priest (played by Rhys Darby) meeting an alien envoy that thinks God has been reborn as an Earth dolphin. Wildly experimental, Love, Death + Robots constantly juggles animation styles and genres and practically vibrates off the screen with sheer visual energy. You never know what you’re going to get with this show—and that’s half the fun.\n\nSneaky Pete\n\nJust released from prison, Marius (Giovanni Ribisi) steals the identity of former cellmate Pete Murphy in order to hide from the dangers of his old life. On the run from a vicious gangster played by Bryan Cranston (who also jointly created the show), Marius nestles in with Pete’s motley crew of estranged family. They're delighted to be reunited with their long-lost relative, but he finds taking over another man’s life might be even more dangerous than the past he’s running from. Originally an Amazon Prime series, this three-season drama can now be binged in its entirety on Netflix.\n\nGrace and Frankie\n\nThe brainchild of Friends cocreator Marta Kauffman, this sharp sitcom sees Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as the titular Grace and Frankie, longtime acquaintances forced into living together after their husbands leave them late in life—for each other. The show follows this contemporary odd couple as they deal with their ex-husbands' coming out, their adult children's drama, and each other's maddening personalities, all while building a genuine friendship and trying to prove to themselves and the world that age is just a number. Taking cues from Arrested Development, Grace and Frankie's chief comedic currency is awkwardness, as their two extended families—the rich, business-minded Hansons and the borderline hippy Bergsteins—bring their neuroses and baggage to bear while navigating adult familial relationships. Think of it as a modern-day Golden Girls—just with more swearing and drug use.\n\nSakamoto Days\n\nTaro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hitman par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn't exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto's lost none of his skills—even though he's let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi's strict \"no killing\" rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy action anime is a blast. Now into its second season, with new episodes dropping each Monday, it's appointment viewing you won't want to miss.\n\nSquid Game\n\nThe Korean sensation that became a global phenomenon, Squid Game’s blend of Hunger Games’ shocking elimination battles and Parasite’s condemnation of exploitative capitalism turned it into one of Netflix's biggest-ever hits. It started off simply enough—hundreds of desperate people recruited to compete in a series of playground games with a deadly twist, the survivor winning a ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot. But now, with its third and final season, the stakes are higher than ever, and even perennial survivor Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) might not be able to win this round. Intense, brutal, and frequently graphic, Squid Game remains gripping to the very end.\n\nTrainwreck\n\nLittle else is as fascinating as a real-life disaster born of sheer hubris. The strange mix of “saw that one coming” and “get the popcorn,” as you watch events unfold makes for captivating viewing. That's the special sauce for Trainwreck, Netflix's series of documentaries exploring some of the biggest, well, train wrecks of recent history. From the crack-cocaine-fueled tenure of Toronto's disgraced mayor Rob Ford to the avoidable errors that saw a luxury cruise liner turned into an infamous “poop cruise,” each installment is a fascinating exploration of how badly things can go wrong when the wrong people are in charge. Netflix oddly categorizes each Trainwreck as its own movie, but it's really a loosely connected anthology, and while some cases require their own multi-episode arcs to excavate the wreckage (shoutout to Woodstock ’99), there's no particular starting point—simply pick your favorite screw-up and just try to look away.\n\nThe Survivors\n\nYears ago, Kieran Elliott (Charlie Vickers) survived a storm that trapped him in a sea cave, but his brother Finn and friend Toby died in the rescue attempt. Fifteen years later, he returns to his hometown with his partner Mia (Yerin Ha) and their baby Audrey for a memorial, finding that everyone from neighbors to his own mother still blame him for the tragedy. While those deaths still haunt the small town community, they may also have obscured another tragedy—teenager Gabby Birch went missing the same night. Now, out-of-town investigator Bronte (Shannon Berry), the only person who still cared about the long-cold case, has wound up dead herself, and everyone in Kieran's life seems to be connected. Adapted from the novel by Jane Harper, this Australian murder mystery from Glitch creator Tony Ayres is a darkly compelling miniseries.\n\nDept. Q\n\nEdinburgh police detective Carl Morck (The Crown's Matthew Goode) used to be one of the best—until his arrogance got his partner paralyzed and a uniformed officer killed, and saw him narrowly survive a bullet through his own neck. After returning to work following a lengthy period of mandatory leave, Morck finds himself heading up the new Department Q—an underfunded, under-staffed operation in the precinct's dank basement, dedicated to solving the iciest of cold cases. Gathering a team of misfits, including Rose (Leah Byrne), eager to please but recovering from a breakdown, Akram (Alexej Manvelov), a Syrian refugee, and Morck's still-bedbound partner James (Jamie Sives), the department has a lot to prove—but solving the disappearance of Merritt Linguard (Chloe Pirrie) might be a good start. Based on the novels by Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen, Dept. Q is a brilliant blend of Scandi noir and gritty British crime drama.\n\nSirens\n\nFirst The White Lotus, then The Perfect Couple, and now Sirens—Meghann Fahy is making a career out of starring in shows where we get to see awfully rich people doing awfully bad things to each other. Here, she plays down-on-her-luck Devon, drawn into the luxurious world her sister Simone (Milly Alcock, imminently Supergirl) inhabits by proxy, working as an assistant to billionaire's wife Michaela (Julianne Moore). It's never clear how willingly Simone got involved with the charismatic Michaela, who may be a mentor or cult leader or something else entirely, nor how overprotective or paranoid Devon is, but the hook of this glossy, dark comedy is in finding out.\n\nBlood of Zeus\n\nThis adult animated take on Greek mythology returns for its third and final season, bringing the odyssey of demigod Heron—son of Zeus and mortal woman Electra—to a brutal conclusion. After years of manipulation, power plays, and betrayals, the season picks up with the Olympian gods and their Titan predecessors lined up against each other, the fate of the world hanging on the outcome of the ultimate family feud. Heron and his estranged brother Seraphim may be the only ones able to bring peace—so it's rather inconvenient that Heron is dead. From start to finish, Blood of Zeus has impressed with smart writing that offers compelling twists on the classic myths, all brought to life with top-tier animation and phenomenal voice acting, and it doesn't disappoint as it reaches its finale. One of Netflix's best animated series.\n\nYou\n\nBased on the novels of Caroline Kepnes, You is an often deeply disturbing series. During the first season, bookstore manager Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) falls in deranged-love-at-first-sight with aspiring author Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail). In subsequent ones, he relocates to Los Angeles, where heiress Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) became the focus of his attention, and then to London, where he poses as an unassuming university professor before meeting his match in Kate Galvin (Charlotte Ritchie). At each turn, the globe-hopping saga of murderous obsession has become more and more unsettling. In the fifth and final season, Joe returns to New York with his new wife, Kate, but the darkness and brutality that's followed him around the world is never far behind. Often shocking, You is a gripping thriller that hits the same sinister sweet spot as early (read: good) seasons of Dexter.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nBlack Mirror returns with six new episodes that continue to explore humanity’s complicated relationship with technology. Although the new, seventh season includes a couple of rare sequels to previous Black Mirror episodes, the anthology format means every episode remains accessible. That means you can jump right in with the heartbreaking “Eulogy,” where Paul Giamatti's Phillip dives through his own fractured memories of a lost lover. Or you can start with the sinister “Plaything,” in which a gaming journalist gets murderously obsessed with a strange life-sim game, partly inspired by series creator Charlie Brooker’s own background. (In a very meta twist, you can play the game for real.) Whether you’re a longtime fan or this is your first encounter with poignant tech dystopias, all of Black Mirror awaits your viewing.\n\nNorth of North\n\nYoung Inuk woman Siaja (Anna Lambe, True Detective: Night Country) married straight out of high school, then spent years trapped in the shadow of her shallow, selfish husband, Ting—the golden boy of their small town of Ice Cove, nestled far in the Arctic Circle. A brush with death—and possibly the goddess Nuliajuk—gives her the push to make a fresh start, but an explosive breakup in a community of only 2,000 people means Siaja’s personal life is now everyone’s business. Netflix’s first Canadian original series, this sharp sitcom is packed with warmth and humor, while its on-location shooting in Iqaluit (the real-life capital of the Arctic Canadian territory of Nunavut) delivers breathtaking natural beauty along with the laughs.\n\nDevil May Cry\n\nBuilding on the success of Castlevania, Netflix’s take on Capcom’s Devil May Cry series continues the streamer’s strong track record of animated video game adaptations. For those who've never picked up a controller, the series follows half-demon devil hunter Dante, a stylish slayer with a penchant for slicing up hell's worst offenders. This eight-episode spectacular sees Dante (voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch) clashing with the horrific White Rabbit (Hoon Lee), a twisted monster aiming to tear down the barrier between Earth and hell. Animation fans will also appreciate one of the final performances from the venerable, sadly-passed Kevin Conroy as the villainous US Vice President Baines. Devil May Cry may be unashamedly in love with its own early 2000s origins—as evidenced by a soundtrack filled with songs from the likes of Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach—but this slickly animated action masterpiece is a hellishly good time.\n\nAdolescence\n\nA quiet English town. 6 am. Police raid the house of Jamie Miller on suspicion of murdering an innocent girl. Jamie is 13 years old. A shocking mini-series, this isn't a whodunit, but a whydunit. Its four episodes—each masterfully shot in a single real-time take—explore how boys are radicalized online to hate women, and the horrifying effects it has. The powerhouse cast includes cocreator and writer Stephen Graham (Bodies, A Thousand Blows) as Jamie's father Eddie, Ashley Walters (Bulletproof) as Detective Boscombe, the arresting officer and investigator of Jamie's crime, and Erin Doherty (The Crown) as the psychologist evaluating Jamie. Each brings this incredibly difficult material to life, but it's newcomer Owen Cooper as Jamie who most astounds, turning from petrified to cheeky to vitriolic in a terrifying heartbeat. Adolescence is harrowing but important viewing.\n\nPantheon\n\nOriginally an AMC+ show, both seasons of Pantheon are now available on Netflix. Good timing too, since its nightmarish scenario of digitally uploaded human consciousnesses and exploration of the impact such technology would have on society feels worryingly prescient. With plot threads weaving between isolated Maddie Kim, whose dead father may have been reborn as an “Uploaded Intelligence,” Caspian Keyes, a genius teenager whose entire life is a Truman Show–style lie, and Vinod Chanda, an engineer investigating UI, this hard sci-fi outing—based on the short fiction of Ken Liu—offers a dark examination of virtual immortality. A uniquely brilliant adult animated series.\n\nZero Day\n\nCards on the table: A significant part of the appeal here is seeing the iconic Robert De Niro in his first major English-language TV role (he previously appeared in the Argentinian Nada, aka Nothing). He doesn't disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that \"this will happen again\"—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch.\n\nThe Night Agent\n\nSpecial agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America's intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller.\n\nAsura\n\nThe four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other's throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld\n\nYou know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years.\n\nA Man on the Inside\n\nThe latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who's lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles' fish-out-of-water situation, it's a show that's equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it's based on a true story, to boot.\n\nBlack Doves\n\nHelen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she's actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen's obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it's a brisk watch too.\n\nArcane\n\nAnimated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nHeartstopper\n\nOne of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper's return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality.\n\nThe Boyfriend\n\n\"Anyone can fall in love with anyone\" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan's first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who'll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV.\n\nKleo\n\nIf you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you'd expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that's only heightened in the second season as Kleo's pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War.\n\nSupacell\n\nOne by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it's Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée's life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you'll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre.\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T12:51:20.312974"}

It seemed like there was a never-ending list of incredible indie games to try — The Verge wrote about a lot of them! — and many worked brilliantly on Valve’s handheld gaming PC. Some bigger games made a splash on Steam Deck, too, and while they may not look as good as on a beefy PC, I’m usually happy to deal with that simply because I can play them on the couch or out of the house.\n\nIf you’re unwrapping a Steam Deck for the holidays this year, or have some Steam gift cards burning a hole in your pocket, here are some of my recommendations of games released in 2025 that you might want to check out. (And if you want more ideas, check out my favorites from 2024.)\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nBall x Pit\n\nBall x Pit blends elements from games like Breakout, Vampire Survivors, and city builders into a delightful, genre-blending roguelike. In the main part of the game, you shoot balls toward an ever-advancing group of enemies, and after picking up a bunch of gems and upgrades, you’ll eventually turn into a force of nature with balls flying all over the screen. After a run, you can build up a base to improve your stats and unlock characters — some of which are quite clever, like one that turns Ball x Pit into a turn-based game. And with runs usually taking less than 15 minutes or so, it’s a great game to pick up and play on your Steam Deck.\n\nImage: Kepler Interactive\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33\n\nSandfall Interactive’s debut RPG floored me earlier this year; it’s an outstanding package with exhilarating turn-based battles, a great parrying system, memorable characters, a gripping story, and music that I still come back to even though I finished the game months ago. On Steam Deck, the game doesn’t look quite as good as it does on my PS5, but it’s still playable and was recently verified for Valve’s handheld PC. Folks on ProtonDB also have some suggestions to tweak settings to make the visuals better. If Steam Deck is your only platform that can play the game, it’s still a decent place to experience The Game Awards’ Game of the Year.\n\nImage: Supergiant Games\n\nHades II\n\nI know I put Hades II on my version of this list last year, but the roguelike got its big 1.0 update in September, and it’s damn good. Supergiant Games builds on the first Hades with a new protagonist, new boons to bring to battle, a bunch of new characters to give ambrosia to, two new routes to explore, and another banger-filled soundtrack. Supergiant even tweaked the ending to make it better. Hades II is Supergiant at the top of its game, and just like my colleague Ash Parrish said in 2024, it’s the perfect Steam Deck game.\n\nImage: Team Cherry\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n\nAfter years of waiting and lots of clown makeup, Hollow Knight’s sequel finally launched in September, and thankfully, it was actually worth the wait. Silksong doesn’t reinvent the wheel; it’s still an atmospheric Metroidvania with adorable bug creatures, tough-as-nails bosses, and some bullshit. But I loved that formula in the original Hollow Knight, and it’s still excellent in Silksong.\n\nImage: Poti Poti Studio / Wholesome Games Presents\n\nIs This Seat Taken?\n\nIf you’re looking for some relaxing puzzles, pull up a chair with Is This Seat Taken?. In the game, you’re responsible for finding seats for a bunch of adorable geometric shapes who have different needs. Some might want to sit next to a window, or maybe just not next to someone who smells. But if you can’t find a seating arrangement that works for everyone, you can just move on to the next puzzle without any big penalty; it keeps the stakes low, and sometimes, some low-stakes puzzling is what fits the bill.\n\nImage: Enhance Games\n\nLumines Arise\n\nI have very fond memories of playing the original Lumines: Puzzle Fusion on a PlayStation Portable, and more than 20 years after the release of that game, the Tetris Effect-like Lumines Arise captures that same magic. The trance-y visuals, amazing music, and absorbing Lumines puzzling sucked me in and briefly let me forget about everything else in the world; like my colleague Andrew Webster, I found Arise to be an almost perfect zen puzzle game.\n\nImage: Pocket Trap / PM Studios, Inc.\n\nPipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo\n\nEarlier this year, I wrote that Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo would feel right at home on your Game Boy Advance — and that’s part of what makes it such a good fit for the Steam Deck. The game is a top-down adventure where you battle enemies and explore the game’s world with a magical yo-yo, and you’ll get cool yo-yo tricks like the ability to “walk the dog” to cross bodies of water. With excellent pixel art and music filled with blaring horns, it feels like a spiritual successor to the GBA games I loved growing up.\n\nImage: Powerhoof\n\nThe Drifter\n\nThe Drifter is inspired by the old-school LucasArts point-and-click adventure game formula, but instead of telling a silly, Monkey Island-like story, it cleverly turns the format into a dark, gripping thriller. You can play with a mouse to point and click, of course, but if you want to use the Steam Deck’s controls or a gamepad, The Drifter also offers a really smart control scheme that uses both joysticks to let you walk around and see what you can interact with. The story is full of exciting, mind-bending twists. And if you’re anything like me, it will probably keep you up long after your bedtime.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-27T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T13:32:38.601696"}

Many of our favorite discounts from the past week are still hanging around, making this an especially convenient moment to shop. Whether you’re eyeing a new phone, gearing up for travel, or just looking to treat yourself before the year wraps up, we’re seeing notable price drops on Google’s Pixel 10 lineup, AirTags, and a wide selection of Nintendo Switch games, along with a handful of other Verge-approved picks worth grabbing now. Here are the best deals worth checking out before the year comes to a close.\n\nGoogle’s Pixel 10 phones are among the best Android phones you can buy, and this week they’ve dropped to some of their lowest prices yet. Amazon is selling the Pixel 10 for $499 ($300 off) with promo code PIXEL10, marking its second-best price to date. If you want better cameras, Amazon is also offering record-low prices on the Pixel 10 Pro and 6.8-inch Pixel 10 Pro XL, down to $649 ($350 off) and $799 ($400 off), respectively, with the same code.\n\nAll three phones support Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets and run on Google’s snappy Tensor G5 chip. In her review, The Verge’s Allison Johnson called the Pixel 10 a great, basic Android phone with meaningful upgrades, including a bright 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness. It also adds a dedicated telephoto lens — a first for a non-Pro Pixel — which makes a noticeable difference for portraits.\n\nIf you’re aiming for great (not just good) photos, though, the 6.3-inch Pixel 10 Pro or 6.8-inch Pro XL are better picks. Both offer improved main and 48-megapixel ultrawide cameras, and additional AI-powered features like Pro Res Zoom and an upgraded portrait mode. They also come with extra memory for smoother multitasking along with sharper displays.\n\nAnker Laptop Power Bank $ 88 $ 120 27 % off $ 88 Anker’s 25,000mAh power bank sports two built-in USB-C cables (one of which is retractable), plus one USB-C and USB-A port. It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four. Read More $88 at Amazon$88 at Walmart\n\nAnker’s Laptop Power Bank is once again on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $87.99 ($47 off), which matches the record-low price we last saw a month ago. A favorite among Verge staffers, the 25,000mAh / 90Wh power bank features a retractable USB-C cable along with a second built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a handle for easier portability. You also get a handy LCD screen that shows remaining battery life, total power output, and temperature at a glance. It includes a USB-A port and an extra USB-C port as well, letting you charge a MacBook Pro and up to three other devices at the same time. Power output tops out at 165W when charging two devices, or up to 130W with more plugged in — and since it’s carry-on compliant, you can bring the power bank along on flights.\n\nThe deals aren’t limited to Nintendo’s own catalog, either. A number of well-known third-party games are included as well, from popular releases like Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition ($39.99 down from $69.99) to game of the year contenders such as Hades 2 ($22.49, down from $29.99) and Hollow Knight: Silksong ($15.99, down from $19.99). Just mark your calendar — most of these deals run through January 4th.\n\nA few more deals we’re digging:", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-27T11:07:03-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T16:31:05.070594"}

This is how they operate.", "content": "For more than a decade, dozens of journalists and human rights activists have been targeted and hacked by governments all over the world. Cops and spies in Ethiopia, Greece, Hungary, India, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates, among others, have used sophisticated spyware to compromise the phones of these victims, who at times have also faced real-world violence being intimidated, harassed, and in extreme cases, even murdered.\n\nIn the last few years, in the fight to protect these higher-risk communities, a team of a dozen digital security experts, mostly based in Costa Rica, Manila, and Tunisia, among other places, have played a key role. They work for the New York-headquartered nonprofit Access Now, specifically its Digital Security Helpline.\n\nTheir mission is to be the team of people who journalists, human rights defenders, and dissidents can go to if they suspect they’ve been hacked, such as with mercenary spyware made by companies like NSO Group, Intellexa, or Paragon.\n\n“The idea is to provide this 24/7 service to civil society and journalists so they can reach out whenever they have… a cybersecurity incident,” Hassen Selmi, who leads the incident response team at the Helpline, told TechCrunch.\n\nAccording to Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab who has been investigating spyware for almost 15 years, Access Now’s Helpline is a “frontline resource” for journalists and others who may have been targeted or hacked with spyware.\n\nThe helpline has become a critical funnel for victims. So much so that when Apple sends its users a so-called “threat notification” alerting them that they have been targeted with mercenary spyware, the tech giant has long directed victims to Access Now’s investigators.\n\nIn speaking with TechCrunch, Selmi described a scenario where someone gets one of these threat notifications, and where Access Now can help victims.\n\n“Having someone who could explain it to them, tell them what they should do, what they should not do, what this means… This is a big relief for them,” said Selmi.\n\nAccording to several digital rights experts who have investigated spyware cases and previously spoke with TechCrunch, Apple is generally taking the right approach, even if the optics look like a trillion-dollar tech giant offloading its responsibility to a small team of nonprofit workers.\n\nBeing mentioned by Apple in the notifications, said Selmi, was “one of the biggest milestones” for the helpline.\n\nSelmi and his colleagues now look into about 1,000 cases of suspected government spyware attacks per year. Around half of those cases turn into actual investigations, and only around 5% of them, around 25, result in a confirmed case of spyware infection, according to Mohammed Al-Maskati, the helpline’s director.\n\nWhen Selmi started doing this work in 2014, Access Now were only investigating around 20 cases of suspected spyware attacks per month.\n\nAt the time, there were three or four people working in each timezone in Costa Rica, Manila, and Tunisia, locations that allowed them to have someone online throughout the whole day. The team isn’t that much bigger now, with fewer than 15 people working for the helpline. The helpline has more people in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan region, given that these are hotspots for spyware cases, according to Selmi.\n\nThe increase in cases, Selmi explained, is due to several circumstances. For one, the helpline is now more well known, so it attracts more people. Then, with government spyware going global and becoming more available, there are potentially more cases of abuse. Finally, the helpline team has done more outreach to potentially targeted populations, finding cases of abuse they may not have found otherwise.\n\nContact Us Have you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware? Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you.

Then, the investigators assess the case in triage. If a case is prioritized, the investigators ask questions, such as why the person believes they were targeted (if there was no notification), and what device they own, which helps to establish what kind of information the investigators may need to collect from the victim’s device.\n\nAfter an initial, limited check of the device performed remotely over the internet, the helpline’s handlers and investigators may ask the victim to send more data, such as a full backup of their device, to do a more thorough analysis examining for signs of intrusions.\n\n“For each known kind of exploit that has been used in the last five years, we have a process on how to check that exploit,” said Selmi, referring to known hacking techniques.\n\n“We know more or less what is normal, what is not,” said Selmi.\n\nThe Access Now handlers, who manage communication and often speak the victim’s language, will also give the victim advice on what to do, such as whether to get another device, or take other precautions.\n\nEvery case that the nonprofit looks into is unique. “It’s different from person to person, from culture to culture,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “I think we should do more research, get more people on board — not just technical people — to know how to deal with these kinds of victims.”\n\nSelmi said that the helpline has also been supporting similar investigative teams in some regions of the world, sharing documentation, knowledge, and tools, as part of a coalition called CiviCERT, a global network of organizations that can help members of civil society who suspect they were targeted with spyware.\n\nSelmi said this network has also helped to reach journalists and others in places where otherwise they could not get to.\n\n“No matter where they are, [victims] have people who could talk to and report to,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “Having these people talk their language and know their context helped a lot.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T18:35:40.695815"}

Fewer rounds are getting funded but deal sizes have grown, said Green citing a study.\n\n“It has never been easier to start a company, and it has never been harder to build something that is defensible,” Stanton said.\n\nFor Zeb, GV uses a specific formula to evaluate companies. The firm analyzes whether startups have achieved product-market fit, examining demand patterns to ensure every quarter outperforms the last. “That sequence should be happening consistently,” he said.\n\nStanton echoed this priority. “Can you prove that you can repeatedly sell? Can you prove that you can repeatedly grow in a big and growing market?”\n\nBut Green cautioned that not every company should pursue venture-scale growth. “It’s not worth even taking this money unless you think it can be a really big business, right?” he said. “Most companies should not [pursue] venture scale. They should not take hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Stanton said she is looking for passionate founders who can endure the long journey of building a company. Zeb agreed. “Passion is still the most important thing,” he said.\n\nThe panel inevitably turned to AI. Green assured non-AI companies: “Just because you’re not AI doesn’t mean you don’t have a very attractive asset, intrinsic quality to you,” he said.\n\nFor AI companies trying to differentiate in a crowded market, Green returns to first principles. “We try to understand, if it’s a market with a lot of competition — [including] both incumbents and next-gen competitors and platform players — what is going to be the standout path?”\n\nStanton said she looks founders who combine industry and technical expertise, while Zeb prioritizes relentless drive, seeking founders who are constantly asking how to move faster than the competition.\n\nDespite market fluctuations, the panel suggested that core investor priorities remain consistent. “The bar is high, but if the outcome can be impossibly huge, we’ll take that [bet],” Green said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 19:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T19:23:19.614951"}

The Frame TV is the most famous example, but the company also released the Music Frame, a speaker disguised as a picture frame, at last year’s CES. Now, instead of hiding a speaker with a piece of art, Samsung worked with designer Erwan Bouroullec to make a speaker into a piece of art.\n\nAccording to Samsung, the Music Studio line of speakers, debuting at CES 2026, draw inspiration from the “timeless dot concept” found throughout music and art.

The number of startup funding rounds fell by nearly 39% from a year earlier, to 1,518 deals, according to Tracxn. Total funding slipped more modestly — down just over 17% to $10.5 billion.\n\nThat pullback was not uniform. Seed-stage funding fell sharply to $1.1 billion in 2025, down 30% from 2024, as investors cut back on more experimental bets. Late-stage funding also cooled, slipping to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline from last year, amid tougher scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved more resilient, rising to $3.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits:Tracxn\n\n“The capital deployment focus has increased towards early-stage startups,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, pointing to growing confidence in founders who can demonstrate stronger product–market fit, revenue visibility and unit economics in a tighter funding environment.\n\nThe AI quest\n\nNowhere was that recalibration clearer than in AI, as AI startups in India raised just over $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from a year earlier, per Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. The capital was mainly spread across early and early-growth stages. Early-stage AI funding totaled $273.3 million, while late-stage rounds raised $260 million, reflecting investor preference for application-led businesses over capital-intensive model development.\n\nThis was in sharp contrast to the U.S., where AI funding in 2025 surged past $121 billion across 765 rounds, per Tracxn, a 141% jump from 2024, and was overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals.\n\n“We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India, which is $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame, and that is globally happening,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nIndia, Swaroop told TechCrunch, lacks large foundational model companies and will take time to build the research depth, talent pipeline, and patient capital needed to compete at that layer — making application-led AI and adjacent deep-tech areas a more realistic focus in the near term.\n\nThis pragmatism has shaped where investors are placing longer-term bets outside core AI. Venture capital is increasingly flowing into manufacturing and deep-tech sectors. These are some of the areas where India faces less global capital competition and has clear advantages in talent, cost structures, and customer access.\n\nWhile AI now absorbs a significant share of investor attention, capital in India arguably remains more evenly distributed than in the U.S., with substantial funding still flowing into consumer, manufacturing, fintech, and deep-tech startups. Swaroop noted that advanced manufacturing in particular has emerged as a long-term opportunity, with the number of such startups increasing nearly tenfold over the past four to five years — an area he described as a clear “right to win” for India given lower global capital competition.\n\nRahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, said AI startups accounted for roughly 30–40% of deals in India in 2025, but pointed to a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies as changing behaviour among India’s urban population creates demand for faster, more on-demand services — from quick commerce to household services — categories that play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley–style capital intensity.\n\nIndia versus the U.S.\n\nData from PitchBook shows a stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the U.S. in 2025. U.S. venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, according to PitchBook data up to December 23, compared with about $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period.\n\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n\nHowever, that gap does not tell the whole story.\n\nLightspeed’s Taneja cautioned against drawing direct parallels between India and the U.S., arguing that differences in population density, labour costs, and consumer behaviour shape which business models can scale. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found far greater traction in India than in the U.S., reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors.\n\nRecently, Lightspeed raised $9 billion in fresh capital with a strong focus on AI, but Taneja said the move does not signal a wholesale shift in the firm’s India strategy. The U.S. fund, he noted, is geared toward a different market and maturity cycle, while Lightspeed’s India arm will continue backing consumer startups alongside selectively exploring AI opportunities shaped by local demand rather than global capital intensity.\n\nNuances in India’s startup ecosystem\n\nIndia’s startup ecosystem also saw funding for women-led startups tighten. Capital invested in women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at about $1 billion in 2025, down 3% from a year earlier, according to Tracxn’s report. Still, that headline figure masked a sharper pullback beneath the surface. The number of funding rounds in women-founded startups fell by 40%, while their first-time funded counterparts declined by 36%.\n\nIndia’s women-led startups saw a 3% dip in funding in 2025 Image Credits:Tracxn\n\nOverall, investor participation narrowed sharply as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors taking part in funding rounds in India this year, a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier, according to Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of that activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating — a sign that local capital played a more prominent role as global investors turned cautious.\n\nActivity also became more concentrated among a smaller group of repeat backers. Inflection Point Ventures emerged as the most active investor, participating in 36 funding rounds, followed by Accel with 34, Tracxn data shows.\n\nThe Indian government’s participation in the startup ecosystem became more visible in 2025. New Delhi announced a $1.15 billion Fund of Funds in January to expand capital access for startups, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme aimed at areas such as energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI, using a mix of long-term loans, equity infusions and allocations to deep-tech funds.\n\nThat push has begun to catalyze private capital as well. The government’s growing involvement helped spur a nearly $2 billion commitment from U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep-tech startups — an effort that also brought Nvidia on board as an adviser and drew Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the Indian government also co-led a $32 million funding for quantum computing startup QpiAI earlier this year — a rare federal move.\n\nThis growing state involvement has helped ease a risk long flagged by investors: regulatory uncertainty. “One of the biggest risks you don’t want to underwrite is what happens if regulation changes,” said Taneja of Lightspeed.\n\nAs government entities become more familiar with the startup ecosystem, Taneja added, policy is more likely to evolve alongside it — reducing uncertainty for investors backing companies with longer development cycles.\n\nExits in India\n\nThe reduced uncertainty has already started to show up in exit markets to some extent. India saw a steady pipeline of technology IPOs over the past two years, with 42 tech companies going public in 2025, up 17% from 36 in 2024, per Tracxn. Much of the demand for those listings has come from domestic institutional and retail investors, easing long-standing concerns that Indian startup exits depend too heavily on foreign capital. M&A activity also picked up, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals, Tracxn data shows.\n\nSwaroop of Accel said investors had long worried that India’s public markets were mainly sustained by foreign capital, raising questions about exit durability during global downturns. “This year has disproven that,” he said, pointing to the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings — a shift that has made exits more predictable and reduced reliance on volatile overseas flows.\n\nImage Credits:Tracxn\n\nIndia’s unicorn pipeline in 2025 also reflected that shift toward restraint. While the number of new unicorns remained flat year over year, Indian startups reached $1 billion valuations with less capital, fewer funding rounds, and a smaller pool of institutional investors, pointing to a more measured path to scale compared with both previous years and global peers.\n\nChallenges remain as India heads into 2026, particularly around how it positions itself in the global race for AI and whether late-stage funding can deepen without relying on outsized capital inflows.\n\nEven so, the shifts seen in 2025 point to a startup ecosystem that is maturing rather than retreating — one where capital is being deployed more deliberately, exits are becoming more predictable, and domestic market dynamics increasingly shape its growth. For investors, India is emerging less as a substitute for developed markets and more as a complementary arena with its own risk profile, timelines, and opportunities.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T02:25:39.948638"}

Most meals come together in 15 or 20 minutes, in my experience—unless they need time in the oven. A bot concierge and pre-mixed sauces do cost a bit, however, and that’s where Hungryroot promo codes come in.

{"title": "Behold the Manifold, the Concept that Changed How Mathematicians View Space", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/behold-the-manifold-the-concept-that-changed-how-mathematicians-view-space/", "summary": "In the mid-19th century, Bernhard Riemann conceived of a new way to think about mathematical spaces, providing the foundation for modern geometry and physics.", "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nStanding in the middle of a field, we can easily forget that we live on a round planet. We’re so small in comparison to the Earth that from our point of view, it looks flat.\n\nThe world is full of such shapes—ones that look flat to an ant living on them, even though they might have a more complicated global structure. Mathematicians call these shapes manifolds. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space. It was no longer just a physical setting for other mathematical objects, but rather an abstract, well-defined object worth studying in its own right.\n\nThis new perspective allowed mathematicians to rigorously explore higher-dimensional spaces—leading to the birth of modern topology, a field dedicated to the study of mathematical spaces like manifolds. Manifolds have also come to occupy a central role in fields such as geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis, and physics.\n\nToday, they give mathematicians a common vocabulary for solving all sorts of problems. They’re as fundamental to mathematics as the alphabet is to language. “If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian?” said Fabrizio Bianchi, a mathematician at the University of Pisa in Italy. “No. But try to learn Russian without learning Cyrillic.”\n\nSo what are manifolds, and what kind of vocabulary do they provide?\n\nIdeas Taking Shape\n\nFor millennia, geometry meant the study of objects in Euclidean space, the flat space we see around us. “Until the 1800s, ‘space’ meant ‘physical space,’” said José Ferreirós, a philosopher of science at the University of Seville in Spain—the analogue of a line in one dimension, or a flat plane in two dimensions.\n\nIn Euclidean space, things behave as expected: The shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. A triangle’s angles add up to 180 degrees. The tools of calculus are reliable and well defined.\n\nBut by the early 19th century, some mathematicians had started exploring other kinds of geometric spaces—ones that aren’t flat but rather curved like a sphere or saddle. In these spaces, parallel lines might eventually intersect. A triangle’s angles might add up to more or less than 180 degrees. And doing calculus can become a lot less straightforward.\n\nThe mathematical community struggled to accept (or even understand) this shift in geometric thinking.\n\nBut some mathematicians wanted to push these ideas even further. One of them was Bernhard Riemann, a shy young man who had originally planned to study theology—his father was a pastor—before being drawn to mathematics. In 1849, he decided to pursue his doctorate under the tutelage of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been studying the intrinsic properties of curves and surfaces, independent of the space surrounding them.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 07:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T07:29:52.681510"}

New, global alternatives are emerging.", "content": "2026 will be the year when US dollar dilution—the quiet erosion of its global dominance as countries trade and pay in alternatives—starts to build momentum. The more Washington uses the dollar as a weapon, the more the world builds ways to circumvent it.\n\nAmerica’s share of global trade has fallen from one-third in 2000 to just one-quarter today. As emerging economies trade more with each other, the dollar is less central to the flow of goods. Indian and Russian trade now settles in rupees, dirhams, and yuan. More than half of China’s trade now moves through CIPS, China’s own cross-border payment system, instead of SWIFT—the global messaging network long dominated by Western banks. Other trading partnerships like Brazil-Argentina, UAE-India, and Indonesia-Malaysia are also piloting local currency settlements.\n\nAt the same time, central banks around the world are starting to accumulate currencies other than the dollar as reserves. The dollar made up 72 percent of global reserves in 1999. Today, it’s down to 58 percent—and falling. A currency is safe only if it’s perceived to be safe. But perceptions are shifting.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.\n\nBallooning US fiscal deficits—projected at $1.9 trillion in 2025—together with a widening current-account gap, estimated at 6 percent of GDP, are adding pressure to the dollar. On top of this is the overuse of the “printing press,” meaning the creation of large amounts of new money to finance spending. Once cushioned by the dollar’s “exorbitant privilege” as the world’s dominant reserve currency, these trends now raise questions about global confidence in the greenback.\n\nEven the US Treasury market, once assumed to be infinitely liquid and universally acceptable as pristine collateral, has lost its luster. As of now, there is over $27 trillion in US Treasury bonds—loans from investors to the government, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States—circulating in the global financial system. That means more bonds to trade, more to settle, more to repo, and more to absorb on dealer balance sheets. But large financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman that have been primary dealers providing liquidity, haven’t scaled accordingly. Currently, if everyone wants to sell, there are not enough balance sheets to absorb the selling—unless the Fed steps in. This has been the case since the March 2020 Treasury market meltdown, which marked a historic failure of the world’s most liquid and trusted market—US Treasuries—to function in a moment of stress without central bank intervention.\n\nIn 2026, the real threat to the dollar may not come from a single rival currency. Instead, it will come from alternative payment and settlement systems built to bypass dollar-based channels—especially in emerging markets that never fully enjoyed the security of dollar liquidity or reliable access to dollar networks.\n\nThe race to design alternatives is taking off. One such alternative is mBridge—a project where central banks in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates are working with the Bank for International Settlements to build a system that lets countries pay each other instantly using their own digital versions of national currencies. Another is BRICS pay, which would allow BRICS+ countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and their new members—to send money to each other for trade and investment directly in their own currencies. These are meant to make trade faster, cheaper, and less dependent on the dollar.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T10:26:57.280951"}

In the same way that the Romans gradually amassed an empire of land spanning three continents and one-ninth of the Earth’s circumference, the CEO and his cohort are now dotting the planet with their own latifundia—not agricultural estates, but AI data centers.\n\nexpired: on-prem tired: “Big Data” wired: billion-dollar data centers Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nTech executives like Altman, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison are fully bought in to the idea that the future of the American (and possibly global) economy are these new warehouses stocked with IT infrastructure. But data centers, of course, aren’t actually new. In the earliest days of computing there were giant power-sucking mainframes in climate-controlled rooms, with co-ax cables moving information from the mainframe to a terminal computer. Then the consumer internet boom of the late 1990s spawned a new era of infrastructure. Massive buildings began popping up in the backyard of Washington, DC, with racks and racks of computers that stored and processed data for tech companies.\n\nA decade later, “the cloud” became the squishy infrastructure of the internet. Storage got cheaper. Some companies, like Amazon, capitalized on this. Giant data centers continued to proliferate, but instead of a tech company using some combination of on-premise servers and rented data center racks, they offloaded their computing needs to a bunch of virtualized environments. (“What is the cloud?” a perfectly intelligent family member asked me in the mid-2010s, “and why am I paying for 17 different subscriptions to it?”)\n\nAll the while tech companies were hoovering up petabytes of data, data that people willingly shared online, in enterprise workspaces, and through mobile apps. Firms began finding new ways to mine and structure this “Big Data,” and promised that it would change lives. In many ways, it did. You had to know where this was going.\n\nNow the tech industry is in the fever-dream days of generative AI, which requires new levels of computing resources. Big Data is tired; big data centers are here, and wired—for AI. Faster, more efficient chips are needed to power AI data centers, and chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have been jumping up and down on the proverbial couch, proclaiming their love for AI. The industry has entered an unprecedented era of capital investments in AI infrastructure, tilting the US into positive GDP territory. These are massive, swirling deals that might as well be cocktail party handshakes, greased with gigawatts and exuberance, while the rest of us try to track real contracts and dollars.\n\nOpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and SoftBank have struck some of the biggest deals. This year an earlier supercomputing project between OpenAI and Microsoft, called Stargate, became the vehicle for a massive AI infrastructure project in the US. (President Donald Trump called it the largest AI infrastructure project in history, because of course he did, but that may not have been hyperbolic.) Altman, Ellison, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son were all in on the deal, pledging $100 billion to start, with plans to invest up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. Nvidia GPUs would be deployed. Later, in July, OpenAI and Oracle announced an additional Stargate partnership—SoftBank curiously absent—measured in gigawatts of capacity (4.5) and expected job creation (around 100,000).", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T11:22:06.679051"}

Nearly all meals in Sakara's lineup are uncooked and preprepared—items like veggie burgers are without buns, lasagnas are “deconstructed.” For example, a “Lavender Quesadilla” has broccoli pesto and cashew “cheese” with hibiscus salsa … you get the idea. The menu is curated each week, and meals come in single servings. Sakara also has health supplements (which can be scientifically dubious), like a metabolism booster and fulvic acid cell reset. Sakara's signature nutrition program meal plan is designed to replace all meals and is delivered twice weekly. If you buy one week of five days, three meals a day, it's $465 per week; weekly subscriptions of five days, three meals a day, is $395 per week; prices go down to $141 per week with a 12-week subscription for three days at two meals per day. There's also a \"Level II: Detox\" program, starting at $465 per week. This meal kit seems fit for Gwyneth Paltrow or WAGs (wife or girlfriend of professional athletes) everywhere, but it wasn't the right fit for my budget and taste preferences.\n\nNutriFit\n\nNutriFit for $10 to $45 per meal: NutriFit is more like a personal chef than a meal-kit delivery service, specializing in nutrient-dense, fully prepared meals with a huge range of fare, with gluten- and dairy-free and vegetarian and vegan options. The company ships to the lower 48 states, and most meals hovered around $20. NutriFit has customized, chef-curated meal plans that are tailored for the eater and include specifics like health goals and dietary restrictions, where the customer can select their own meals on the Premium plan or have the curated meals from the 13-week rotating menu, starting at $19 per day. There are also à la carte options, which I tested, which range from $10 to $45 per meal. These don't require a subscription or a minimum, and come in meals that serve three to four people or in individual size Fit for ONE meals that feed one, where you choose from “Always Available Favorites” and rotating new specials. A lentil chickpea salad, cold udon noodles, hearty roasted tomato soup, and crispy vegan tacos were standouts. But I wasn't a huge fan of most of the chef-curated specials, and the food started to wilt or get mushy if not eaten within the first few days. The user interface of the service isn't the best or easiest to navigate, either.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nFresh! Meal Plan from $11 to $14 per meal: You can choose from 6, 10, or 14 meals per week, or order à la carte (which is a minimum of eight meals), ranging from $11 to $14 per meal, with the price lowering the more you order. It's got choices for keto, paleo, high-protein, dairy- and gluten-free, and vegan and vegetarian meals, and everything is preprepared and just needs to be microwaved (or air fried) for about three minutes. There were six vegan meals and four vegetarian meals at the time of writing, with a menu filter to easily see choices. The vegetarian coconut chia breakfast pudding and margherita breakfast pizza were standouts, the vegan crab cakes had a mushy consistency and almost cinnamon-like flavor, and the vegan blackened \"chickn\" and Cajun pasta was rubbery and lacked spice. Since testing several months ago, none of the plant-based meal choices has changed, so this may be best as a supplemental meal kit for plant-based eaters.\n\nNot Recommended\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nEat Clean for $9 to $13 per meal: This vegan meal delivery service would be best for someone who loves the taste and convenience of TV dinners. Eat Clean has a dozen plant-based heat-’n’-eat meals available, with availability to order six to 20 meals per week, ranging from six meals for $13 each to 20 meals at $9 each. Each meal comes in a plastic container and needs to be microwaved or heated for around three minutes. Many of the meals have very similar flavors—the tomato sauce base for the chili, spaghetti, and lasagna all tasted the same. The meals with sides often felt random: zucchini with mac and cheese and nuggets; a cornbread on the side of chili that tasted exactly like a cinnamon coffee cake (the flavors didn't go well together on that one). Like TV dinners, flavors were often one-note, and I opted to air fry to enhance mushy textures. This meal kit is nearly the same price as most I've tested, and the picks above are a whole lot tastier.\n\nAre Meal Kit Services Worth It? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The answer really depends on what you value, whether that's time, convenience, cost, or something else altogether, like finding new recipes or eating healthier. For me as a vegan, I find it a bit harder to find new recipes or where I can find the ingredients needed when I do find them. Cheaper meal-kit service plans hover around $13 per serving, with more expensive plans like Sakara at $400 for a full week of meals. For the cheaper meal plans like Green Chef at $12 with generous portions, the meal prices seem comparable to the cost of buying plant-based (often organic) groceries. WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage did a deep dive to find out: Are Meal Kits Cheaper Than Groceries in 2025? and the results surprised me. How I Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I ate and prepared at least three days' worth of meals or four meals minimum from each brand over the course of a week. If the brand had both frozen, microwavable meals and meal kits that needed to be prepared, I tested both. When I could, I let the brand curate the meals for me, going with what the algorithm chose rather than personal taste to get an unbiased look at the choices offered. For plant-based meal kits, I prepared them as indicated in the directions and didn't add any extra food items or seasoning, so I could taste them exactly as they were meant to be.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

New research finds that people who drink water from them on a daily basis ingest far more microplastics than those who don’t.", "content": "Sarah Sajedi was visiting Phi Phi Island, Thailand, when she was dazzled by the beautiful scenery of the Andaman Sea. However, when she looked down at her feet, she saw that the white sandy beach was covered with plastic debris, most of which was from plastic bottles.\n\nAfter many years in the business world as the cofounder of an environmental software company, the experience inspired Sajedi to become a researcher. She had always had a passion for waste reduction, but she realized that the problem was consumption itself.\n\nThus, as a doctoral student at Concordia University in Canada, Sajedi reviewed over 140 scientific papers to determine the effects of plastic bottles on the human body. She found that people ingest an average of 39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles per year from food and drinking water, and those who use bottled water on a daily basis ingest nearly 90,000 more microplastic particles into their bodies.\n\n“Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency, but it is not something that should be used in daily life,” Sajedi explains. “Even if there are no immediate effects on the human body, we need to understand the potential for chronic harm.”\n\nLong-Term Effects Remain a Mystery\n\nMicroplastics are plastic particles ranging in size from 1 micrometer (1/1,000 of a millimeter) to 5 mm. Nanoplastics are even smaller, less than one micrometer. These particles are invisible to the naked eye, but are constantly being generated during the manufacturing, storage, transportation, and decomposition of bottles.\n\nLow-quality plastics, in particular, are prone to release microscopic debris due to sunlight, temperature changes, and physical manipulation. Unlike other plastic particles that enter the body through the food chain, those derived from plastic bottles are of concern because they are ingested directly with drinking water.\n\nOnce in the body, microscopic plastics can enter the bloodstream and reach vital organs. This triggers a chronic inflammatory response and exposes cells to oxidative stress, which can lead to hormone system disturbances, impaired reproductive function, and damage to the nervous system. It has also been linked to various types of cancer. On the other hand, the long-term effects on health remain unclear, due to the lack of extensive testing and standardized measurement methods.\n\nSeveral analytical methods exist for detecting micro- and nanoplastics, but each has its own advantages and weaknesses. Some methods can detect extremely small particles but cannot determine their chemical composition, while others can analyze composition but miss the smallest particles.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 11:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T11:41:29.907156"}

(Once again, like in all things, Nintendo is the exception.)\n\nBut while lists like this will probably disappear as we get deeper into the era of everything being an Xbox, Sony still seems committed to high-quality exclusives. Here are its best of 2025.\n\nPhoto by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nPlayStation Portal\n\nAs software exclusivity goes the way of Sega’s console business, console makers have other ways to attract consumers to their part of the video game ecosystem. For Microsoft, it’s Game Pass; for Sony in 2025, it’s the PlayStation Portal. This year, Sony launched an update for the Portal that enables cloud streaming and making the device a must-have for PlayStation households. For $200, roughly half the price of a PS5, you essentially get a second one, able to play select games without the need to stream them from the console. The list of streamable games isn’t comprehensive, but there are over 2,000 of them, and the ability to play them on the go is a literal game changer.\n\nGet into a discussion with true Final Fantasy sickos about the top 10 games in the franchise, and you better have a lot of time and earplugs on your hands as everyone debates entries two through 10 — because No. 1, invariably, is Final Fantasy Tactics. Having finally played the game for the first time, taking advantage of the remaster Square Enix released this year, I get it. The best video games are often timeless while also able to speak to a specific moment, and Tactics’ story is and does exactly that.\n\nBut more than narrative, Tactics’ brilliance is also in its expansive job system that grants players a facsimile of godhood that’s so much fun to wield. The arithmetician class has the ability to cast any learned spell in the game instantly and without requiring mana. To offset the class’s ruinously slow speed, pair it with white mage to create the most diabolical unit in the history of strategy RPGs. Ramza Beoulve is just a guy trying to save the world, and FFT made me believe he can because I made his ragtag band of misfits into walking nuclear weapons.\n\nGhost of Yōtei\n\nSucker Punch’s sequel to Ghost of Tsushima plays things relatively safe. It doesn’t change things up dramatically but instead polishes the experience. Which means the experience isn’t all that different from its predecessor — that means lush landscapes to explore, lots of combat techniques to learn, and, uh, plenty of hot springs to bathe in — but everything feels more finely tuned this time around. That’s especially true of the game’s tale of revenge, which is both more gripping than the original and also gives the open-world experience some much-needed structure.\n\nThe original Death Stranding was so weird that half of the fun was just wrapping your head around the experience. I’m not sure I really understood it until I was almost done (if at all). The sequel is still plenty weird, but because it builds off of the previous game, it’s also much easier to understand from the get-go. It’s still a delivery simulator where you trek across a postapocalyptic landscape to get goods and people where they’re needed. But now the setting has shifted to Australia, which means there are new environmental elements to deal with — hello, sandstorms — along with a whole new cast of weirdo characters to meet, played by everyone from Elle Fanning to George Miller.\n\nBut don’t worry; the story is still as inscrutable as ever.\n\nBennett Foddy sure made you feel the “walking” part of this elaborate walking simulator. In Baby Steps, your job is to walk, and you do that by controlling every move involved in taking a step, down to the fine motor details. What results is a hilarious examination of human psychology, emotional maturity, and a newfound appreciation for just how hard it is to ambulate a body with nothing more than DualSense trigger buttons.\n\nWhen Lumines Arise was first announced, I made the mistake of asking, “Oh, is it a series or something?”, unfamiliar with Lumines’ days as a PSP powerhouse. My elders have never let me live that down, so I thought I’d see for myself what the game is.\n\nLumines Arise is Evil Dr. Tetris Effect Mean Bean Machine. Mean Bean Machine in that the game is played by globbing together matching blocks in two-by-two configurations. It’s part Tetris Effect because the game has an incredible synth / pop-house soundtrack that’s synced to the action, creating a full-body puzzle-playing experience. And evil in that the game is hard as shit. My skills as a Tetris player, limited though they are, just do not transfer to Lumines Arise. But! There is a flow state I can reach. Throughout playing, the shapes of the blocks will change from blocks, to eggs, to clocks, whatever, and I’ve found some patterns are easier to group than others. It’s interesting and fun to figure out what shapes make the game easier for me and which ones are impossible to configure.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-28T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T13:34:05.364974"}

(2026)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-melatonin-should-i-take-2026/", "summary": "Many people rely on the sleep aid melatonin to help them get a more restful night’s sleep. But is it safe? And how much is too much?", "content": "When you've worked in the sleep industry long enough, you're going to hear one question resurface time and time again: “How much melatonin should I take?” The answer will vary from person to person, and the best person to deliver it is your doctor.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not a doctor (although my family really wishes I were), but I am a certified sleep science coach and professional mattress tester of five years and some change. Over the years, I've conversed with and attended lectures by many medical professionals on sleep aids and supplements. I also asked David Kuhlmann of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to give insight into best practices when it comes to melatonin (and sleep supplements, for that matter).\n\nChill Pill\n\nFirst of all, let's back up. What is melatonin? It's the hormone your brain produces naturally as part of its circadian rhythm, or the internal clock your body has to keep you on a natural, daily sleep schedule. Your pineal gland is in charge of making it, and sunlight signals it to slow down production so you can wake up and go about your day. Though your brain is already producing melatonin, the idea of taking a supplement is that it jump-starts your sleep cycle.\n\nIf you've taken melatonin before and felt it didn't work for you, or are considering starting it, this is where you should consult your doctor. And do it before starting any supplement, melatonin included. You may be on medications that won't let it work as well, giving you the impression that you need more. Or you could experience side effects from mixing melatonin and medications. Let's avoid the late-night WebMD doomscrolls and check off that box first.\n\nSnake Oil or Sleep Supplement?\n\nAnother reason to talk to a licensed health care provider ahead of jumping on the melatonin train is that they can give you a tailored recommendation on how to go about getting melatonin, either in supplement or even nutritional form. Or, as Kuhlmann recommends to me, bypassing it altogether, for many reasons—one of which is possible unforeseen side effects, like GI upset. More on that in a minute.\n\nThe reality is, supplements are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. The University of Pennsylvania's Regulatory Review has reported that the FDA evaluates supplements on a dietary basis, pretty much like what is done for food or medication. According to Pieter Cohen in an interview for the American Medical Association, the FDA actually evaluates supplements as a “subcategory of food” and not medication. Kuhlmann corroborated this for me, emphasizing that “increased access” and the fact that brands are not as “tightly regulated” in the market have led to dangerous outcomes. He described the uptick in melatonin poisoning cases that medical professionals have seen over the past decade, primarily in kids under the age of 5.\n\nThere's a whole lot of gray area for what's OK and what's not before a product hits the market, and even after it's sold to customers. So if an extra (and questionable) ingredient weasels its way into the formula, and the supplement hits the market, there's not much the FDA can do besides send companies a warning letter to recall the supplement. It's the equivalent of shrugging, saying “Whoopsie, your fault,” and putting responsibility on a brand to make it right—which, as The Regulatory Review also points out, they don't always do.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:09:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T13:34:05.701532"}

MayimFlow's founder John Khazraee wants to change that.", "content": "The mania around data centers has a lot of companies looking to become “picks and shovels” providers, by building profitable businesses that are ancillary to the gold rush gigs of selling server access or training leading AI models.\n\nMayimFlow, the Built World stage winner at this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt, is a good example. The startup is focused on essentially one task: preventing damaging water leaks.\n\nData centers use a lot of water, and that water can present a big risk, even if a leak is small. Founder John Khazraee told TechCrunch that many data centers only have reactive solutions for water leaks. That can saddle companies with downtime and set them back millions of dollars if one occurs.\n\nKhazraee would know. He spent more than 15 years building infrastructure for IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. With MayimFlow, he’s developed a combination of IoT sensors and edge-deployed machine learning models that can detect signs of impending leaks.\n\n“I’ve noticed these issues in data centers, and the only solution they had was: ‘when the leak happens, we find out,’” he said in an interview. “Now you have to spend a lot of money to go remediate the situation. Now you got to turn off the servers. Now the data is being disrupted. So I decided to do something about it.”\n\nKhazraee assembled a small team with plenty of experience to take on this challenge. Jim Wong, MayimFlow’s chief strategy officer, has spent decades working with data centers. Chief technology officer Ray Lok has carved out a career in water management and IoT infrastructure.\n\nBeyond the scariest consequences of unnoticed water leaks, there’s an element of frugality to what Khazraee is trying to do with MayimFlow, which he said comes from his childhood.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Are you singing in there?’”\n\nAs he grew up, Khazraee said he found himself always thinking about how to make things more efficient — especially as he studied to become an engineer. In college, he worked at a facility that collected frying oil from restaurants and converted it to biodiesel. It was a “messy job,” he said, but he liked the end result.\n\nKhazraee is now trying to mix this penchant for frugality with the experience of his team. He believes they can give data center operators 24 to 48 hours of advanced warning that repairs will be needed.\n\nMayimFlow has collected a glut of sample data from various industrial water systems that allow them to make these kinds of predictions, he said. The company can provide sensors that can help monitor a water system or plug its machine learning models into existing ones if companies already have similar hardware.\n\nKhazraee said he wants to bring this solution beyond data centers to commercial buildings, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and possibly even utilities. In his eyes, any company that wants to spot leaks early, or optimize water usage, could be a customer.\n\nKhazraee thinks it’s such a big opportunity he’s turned down roles at multiple big tech companies while building MayimFlow over the last two years.\n\n“I really believe in the vision.

I didn’t opt for an Apple Watch because I wasn’t constantly active, I didn’t feel the need to check my notifications, and I didn’t want to think about charging the watch every day.\n\nThis year, I got a chance to test the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which made me feel like I might start wearing smartwatches again.\n\nI have always had a soft spot for circular watches. One of the first smartwatches I owned was the Moto 360, and I loved its rounded design.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 has a curved domed Actua 360 display with thinner bezels as compared to last year’s watch. I have the 41 mm watch as the test unit, but I would personally opt for the 45mm size for battery and a bigger display. The display is also brighter with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and that makes it easier to use in daylight.\n\nThe battery life is great on the Pixel Watch 4, even with the smaller size. I have managed to get more than a day’s use out of the watch on those days when I have lighter activities.\n\nImage Credits: Ivan Mehta\n\nThough the Pixel Watch 4 has a proprietary charger where you can place the watch on the cradle like a puck, the charging speed makes up for it.\n\nGoogle advertises that you can charge this watch from 0% to 50% in 15 minutes and from 0% to 100% in 45 minutes. While the real-life timing doesn’t exactly match these numbers, I saw charging times that came close to these figures.

Apart from calorie burns, there were no particular insights into sports-related movement. For the last 15 days, I started going to a gym, and apart from the treadmill and elliptical mode, there aren’t any specialized modes for particular gym equipment. Instead, you have to select from options for things like core training, weights, or a general workout mode, based on the workout you are doing.\n\nThe watch does have more features for someone who runs — but that’s not possible in Delhi weather with terrible AQI right now. It also detects cardio workouts after 15 minutes of continuous activities, but while walking, these have been hit or miss for me. Another measure that has been off for me has been floor count. On days, I’ve walked to a cafe, I’ve seen a very high count for that, and on days I have gone up to my terrace multiple times, the number of floors climbed is incorrect.\n\nI am not someone who used to wear my watch or band to sleep. With the Pixel Watch 4, I had to mentally train myself to keep the watch on so I could get a better understanding of sleep and readiness scores. After a few weeks of usage, I regularly wore my watch to sleep. However, you don’t get additional or actionable insights related to sleep or readiness score on the watch in the daily summary. You do get suggestions on the Fitbit app related to readiness, but that’s about it. With fitness apps adding more AI to their apps, Google needs to step up its game.\n\nImage Credits: Screenshot by Techcrunch\n\nGoogle’s new Material UI design for the watch is refreshing and matches the theme on my Pixel Fold. The weather app is very nice to look at for both hourly and day forecasts. My one gripe is that I wish the exercise app allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick start. I could raise my watch to talk to Gemini, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workout, I have not needed Gemini to be ever-present for me.\n\nI have been a fan of the recent Pixel Watch 4 update that lets me use the pinch gesture to dismiss notifications, play or pause videos or music, or even move my wrist to dismiss calls.\n\nThe gripes I had about the watch didn’t bother me in daily usage. The display is fantastic, the software and fitness experience overall are great, and the display, along with the new design, is an upgrade from the last generation.

This year, the company was caught in a controversy around using its users’ content to train AI models and had to backtrack on changes to its terms.\n\nAround this time, Nalden had creatives reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized that he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer with the original ethos of the service around simplicity. The service is called Boomerang, and you can use it to transfer files without logging in.\n\n“Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I’ve always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that is just, it’s all about user experience, it’s ease of use, it’s the simplicity of sharing something quickly, and that just saves time. You don’t need to sign up, you don’t need to verify via email,” Nalden told TechCrunch about the ethos of the service.\n\nImage Credits: Boomerang\n\nFor casual users, the non-login experience would be sufficient, but it has its limits. You can have 1GB of total space, and upload files of up to 1GB in size with a seven-day expiration. If you want a bit more, you can choose to create a free account. That will get you 3GB of total space with a file upload limit of 3GB per file. You’ll asl get access to your upload history, the ability to add and delete files anytime, and the ability to customize emojis on the page while sending the file.\n\nIf you want even more, there is a €6.99 per month paid tier, which will give you 200GB per space (folders) and 500GB total storage with a file upload limit of 5GB per file.

The Power Glove was ambitious, impressive, even important — one of the very first mainstream devices that let you control a game using your body instead of just your thumbs — but it was not good. In some ways, its not-good-ness is a key part of the story.\n\nThe Power Glove showed up in the late 1980s, at a complicated time for the gaming industry, when Nintendo was a hugely powerful force for the future of fun. But the Power Glove wasn’t really even a Nintendo product. It started as a research lark, became a toy, and only wound up with Nintendo’s name on it after a particularly fateful pitch meeting. Thanks to a remarkable marketing campaign, and the feeling that VR often gives of simply being the future, the Power Glove wound up a reasonable (if brief) business success. And you can draw a line from the Glove to some other hugely successful Nintendo products — and maybe even to the whole VR industry as we know it.\n\nOn this episode of Version History, our chat show about old technology, we dig into the story of the Power Glove. It is, somehow, both very brief and very long. David Pierce, Fandom’s Chris Grant, and Game File’s Stephen Totilo explore the projects that led to the Power Glove, the many (many) reasons it wasn’t a very good product, and the ways in which it changed the future anyway.

Building atmosphere.\n\nThings that HP Lovecraft was bad at: Writing dialog. Creating compelling characters. Not being a racist.\n\nAs a fan of horror in general, I can’t pretend that Lovecraft isn’t an important touchstone. But the man’s blatant racism is also impossible to ignore, especially since it often finds its way onto the pages of his stories. One of the most notorious is The Horror at Red Hook, which follows Detective Thomas Malone as he uncovers a sinister cult in the titular Brooklyn neighborhood.\n\nThe Ballad of Black Tom is a retelling of that story, but from the perspective of Charles “Tommy” Tester, a black man from Harlem who finds himself inadvertently stuck in the middle of one man’s quest for power and the police. The author, Victor LaValle, flips the explicitly xenophobic original, turning it into a commentary on police brutality, racism, and the psychological effects of living as an oppressed person. Lovecraft would have hated it.\n\nTommy is a hustler who we’re led to understand early in the book operates as a courier or a fixer to make ends meet. We’re also led to understand that Tommy is somewhat knowledgeable about magic and arcane artifacts. There’s no long-winded exposition dump to spell out the nature of the magic, nor are we spoonfed some explanation about how Tommy obtained this knowledge. It’s just an accepted fact of the world we’re dropped into.\n\nIn a longer book, this might be frustrating as you try to understand the logic behind its supernatural elements. But at 149 pages, The Ballad of Black Tom has no time to waste detailing a magic system, it has a story to tell.\n\nTommy embarks on a new hustle that leads him to Flatbush, where he hopes to make a few dollars busking, despite not being a particularly good musician. He is spotted by an elderly man named Robert Suydam, who hires him to play a party at his home. This exchange is witnessed by Officer Malone and a private detective, Mr. Howard, who shake Tommy down and attempt to scare him away from returning to Flatbush. Of course, the promise of $300 in the 1920s is too hard to pass up, and Tommy returns, allowing the rest of the story to unfold.\n\nWarning: Spoilers for The Ballad of Black Tom ahead.\n\nInterspersed between the conjuring of cosmic horrors at Suydam’s home, the assault on the cult compound in Redhook, and the police harassment, we get a handful of scenes with Tommy and his father, fleshing out characters in a way that Lovecraft never did. Tommy has an actual arc, motivations, and personality. When the climax of the book arrives, we’re fully invested in Tommy (who now goes by Black Tom).\n\nGetting attached to Black Tom is important because, well, he’s not the hero. In fact, there are no heroes in this story, really. There are villains, there are victims, but it’s hard to call anyone a hero. Black Tom lashes out at the white men who seek to exploit him and oppress him. It’s cathartic and satisfying as a reader, but his vengeance is also indiscriminate, and it’s implied it will lead to the end of all mankind.\n\nTommy Tester is a broken man at the end of the story. One who is so tired of the indignities of being a black man in a white man’s world that he would prefer the destructive indifference of the great old ones like Cthulu to the destructive indifference of systemic racism.\n\nThe Ballad of Black Tom is not a subtle book, but it’s also a quick and enjoyable read that takes the iconic Lovecraft mythos and gives it real heart. The Horror at Red Hook is not a particularly good story. It has almost no plot, its story arc is a straight line, and the characters have less depth than a sheet of looseleaf. The Ballad of Black Tom salvages what makes Lovecraft compelling, at least in theory (despite his awfulness as a person), and gives us something worth reading in the 21st century.\n\nThe Ballad of Black Tom is available on most e-book stores, but I highly recommend you go and buy a physical copy at your neighborhood independent bookshop or support your local library.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-28T14:45:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T19:53:20.268640"}

His co-founder Jack Abraham had experienced similar frustrations at his Miami Beach residence.\n\nIn 2024, they launched Sauron — named after the sinister, all-seeing eye from “The Lord of the Rings” — to build what they envisioned as a military-grade home security system for tech elites. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year.\n\nThe startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir, defense tech investors including 8VC, Abraham’s startup lab Atomic, and Hartz’s investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel.\n\nBut a year later, Sauron is still very much in development mode — a reality that its new CEO, Maxime “Max” Bouvat-Merlin, acknowledged candidly in a recent interview with TechCrunch.\n\nAfter nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. He’s spending his first days on the job finalizing fundamental questions: which sensors to use, how exactly the deterrence system will work, and when the company can realistically get products into customers’ homes.\n\nThe answer to that last question? Later in 2026 at the earliest — a significant delay from the original timeline.\n\n“We’re in the development phase,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “You’ll see a phased approach where we get our solution to market as a stepping stone.

Build everything in-house or partner with an ecosystem? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said.\n\nThe security problem\n\nBouvat-Merlin says he was drawn to Sauron by both the mission and an opportunity to solve a real customer problem. “Securing people’s homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people’s minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said.\n\nHis research showed that market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don’t respond because they assume it’s a false alarm.”\n\nThe company is targeting customers “where safety and security is a major concern” — people like Hartz. The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.”\n\nThe problem (that’s still taking shape)\n\nSo what exactly is Sauron building? The answer is still evolving. The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors — “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel.\n\n“Those people understand patterns,” he said. “They’re good at helping us mature our machine learning solution and train our system to detect weird behaviors.”\n\nThe deterrence system remains somewhat vague. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage.\n\n“The more upfront we are with deterrence, the more we can convince people this is the wrong house to rob and the wrong decision to make,” he said.\n\nAs for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. “These are roadmap conversations. I don’t want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we’re such a small company,” he said. He added that, bigger picture, the focus is on growing the ecosystem through partnerships rather than reinventing the wheel.\n\nTimeline and business model\n\nWith fewer than 40 employees, Sauron plans to hire just 10 to 12 more in 2026. The company will also begin working with early adopters later in 2026, with a Series A fundraise planned for mid-year.\n\n“Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it’s because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “I want to make sure we’re showing progress and explaining how we’ll use extra funds to accelerate growth, [including to] launch our first end-to-end product, drive customer adoption, and accelerate the roadmap.”\n\nThe company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron’s three founders, which include roboticist and engineer Vasumathi Raman. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.”\n\nBut Bouvat-Merlin is cautious about growth. “I want to make sure we grow sustainably and keep the experience and service premium over time,” he said. “I want to manage growing pains as much as possible while driving profitability.”\n\nThe surveillance state question\n\n\n\nFacial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. “I granted you access to my house, so now you’re in the trusted group. When you come, I detect it’s you and you’re allowed in. Everyone else is an unknown person,” he said, painting a picture of a likely scenario.\n\nLicense plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. “How do we assess if that’s a threat? The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said.\n\nEither way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead. Home security market is fragmented. ADT leads with roughly 18% market share, with competitors holding small pieces. “A lot of companies started as traditional security companies and are trying to add tech,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’re looking at it from the opposite angle — we’re a tech startup in San Francisco bringing technology to this market.”\n\nSauron is also appearing on the scene as concerns rise about crime among the most wealthy. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco’s Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats.\n\n“We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’ve seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. I don’t think the world is getting safer — there are probably more disparities between people at the top and bottom of the wealth spectrum. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”\n\n\n\nStill, much remains uncertain about Sauron’s path forward. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.)\n\nIt must also determine how to serve customers in different settings, from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality.\n\nFor now, Bouvat-Merlin says he’s focused on listening to his team, building credibility, and finalizing the strategy he’s putting in place. “I don’t demand that people trust me — I want to show them why they should.”\n\nThe company expects to share more details about its products later next year.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 02:20:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T02:22:28.571653"}

The 79-year-old president of the United States quite literally rules by decrees posted to his social network, Truth Social. The US government, meanwhile, is run by a ramshackle crew of former conspiracy theory podcasters, TV hosts, vaccine skeptics, and entertainment moguls. A decade ago, the prevailing advice was to never read the YouTube comments. Today, the human embodiment of YouTube comments are setting federal policy.\n\nBeyond members of the Trump administration (fair warning, there are quite a few on this year’s list), you’ll find some of the usual suspects: China’s state-backed hackers, chaos-making members of “the com” internet underworld, prolific online scammers, and of course, Elon Musk.\n\nEach year, we round up the people who have an outsized role in making the internet era feel like life itself is a relentless, unavoidable comments section—and who cause real-world harm from their digital perch. Here is our list for 2025.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nDonald Trump in 2025 reached what may well be his final form. Unleashed from the shackles of norms, decorum, and checks and balances, Trump's second administration is defined by a relentless pursuit of whatever it is Stephen Miller and Russell Vought think will Make America Great Again. But Trump is still the Poster-in-Chief, spewing an endless stream of attacks, insults, conspiracy theories, and AI slop on Truth Social.\n\nDuring one particularly prolific night in early December, the president of the United States posted 169 times between roughly 7 pm and midnight at the White House. They included calls for Congress to \"TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER\" and missives about Honduras' presidential election. Weeks prior, he’d posted that a video reminding US troops that they have a duty to disobey illegal orders was \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.\" When the president posts, it’s news—which means virtually everyone in the US must absorb the chaos Trump creates online.\n\nEvery day under Trump is like this, just as it has been for the better part of a decade. Cracks in Trump's social media armor have begun to show; Republicans notably pushed back on his callous comments after filmmaker Rob Reiner after he and his wife were found stabbed to death in mid-December. Still, Trump dominates nearly every news cycle and wields ever-expanding power to shape and ruin the lives of people in the US and abroad with a single Truth Social missive. If there's one principle Trump reliably holds, it's this: Never. Stop. Posting.\n\nThe Border Czars\n\nThe Trump administration's brutal, indiscriminate assault on people not born in the US (and even some who were) defined 2025 life in America: masked agents in riot gear lurking the streets, racially profiling pedestrians, and disappearing friends and loved ones into the bureaucratic tarpit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection custody. At the center of this profound remaking of America are White House adviser Stephen Miller and Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nAs deputy chief of staff for policy, Miller is widely considered the \"architect\" of Trump's anti-immigrant enforcement actions. He's the person who said on television that federal agents would arrest 3,000 people a day—an alleged \"quota\" that the administration denied existed, at least when forced to confront it in court. Without Miller, it's feasible your social networks—online and off—would be far less saturated with news and videos of lives being torn apart.\n\nNoem, meanwhile, has become the face of the administration's anti-immigrant enforcement policies. The DHS head oversees both ICE and CBP, and is thus directly responsible for how the crackdown on immigrants is conducted. This includes greater social media surveillance, a face recognition app that runs people through government databases, and casting public accountability of federal agents as illegal \"doxing.\" Under Noem, CBP has even proposed subjecting travelers to the US to a review of five years of social media posts.\n\nDOGE\n\nIt sounds like the premise of a sleazy cyberpunk novel: A team of largely young, inexperienced operatives connected to some of the most powerful men alive bypass normal background checks to access some of the US government’s most sensitive systems. One of their apparent main goals? Wiring together datasets to create a master database that could be used for a surveillance tool of unprecedented scope.\n\nThis is, of course, what actually happened this year, as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) seized control over much of the federal bureaucracy.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T10:36:43.579447"}

The increase from 2023 was small—0.8 percent—but still, global emissions continue to rise, despite science telling us we should have bent the global emissions' curve downward by 2020.\n\nThe emissions in our atmosphere are at work, heating the planet, acidifying our oceans, and leading to climate-fueled disasters: heat waves, fires, flooding, droughts, and storms. For some climate impacts, devastation can be followed by the painstaking work of recovery. But for many natural systems, like our tropical coral reefs, the stress we are putting on them is reaching the realms of permanent decline and ultimate collapse.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.\n\nAs we near 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming—the globally agreed upon limit of the Paris Agreement—we risk triggering tipping points. They are slumbering giants that in their healthy state dampen stress and cool the planet; systems with thresholds that, once crossed, lead to irreversible shifts, from dampening to amplifying stress, causing loss of resilience of the planet and accelerating the pace of change.\n\nOnce tipping points are crossed, there is also a nontrivial risk of dangerous cascades, where the first set of tipped systems have knock-on effects on other tipping elements, pushing them across their thresholds, triggering a domino sequence, and increasing further the likelihood of Earth drifting away from its stable state.\n\nMany tipping elements are now well-known: the Amazon rainforest, the Greenland Ice Sheet, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (or AMOC). But exactly at what level of warming they will cross their tipping points is still being investigated and narrowed down by science.\n\nFor some systems though, we have much higher certainty. Tropical coral reef systems—the rainforests of the ocean—are famous for their biodiversity, unimaginable richness in color and life, being the breeding ground for a myriad of fish species, and providing livelihoods for over 400 million people. They are also likely to be one of the first ecosystems we lose completely to climate change if we do not see a step change in action to reduce our emissions.\n\nThis would be devastating. In addition to their unique environmental significance, coral reefs are the ecological basis for massive sectors of the global economy, including tourism and fisheries, worth tens of billions of dollars. They are also vital natural protection for many coastal regions against storms and erosion.\n\nThe largest coral reef in the world and the richest marine ecosystem on Earth—the Great Barrier Reef in Australia—experienced another mass bleaching event in 2025. Bleaching is when corals expel the algae in their systems and turn a ghostly white. Corals are animals living in symbiosis with the algae, and while they can survive bleaching events, they need time to recover. Yet the Great Barrier Reef also experienced one in 2024.

What happens after receiving a threat notification?", "content": "It was a normal day when Jay Gibson got an unexpected notification on his iPhone. “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone,” the message read.\n\nIronically, Gibson used to work at companies that developed exactly the kind of spyware that could trigger such a notification. Still, he was shocked that he received a notification on his own phone. He called his father, turned off and put his phone away, and went to buy a new one.\n\n“I was panicking,” he told TechCrunch. “It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”\n\nGibson is just one of an ever-increasing number of people who are receiving notifications from companies like Apple, Google, and WhatsApp, all of which send similar warnings about spyware attacks to their users. Tech companies are increasingly proactive in alerting their users when they become targets of government hackers, and in particular those who use spyware made by companies such as Intellexa, NSO Group, and Paragon Solutions.\n\nBut while Apple, Google, and WhatsApp alert, they don’t get involved in what happens next. The tech companies direct their users to people who could help, but at which point the companies step away.\n\nThis is what happens when you receive one of these warnings.\n\nWarning\n\nYou have received a notification that you were the target of government hackers. Now what?\n\nFirst of all, take it seriously. These companies have reams of telemetry data about their users and what happens on both their devices and their online accounts. These tech giants have security teams that have been hunting, studying, and analyzing this type of malicious activity for years. If they think you have been targeted, they are probably right.\n\nIt’s important to note that in the case of Apple and WhatsApp notifications, receiving one doesn’t mean you were necessarily hacked. It’s possible that the hacking attempt failed, but they can still tell you that someone tried.\n\nA photo showing the text of a threat notification sent by Apple to a suspected spyware victim (Image: Omar Marques/Getty Images)\n\nIn the case of Google, it’s most likely that the company blocked the attack, and is telling you so you can go into your account and make sure you have multi-factor authentication on (ideally a physical security key or passkey), and also turn on its Advanced Protection Program, which also requires a security key and adds other layers of security to your Google account. In other words, Google will tell you how to better protect yourself in the future.\n\nIn the Apple ecosystem, you should turn on Lockdown Mode, which switches on a series of security features that makes it more difficult for hackers to target your Apple devices. Apple has long claimed that it has never seen a successful hack against a user with Lockdown Mode enabled, but no system is perfect.\n\nMohammed Al-Maskati, the director of Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, a 24/7 global team of security experts who investigate spyware cases against members of civil society, shared with TechCrunch the advice that the helpline gives people who are concerned that they may be targeted with government spyware.\n\nThis advice includes keeping your devices’ operating systems and apps up-to-date; switching on Apple’s Lockdown Mode, and Google’s Advanced Protection for accounts and for Android devices; be careful with suspicious links and attachments; to restart your phone regularly; and to pay attention to changes in how your device functions.\n\nContact Us Have you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware?

You can use the Mobile Verification Toolkit, or MVT, a tool that lets you look for forensic traces of an attack on your own, perhaps as a first step before looking for assistance.\n\nIf you don’t want or can’t use MVT, you can go straight to someone who can help. If you are a journalist, dissident, academic, or human rights activist, there are a handful of organizations that can help.\n\nYou can turn to Access Now and its Digital Security Helpline. You can also contact Amnesty International, which has its own team of investigators and ample experience in these cases. Or, you can reach out to The Citizen Lab, a digital rights group at the University of Toronto, which has been investigating spyware abuses for almost 15 years.\n\nIf you are a journalist, Reporters Without Borders also has a digital security lab that offers to investigate suspected cases of hacking and surveillance.\n\nOutside of these categories of people, politicians or business executives, for example, will have to go elsewhere.\n\nIf you work for a large company or political party, you likely have a competent (hopefully!) security team you can go straight to. They may not have the specific knowledge to investigate in-depth, but in that case they probably know who to turn to, even if Access Now, Amnesty, and Citizen Lab cannot help those outside of civil society.\n\nOtherwise, there aren’t many places executives or politicians you can turn to, but we have asked around and found the ones below. We can’t fully vouch for any of these organizations, nor do we endorse them directly, but based on suggestions from people we trust, it’s worth pointing them out.\n\nPerhaps the most well known of these private security companies is iVerify, which makes an app for Android and iOS, and also gives users an option to ask for an in-depth forensic investigation.\n\nMatt Mitchell, a well-regarded security expert who’s been helping vulnerable populations protect themselves from surveillance has a new startup, called Safety Sync Group, which offers this kind of service.\n\nJessica Hyde, a forensic investigator with experience in the public and private sectors, has her own startup called Hexordia, and offers to investigate suspected hacks.\n\nMobile cybersecurity company Lookout, which has experience analyzing government spyware from around the world, has an online form that allows people to reach out for help to investigate cyberattacks involving malware, device compromise, and more. The company’s threat intelligence and forensics teams may then get involved.\n\nThen, there’s Costin Raiu, who heads TLPBLACK, a small team of security researchers who used to work at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Group, or GReAT. Raiu was the unit’s head when his team discovered sophisticated cyberattacks from elite government hacking teams from the United States, Russia, Iran, and other countries. Raiu told TechCrunch that people who suspect they’ve been hacked can email him directly.\n\nInvestigation\n\nWhat happens next depends on who you go to for help.\n\nGenerally speaking, the organization you reach out to may want to do an initial forensic check by looking at a diagnostic report file that you can create on your device, which you can share with the investigators remotely. At this point, this doesn’t require you to hand over your device to anyone.\n\nThis first step may be able to detect signs of targeting or even infection. It may also turn out nothing. In both cases, the investigators may want to dig deeper, which will require you to send in a full backup of your device, or even your actual device. At that point, the investigators will do their work, which may take time because modern government spyware attempts to hide and delete its tracks, and will tell you what happened.\n\nUnfortunately, modern spyware may not leave any traces. The modus operandi these days, according to Hassan Selmi, who leads the incident response team at Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, is a “smash and grab” strategy, meaning that once spyware infects the target device, it steals as much data as it can, and then tries to remove any trace and uninstall itself. This is assumed as the spyware makers trying to protect their product and hide its activity from investigators and researchers.\n\nIf you are a journalist, a dissident, an academic, a human rights activist, the groups who help you may ask if you want to publicize the fact that you were attacked, but you’re not required to do so. They will be happy to help you without taking public credit for it. There may be good reasons to come out, though: To denounce the fact that a government targeted you, which may have the side effect of warning others like you of the dangers of spyware; or to expose a spyware company by showing that their customers are abusing their technology.\n\nWe hope you never get one of these notifications. But we also hope that, if you do, you find this guide useful.

The idea is you chat with it like you would chat with a friend, interruptions and all, even if the actual answers are the same as you'd get from typing your queries into Gemini as normal.\n\nNow, about a year and a half after its debut, Gemini Live has been given what Google is describing as its “biggest update ever.” The update makes the Gemini Live mode even more natural and even more conversational than before, with a better understanding of tone, nuance, pronunciation, and rhythm.\n\nThere's no real visible indication that anything has changed, and often a lot of the responses will seem the same as before too. However, there are certain areas where you can tell the difference that the latest upgrade has made—and so here's how to make the most of the new and improved Gemini Live.\n\nThe update is rolling out now for Gemini on Android and iOS. To access Gemini Live, launch the Gemini app, then tap the Live button in the lower right hand corner (it looks vaguely like a sound wave) and start talking.\n\nThe Gemini Live interface. David Nield\n\nHear Some Stories\n\nGemini Live can now add more feeling and variation to its storytelling capabilities—which can be useful for history lessons, bedtimes for the children, and creative brainstorming. The AI will even add in different accents and tones where appropriate, to help you distinguish between the characters and scenes.\n\nOne of Google's own examples for how this works best is to get Gemini Live to tell you the story of the Roman Empire from the perspective of Julius Caesar. It's a challenge for Gemini that requires some leaps in perspective and imagination, and to use tone and style appropriately in a way that Gemini Live should now be better at.\n\nYou don't have to restrict yourself to Julius Caesar or the Roman Empire either. You could get Gemini Live to give you a retelling of Pride and Prejudice from the perspective of each different Bennett sister, for example, or have the AI spin up a tale of what life would have been like in your part of the world 100, 200, or 300 years ago.\n\nLearn Some Skills\n\nAnother area where Gemini Live's new capabilities make a noticeable difference is in educating and explaining: You can get it to give you a crash course (or a longer tutorial) on any topic of your choosing, anything from the intricacies of human genetics to the best ways to clean a carpet. You can even get Gemini Live to teach you a language.\n\nThe AI can now go at a pace to suit you, which is particularly useful when you're trying to learn something new.

Just ask Kristi Noem.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security secretary has spent 2025 trying to convince the American public that identifying roving bands of masked federal agents is “doxing”—and that revealing these public servants’ identities is “violence.” Noem is wrong on both fronts, legal experts say, but her claims of doxing highlight a central conflict in the current era: Surveillance now goes both ways.\n\nOver the nearly 12 months since President Donald Trump took office for a second time, life in the United States has been torn asunder by relentless arrests and raids by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and federal, state, and local authorities deputized to carry out immigration actions. Many of these agents are hiding their identities on the administration-approved basis that they are the ones at risk. US residents, in response, have ramped up their documentation of law enforcement activity to seemingly unprecedented levels.\n\nexpired: opposing surveillance tired: getting surveilled by the cops wired: surveilling the cops \u0011\n\n“ICE watch” groups have appeared across the country.

From Los Angeles to Chicago to Raleigh, North Carolina, neighbors and passersby have pulled out their phones to document members of their communities being arrested and vanishing into the Trump administration’s machinery.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s new, of course. Documenting law enforcement activity to counter the he said, he said imbalance of power between police and civilians is practically an American tradition, says Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties nonprofit. “This goes back at least as far as the 1968 Democratic Convention when journalists documented police officers rioting and beating up protesters—and lying about who was responsible for this,” he says.\n\nJennifer Granick, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, says the practice likely goes back “centuries.” Indeed, documenting police activity is likely as old as policing itself. “The difference [today] is that technology has made it so everybody has a video recorder with them at all times,” Granick says. “And then it's very easy to get that recording out to the public.”\n\nNon-journalists recording police activity entered the mainstream after a bystander, George Holliday, videotaped Los Angeles Police Department officers brutally beating Rodney King, a Black man, in March 1991 and shared the footage with local media. The video would set off a national reckoning over race and policing in modern America.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T11:28:02.004097"}

But inconsistent app compatibility remained the [&#8230;]", "content": "is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.\n\nIn 2024, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips finally made Arm-based Windows laptops viable. Unlike previous Arm laptops that struggled to even run Windows well, this new class offered solid performance and the best battery life on Windows, and they impressed us in Microsoft’s own Surface Laptop and Surface Pro offerings. But inconsistent app compatibility remained the biggest hurdle to running Windows on Arm. (It forced me to use the watered-down Adobe Lightroom app instead of Lightroom Classic, and that’s a sin.) And playing games, one of Windows’ greatest strengths against the walled garden of Apple’s Macs, was basically a nonstarter.\n\nThroughout 2025, a slow burn of software improvements have taken the situation from pretty good to much better. Some creative apps that were absent from Windows on Arm now have native versions or run with Prism emulation. Adobe Premiere Pro works natively. And I found that Lightroom Classic, compatible in emulation, works just fine for light edits, even on lower-end Snapdragon X Plus chips.\n\nMore games work too, thanks to emulator improvements supporting x86 Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) and AVX2. Qualcomm even has a designated Snapdragon Control Panel for delivering prompt graphics driver updates, just like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. Epic’s Easy Anti-Cheat, used by Fortnite and other games, now works on Windows on Arm. And the Xbox game launcher now supports local game installs on Arm instead of only offering cloud streaming.\n\nMicrosoft’s entry-level 13-inch Surface Laptop is an easy recommendation, especially when it’s on sale. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge The 12-inch Surface Pro is still a little pricey once you factor in the keyboard and stylus, but it’s a great multipurpose tablet. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAt this point, I have no hesitation recommending a Windows on Arm laptop to friends and family as long as they don’t require specific software, like Ableton Live, that’s not yet compatible (and even Ableton is getting an Arm version in 2026). Or, if gaming is their highest priority and they’re better served by the Asus ROGs and Lenovo Legions of the world than a thin-and-light. In fact, I encouraged my sister to buy the 13-inch Surface Laptop while it was on sale for $550 during Black Friday. That’s such a good deal, and I’m confident it’ll be the quietest, most portable, most powerful, and longest-lasting laptop she’s owned yet.\n\nEven if you’re not upgrading from a 10-year-old laptop, the first generation of Snapdragon X chips offer battery life and standby times that were once unheard of for Windows laptops, especially coming off of a few especially bad generations of Intel processors. However, Intel’s Lunar Lake and AMD’s Strix Point chips took some of the wind out of Qualcomm’s sails when they launched a few months after, with competitive performance and nearly as good battery life.\n\nThe HP OmniBook 5 14 isn’t the speediest Arm laptop, but its lower tier Snapdragon X Plus processor gives it fantastic battery life at a more affordable price, even with a fancy OLED. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nIntel and AMD showed that the x86 architecture still has fight left in it. And as hype builds for 2026’s face-off between Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2, Intel’s Panther Lake, and AMD’s rumored “Gorgon Point,” we could be in for an even fiercer battle than usual. It could get more heated if Nvidia enters the fray.\n\nThere are rumors and leaked benchmarks indicating Nvidia is working on a new Arm-based chip to debut in a not-yet-announced Alienware laptop — in addition to whatever it’s cooking up with Intel for x86. The combination of Nvidia and Alienware points to an Arm chip with a big focus on graphics, much like AMD’s excellent Strix Halo on the x86 side. The integrated GPUs we’ve seen so far on Snapdragon chips aren’t powerful enough to run modern games at high settings, and Arm chips don’t yet support discrete GPUs. An Arm chip with Nvidia graphics could be pretty compelling for gamers.\n\nWindows on Arm had a good year. The gap between x86 and Arm Windows laptops is narrowing, and it’ll narrow further in 2026. Arm laptops are easier to recommend to more people, though x86 will still be the better choice for gaming for the foreseeable future.\n\n2026 will bring fresh challenges: not just new Intel and AMD chips, but fiercer competition from Linux, which also had a very good year. As Microsoft transforms Windows into an “agentic OS,” stuffing it with more semifunctional AI bloat, it risks further pissing off users, who might find greener pastures elsewhere. Maybe the question in 2026 won’t be “Should you buy a Windows on Arm laptop?” but “Should you buy a Windows laptop at all?”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-29T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:21.475078"}

It has a slot for easy brush removal if hair gets stuck around the bars, which is a helpful thing to have when you’re dealing with pet (and human) hair. The lever and the angle of the lid for emptying are counterintuitive, and the first few times I emptied it, the debris went everywhere. It’s hard to distinguish between eco and power modes, and the vac blinked red and the brush stopped rotating when transitioning between surfaces. (It especially had a hard time on my thin runner rug.) It felt a bit heavier and clunkier than others as well. But, it does have handy lights to illuminate debris and comes with attachments to make handheld cleaning a breeze.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nMova P50 Pro Ultra Robot Vacuum for $589: This robot vacuum-mop combo has extendable side brush and mop pads to reach tight corners, a self-emptying dock station that empties dust and debris, and self-cleans and dries mop pads. It also uses an RGB camera and “intelligent dirt detection system” whose sensors identify messes to clean deeper and avoid objects on the ground. The robovac generates 3D maps of your home, and identifies things like furniture and even pets. Through the app, you can customize cleanings, and there’s also synced video and voice interaction to allow you to talk to your pets, schedule cleanings, and more, and it is compatible with smart home devices Alexa and Google Home. When first mapping my small apartment, the vac didn’t want to go past certain rooms, and it took several days to get it to create a complete cleaning map. It has a hard time going over small thresholds, eventually avoiding cleaning the rooms altogether, and has thrown itself off my stairs twice, causing the mop pads to pop off. Despite having intelligent object detection, it still often tried to suck up or roll over small objects on the ground, like shoes and pet toys. I love that this combo vac-mop self-cleans and empties, but for nearly $1,000, I wish the smart features were smarter and the mapping was more accurate.\n\nDyson Car + Boat Handheld Vacuum for $250: Former WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar liked this handheld vacuum, designed specifically for sucking up dirt and debris from your car and boat, plus bedding, furniture, and other awkward spaces. (Read our full review here).\n\nHoover HL4 Pet Upright Vacuum Cleaner for £130: While it is only available in the UK, Hoover’s HL4 successfully removed lots of cat hair from my home. I live with a trio of cats, two of them long-haired, so a powerful vacuum is essential. The HL4 is sadly corded (7.6 meters), but at around 240 air watts it was powerful enough to lift dust and hair that my lightweight cordless vac and robot vac had missed. The smart design easily converts into a portable vacuum, and it comes with a pet tool and crevice tool. The pet tool proved adept at lifting hair from the couch, stairs, and cat beds, though it didn’t quite have the grunt to remove every strand. There’s a handy vent to reduce suction for mats and blankets. The 1.2-liter bin is easy to remove and empty, though not without releasing a dust cloud, and the Anti-Twist floor head seems to collect considerably less tangled hair than other vacuums. —Simon Hill\n\nNot Recommended\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nEufy RoboVac 11S Max for $150: Our esteemed competitors at places like The Strategist and Wirecutter loved this cheap robovac, so I bought one for myself before moving into my new apartment with two cats. And I have to say, I don't agree with them. Yes, this robovac is significantly cheaper than most others and has generally good ratings, but I have nothing nice to say about it besides that it is able to go under furniture and suck up pet hair I otherwise wouldn’t be able to. Its navigation system is random, it doesn't have an app (but it does come with a remote control to direct it to a specific spot or schedule cleanings), it’s loud, and it tends to be attracted to cords. It has extreme difficulty traversing even minor height differences, like the small panel of wood between the hallway and bathroom door. But most of all, it is needlessly hard to empty the bin, and nearly impossible to detangle all of the hair and fur from the bar or spinning brush beneath. There’s gross hair that will probably still be wrapped around the mechanism until the day I am put into the ground. This cursed thing will outlive us all, I fear.\n\nHow We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I tested these pet hair vacuums for a week if not more (I’ve been using both the Dyson cordless and handheld for months now), and I’ve used them on nearly every surface in my house—including the cat trees and behind my two cats’ litter box. When testing began, I lived in a large house with three cats and a dog (more hair in a larger area), and for the latter half of testing, I lived with two cats in a small apartment (slightly less hair in a smaller area with less places for hair to hide). I also tested every attachment on problem areas like carpeted stairs, crevices of air vents, a high-pile rug, and hardwood floors. Not all pet hair vacuums are created alike, and they vary quite a bit in their effectiveness on different surfaces and with different attachments. I set these up, charged ’em, and vacuumed with them until they died, noting run time, power, effectiveness, and ease of emptying the bin and cleaning the filter. What to Look For AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron It seems like a lot of brands will slap the words “pet hair” onto a product and market it as such without really specifying why or how it’s effective for pet hair. Of course, I tested those to see if they put their metaphorical vac mouths where their money was. On the flip side, I also tested some that were well rated for overall efficacy but not marketed toward pets—like the Roborock Saros 10R, a pricey robovac that uses AI mapping and can identify pets nearby and quiet its motor. Speaking of, vacuums and pets are inherently antithetical. Vacuums are a necessary evil to combat pet hair, but your pets will likely be scared of them. If my cat Basil had opposable thumbs, I know he’d be leaving hate comments on this article. Aside from the robovac picks (which for some reason my cats don’t mind), my cat Basil had a mild cardiac event each time I tested the other vacs on this list. So along with effectiveness and suction, I also took into consideration loudness, as well as how easy the product is to handle. Generally though, when shopping for a pet hair vacuum, look for suction power, bin capacity, attachments, and type of bristle or Motorbar—figure out what’s going to be doing the actual picking up of dust, dander, and pet hair. I found that conical bars like the ones on certain Dyson models work well to not get tangled, and dual brushes like on the Ryobi work together to effectively pick up more. Also read reviews from real people with real, furry pets, but know that no two pets are alike. Take into consideration what kind of shedder you live with, and what type of space needs cleaning; a robovac may not be best for a house with multiple flights of carpeted stairs.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

{"title": "The Worst Hacks of 2025", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/worst-hacks-of-2025/", "summary": "From university breaches to cyberattacks that shut down whole supply chains, these were the worst cybersecurity incidents of the year.", "content": "It was a strange year in cyberspace, as US president Donald Trump and his administration launched foreign policy initiatives and massive changes to the federal government that have had significant geopolitical ramifications. Through it all, the steady drumbeat kept pounding of data breaches, leaks, ransomware attacks, digital extortion cases, and state-sponsored attacks that have unfortunately become a backdrop of daily life.\n\nHere's WIRED's look back on this year's most significant breaches, hacking sprees, and digital attacks. Stay alert, and stay safe out there.\n\nSalesforce Integrations\n\nAttackers grabbed data from the sales management giant Salesforce in at least two breaches this year—but they didn't compromise Salesforce directly. Instead, the group breached third-party Salesforce contractor integrations, including those of Gainsight and Salesloft.\n\nGoogle's Threat Intelligence Group published about the spree in August, saying that some Google Workspace data had been compromised as part of the breach of the sales and marketing platform Salesloft Drift. Though the incident was not a direct hack of Google Workspace, it represented a rare instance in recent years of Alphabet customer data being exposed.\n\nOther impacted companies include Cloudflare, Docusign, Verizon, Workday, Cisco, LinkedIn, Bugcrowd, Proofpoint, GitLab, SonicWall, Adidas, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel. The credit bureau TransUnion also had a breach apparently tied to the situation that exposed the information of 4.4 million people, including names and Social Security numbers.\n\nThe spree was perpetrated by a group known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters—a potential amalgam of actors and tooling from the hacking and data theft groups Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters. Researchers note, though, that the group isn't actually a one-to-one evolution of the three namesakes. Regardless, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters have a data leak site where they've been previewing troves of stolen data from the campaign and conducting digital extortion attacks on victims.\n\nClop’s Oracle E-Business Hacking Spree\n\nThe ransomware group Clop is known for carrying out mass exploitation of vulnerabilities for data breaches and extortion attacks. Past rampages in recent years had huge numbers of victims at both private companies and government agencies. This year, the group did it again, exploiting a vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business internal management platform to steal data from numerous companies and organizations.\n\nAs part of the spree, Clop was able to steal employee data from multiple companies, including the personal information of executives, and used it to send emails and other threatening communications to senior employees as part of demands for millions of dollars in ransom to delete the data instead of publishing it.\n\nOracle scrambled to patch the vulnerability at the beginning of October, but Clop had already been exploiting it to steal data from hospitals and health care groups, media companies like The Washington Post, and universities like the University of Pennsylvania (see below).\n\nUniversity Breaches\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania publicly disclosed a data breach at the beginning of November that took place at the end of October, impacting personal data—some of it years or decades old—of students, alumni, and donors. The data also included internal university documents and some financial information. The incident was the result of a phishing attack; the hacker sent email blasts to students and alumni describing Penn as “woke” and saying that the school prioritizes “legacies, donors and unqualified affirmative action admits.” The Verge reported, though, that ultimately the hacker may have been financially motivated.\n\nHarvard said in a November statement that the systems of its Alumni Affairs and Development office had been breached via a “phone-based phishing attack.” The incident involved personal information of alumni, their partners, Harvard donors, parents of current and former students, some current students, and some faculty and staff. The data included email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, event attendance records, information about donations to the university and other fundraising details. Princeton University was hit with a similar attack that same month, although the scope of affected data seems more limited.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:22.410392"}
{"title": "The Best Body Pillow, Tested and Reviewed (2025)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-body-pillows/", "summary": "From the classic body pillow to unique shapes for optimal limb support, we tested a wide range of body pillows designed for side sleepers.", "content": "Compare Our Picks\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nOthers Tested\n\nPillow Cube Side Cube for $60: This isn’t technically a body pillow, but it's specifically designed for side sleepers (and I love it), so it’s included in this list. This cuboid pillow is designed for the side sleeper, and aims to help with headaches and back and shoulder pains through its unique shape and soft, yet structured, filling. It has a breathable, soft-and-stretchy quilted side case that's removable with a zipper, and the AeroPluff foam core is comfy, regulating temperature to keep you sleeping coolly. I can sleep only on my side, and one of the problems I regularly have is a sore neck from the gap between my shoulder and my head. This square, 90-degree-angled pillow perfectly fills that gap and sits at a manageable head pillow size of 24 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 5 inches deep. The breathable cover and soft density even helped with ear pressure.\n\nLeacho Snoogle for $60: Though out of stock at the moment, this versatile body pillow is marketed for pregnant people because of its versatility and belly, hip, and knee support. Due to its unique shape, it can be contorted into many figures. With a removable cover made of a polyester/cotton blend and a polyester filling, this pillow is a lot more breathable than similar large body pillows on the list. Because of its unique shape for many positions, the pillow isn’t overstuffed, and I found that the fill tended to sink to the lower foot portion of the pillow when sleeping on it. Overall, this pillow is breathable and extremely customizable in shape, although I would’ve preferred something with a little more filling.\n\nWhite Noise Memory Foam Body Pillow With Hypoallergenic Zippered Protector for $35: I absolutely love the fill of this 50 x 14-inch pillow—the shredded foam is the perfect mix of structure and softness. If it were wider, 20 or so inches rather than 14 inches, this pillow would be perfect. But because I’m a side-only sleeper, I like to hold the body pillow and wrap my arms and legs around it. Since it is so narrow, my knees knock together on the other side. I may be able to overlook the flaw of its narrowness because the pillow has a super-comfy fill, but I wouldn’t recommend it for bigger people with longer limbs. Temporarily unavailable.\n\nEli & Elm Memory Foam Body Pillow for $130: In my home, we call this one “the 7 pillow” because … well, take a guess. This long, L/7-shaped pillow is marketed as a pregnancy pillow, but it's great for anyone who sleeps on their side. The short section fits neatly under your head, while the long end can reach down to fit between your legs. It comes with its own custom pillow case, which is great, because it's not like you'll have a ton of spares in this shape in your linen closet. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nNot Recommended\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nAlwyn Home Butcher Fiber Plush Pillow for $52: This 90 x 19-inch pillow disappoints. It’s egregiously long, which could be helpful for people who are taller or those who like more all-around body support. However, it just doesn’t have enough stuffing to fill 90 inches. The batting inside feels like typical fluffy batting found in homemade pillows, but it bunches throughout the pillow in clumps, leaving gaps where no filling reaches. These gaps often happen where your limbs rest, thus defeating the purpose of having a body pillow for support. The pillow is only about 2 inches deep and didn’t seem to ever spring up after I took it out of the box. I had to shake and knead the fiber to help make it more uniform throughout the inside of the pillow, but it did little to help.\n\nWhat to Look For AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron As a side sleeper, you’ll want a pillow that’s long enough to provide support between your arms and pressure points like between the knees. While firmness and softness are a matter of personal preference, you often want a body pillow that strikes the right balance, to provide support without being too heavy or firm for the limbs that rest underneath the pillow. If you’re just looking for a pillow to hug while you sleep, something lighter and softer is best. But if you have joint or spinal pain, something a bit more firm with more support is best. You’ll also want to think about which pillow shape will support which part of your body best, depending on your needs. I’m a strict side sleeper, but I toss and turn between both sides, so pillows with support on either side were tested too. I also tend to curl into a more fetal position, so I wanted something that had enough width to fully wrap my legs and arms around. While many head pillows and mattresses favor memory foam, depending on the foam's denseness, it can feel too heavy for a side sleeper whose limbs go underneath the pillow. Polyester or other synthetic filling is often the most plush and malleable but may not provide enough support. Many have a mixture of both or shredded memory foam, which can provide structure while still being soft enough to sink into. This depends on personal preference and need, but fill type is something to be aware of when looking for the perfect side-sleeper body pillow. A standard body pillow that's long enough to provide full-length support for the body is ideal, giving enough room to stretch out or cuddle in various positions. Body pillows in U or C shapes can provide more overall support and are ideal for pregnant people or those with back or leg issues, but can often make the sleeper run hot because of all of the surrounding material. But ultimately, the preferred shape is largely dependent on what parts of the body you want most supported in the side-sleeping position. How I Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I tested (slept with) each of the pillows for at least a week while sleeping, lounging, and sitting to see how the fill changed and moved over time.

Technically.\n\n“Died,” because Microsoft’s formal end-of-support date came and went on October 14, as the company had been saying for years. “Technically,” because it’s trivial for home users to get another free year of security updates with a few minutes of effort, and schools and businesses can get an additional two years of updates on top of that, and because load-bearing system apps like Edge and Windows Defender will keep getting updates through at least 2028 regardless.\n\nBut 2025 was undoubtedly a tipping point for the so-called “last version of Windows.” StatCounter data says Windows 11 has overtaken Windows 10 as the most-used version of Windows both in the US (February 2025) and worldwide (July 2025). Its market share slid from just over 44 percent to just under 31 percent in the Steam Hardware Survey. And now that Microsoft’s support for the OS has formally ended, games, apps, and drivers are already beginning the gradual process of ending or scaling back official Windows 10 support.\n\nWindows 10 is generally thought of as one of the “good” versions of Windows, and it was extremely popular in its heyday: the most widely used version of Windows since XP. That’s true even though many of the annoying things that people complain about in Windows 11 started during the Windows 10 era. Now that it’s time to write Windows 10’s epitaph, it’s worth examining what Microsoft got right with Windows 10, how it laid the groundwork for many of the things people dislike about Windows 11, and how Microsoft has made all of those problems worse in the years since Windows 11 first launched.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:00:01 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:23.453082"}

In an effort to save space for other components, device makers are finally dropping the SIM slot, and Google is the latest to move to embedded SIMs with the Pixel 10 series. After long avoiding eSIM, I had no choice but to take the plunge when the time came to review Google’s new phones. And boy, do I regret it.\n\nThe journey to eSIM\n\nSIM cards have existed in some form since the ’90s. Back then, they were credit card-sized chunks of plastic that occupied a lot of space inside the clunky phones of the era. They slimmed down over time, going through the miniSIM, microSIM, and finally nanoSIM eras. A modern nanoSIM is about the size of your pinky nail, but space is at a premium inside smartphones. Enter, eSIM.\n\nThe eSIM standard was introduced in 2016, slowly gaining support as a secondary option in smartphones. Rather than holding your phone number on a removable card, an eSIM is a programmable, non-removable component soldered to the circuit board. This allows you to store multiple SIMs and swap between them in software, and no one can swipe your SIM card from the phone. They also take up half as much space compared to a removable card, which is why OEMs have begun dropping the physical slot.\n\nApple was the first major smartphone maker to force the use of eSIM with the release of the iPhone 14, and it makes use of that space. The international iPhone 17 with a SIM card slot has a smaller battery than the eSIM-only version, but the difference is only about 8 percent. Google didn’t make the jump until this year with the Pixel 10 series—the US models are eSIM-only, but they unfortunately don’t have more of anything compared to the international versions.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:45:50 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:23.667398"}

Back in February, Trump warned Americans to expect “a little pain” after he issued executive orders imposing 10–25 percent tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including Canada, China, and Mexico. Immediately, industry associations sounded the alarm, warning that the costs of consumer tech could increase significantly. By April, Trump had ordered tariffs on all US trade partners to correct claimed trade deficits, using odd math that critics suspected came from a chatbot. (Those tariffs bizarrely targeted uninhabited islands that exported nothing and were populated by penguins.)\n\nCosts of tariffs only got higher as the year wore on. But the tech industry has done very little to push back against them. Instead, some of the biggest companies made their own surprising moves after Trump’s trade war put them in deeply uncomfortable positions.\n\nApple gives Trump a gold statue instead of US-made iPhone\n\nRight from the jump in February, Apple got backed into a corner after Trump threatened a “flat” 60 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, which experts said could have substantially taxed Apple’s business. Moving to appease Trump, Apple promised to invest $500 billion in the US in hopes of avoiding tariffs, but that didn’t take the pressure off for long.\n\nBy April, Apple stood by and said nothing as Trump promised the company would make “made in the USA” iPhones. Analysts suggested such a goal was “impossible,” calling the idea “impossible at worst and highly expensive at best.”\n\nApple’s silence did not spare the company Trump’s scrutiny. The next month, Trump threatened Apple with a 25 percent tariff on any iPhones sold in the US that were not manufactured in America. Experts were baffled by the threat, which appeared to be the first time a US company was threatened directly with tariffs.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:00:29 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:03:23.934619"}

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\n\nWith all the drama surrounding Warner Bros. Discovery’s plans to sell itself to another company, it’s not currently clear how much longer HBO Max will continue to exist in its current form. But for the time being, the streamer is chock full of solid series you might want to consider watching if you find yourself bored, chilly, and firmly planted on your couch this holiday season. Whether it’s superhero madness, dark satire, or steamy romance, HBO Max has a little bit of everything. And the streamer has a whole lot more coming down the pipeline, so now’s the time to check out some of what it had to offer in 2025.\n\nHeated Rivalry\n\nAt a time when it often feels like TV is shying away from sex in favor of more family friendly stories that appeal to Gen Z’s modest tastes, Heated Rivalry — an adaptation of Rachel Reid’s Game Changers novels — feels like a breath of fresh (and steamy) air. It’s a classic frenemies-to-forbidden lovers romance set against the backdrop of professional ice hockey. But as spicy as the series is, it’s also a strong drama anchored by two stellar lead performances from Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie. Canadian streamer Crave (the original studio behind Heated Rivalry) has already greenlit a second season, and if the show strikes your fancy, you should check out the books as well.\n\nI Love LA\n\nDespite its name, Rachell Sennot’s I Love LA is really a love letter to one’s late 20s — that magical time when you understand that life isn’t all sunshine and daisies, but you still have the energy to say “screw it” and go out partying with your friends. The show’s feelings about Los Angeles as a showbiz industry town are much thornier, and its sense of humor is charged with a deliciously pointed nihilism.\n\nThe Pitt\n\nIn its first season, The Pitt reminded everyone what makes tightly-crafted procedural dramas with hefty episode counts so satisfying to watch. Even though the show’s story took place over the course of a single day, The Pitt felt so much bigger because of how much time it spent developing its characters and making them feel like people with lives outside of the emergency room. Season 2 is right around the corner, but there’s still time to get all caught up. You should probably dig in soon, though, because The Pitt is a show best savored rather than binged.\n\nAdventure Time: Fionna and Cake\n\nAdventure Time: Fiona and Cake’s second season digs deeper into its whimsical multiverse as heroines Fionna (Madeleine Martin) and Cake the Cat (Roz Ryan) set out to save Finn the Human’s (Jeremy Shada) life after he’s wounded in battle. Though the second season moves a bit slower than the first, the way it deepens the backstories of some of Adventure Time’s supporting characters like Huntress Wizard (Ashly Burch) and Simon (Tom Kenny) is phenomenal.\n\nIt: Welcome to Derry\n\nThere was so much detail from Stephen King’s It novel that didn’t make it into Warner Bros.’ recent film adaptations, and one of the (few) great things about HBO’s Welcome to Derry prequel series is how it manages to weave a lot of that lore into a wholly original story. There’s only so much mystery and suspense because this is a story about murderous horror from beyond the stars who we all know will live to see another day. But it’s interesting to see how Pennywise’s tactics have evolved over time, and if the finale’s any indication, we’re going to be seeing much more of the clown’s story unfolding in other points in time.\n\nHarley Quinn\n\nHarley (Kaley Cuoco) and Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) have had their ups and downs. But after a few seasons of figuring their romantic situation out, the couple are together, stronger than ever, and shaking their lives up a bit by leaving Gotham city behind in favor of moving to Metropolis. The Harley Quinn series has always excelled at lampooning the denizens of Batman’s home city, but the show’s fifth season takes things to the next level by taking aim at a bigger larger chunk of DC’s universe of heroes and villains.\n\nMad Men\n\nThough Mad Men is almost 20-years-old at this point, it is new to HBO Max and the streamer has finally worked out most of those embarrassing technical issues that made the series’ 4K streaming debut such a fiasco. Mad Men’s approach to storytelling has always been excellent, but it’s especially wild in 2025 to see how the show’s characters evolve over the course of a seven season run. The series is an all-time classic that embodies everything that was great about the last pre-streaming golden age of TV. And if you haven’t had a chance to see Mad Men in its entirety, now is the perfect time to dive back in.\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nMike White’s madcap dark comedy lampooning the wealthy travels to Thailand in its third season to weave another tale about people who can’t escape their inner demons. It takes a little bit longer for this season to really get rolling and deliver on The White Lotus’ promise of bonkers twists. But if you can stick it out, the season (mostly) delivers and makes for a solid watch before the show returns before its next chapter.\n\nThe Last of Us\n\nAs was the case with The Last of Us Part II, the second season of HBO’s The Last of Us series goes through some major changes that takes its story in a very different direction. Bella Ramsey’s Ellie has always been a tremendous on-screen presence, but there’s a dynamism to her performance in season 2 that is nothing short of amazing. The show’s production design, cinematography, and special effects make it feel like one of HBO’s strongest projects in ages. And because we’re still a ways out from season 3 premiering, your best bet for now is to fire the show up from the very beginning.\n\nPeacemaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6AZTfI54OU\n\nThe latest season of James Gunn’s Peacemaker snatched everyone’s wigs with a wild twist that makes a hell of a lot more sense when you watch the episodes for a second time. Multiversal superhero fare has long since grown a bit tiresome, but Peacemaker uses the comics convention to tell a surprisingly thoughtful and poignant story about its titular meathead. Though John Cena will likely reprise the role in future DC Studios projects, it seems like this might be the end of Peacemaker’s standalone series. But as superhero spinoff projects go, Peacemaker was a success that’s more than worth your time this holiday season.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-29T08:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:50:43.326693"}

It drops the extra rear display that’s the key selling point of the 17 Pro, but instead adds in the option of a manual zoom ring, built directly into the phone’s camera island.\n\nThat rotating zoom is only included in the new Leica edition of the phone, which also packs touches like the Leica red dot logo and a textured finish on the phone’s sides. The ring can be reprogrammed for exposure or focus if you prefer, and the Leica version has a few custom software touches too, like unique film simulation effects, and physical accessories like a lens cap and branded cleaning cloth.\n\nOtherwise, the 17 Ultra by Leica is identical to the regular 17 Ultra. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, with up to 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM.

Image: Xiaomi\n\nLike all Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, its cameras are the real focus. The 50-megapixel main camera uses a 1-inch-type sensor and a wide f/1.7 aperture, with selfie and ultrawide cameras at the same resolution.\n\nThe bigger change is to the telephoto — instead of the two separate zoom lenses on the 15 Ultra, the new phone has a single 200-megapixel periscope camera that can range from 3.2x to 4.3x zoom. More impressively, it has continuous optical zoom throughout, a trick first employed in phones by the Sony Xperia 1 IV, with a variable aperture of f/2.4-3.0.\n\nThe 17 Ultra starts at ¥6,999 (about $1,000), with the Leica model at ¥7,999 (about $1,140). Xiaomi has confirmed plans for a global launch of the 17 Ultra in 2026, but we don’t know when exactly — or whether the Leica edition will be included.

Being an arcade cabinet from the 1980s. OK, it’s probably a highly specific market lamenting that one oversight, but if you find yourself in that niche, then UK-based peripheral maker iMP Tech might have just the thing for you.\n\nThe Mini Arcade Pro is an arcade cabinet shell compatible with the original Switch, the Switch OLED, and the Switch 2. It’s built around an eight-button base unit with a retro-style eight-way joystick, emulating the look and feel of classic rigs, with your console slotting in to serve as the screen. It also packs in a few touches you wouldn’t find in the arcade, like a mappable Turbo feature.\n\nGiven the Switch is home to a host of classic arcade-style games—thanks to titles included in the Nintendo Switch Online libraries for NES, SNES, and Genesis/Mega Drive, and through various retro releases such as Namco Museum over the years—this should make for a gadget perfect for delivering some (slightly gimmicky) throwback fun. Sadly, it’s marred by production and design issues, making it hard to recommend.\n\nPhotograph: Matt Kamen\n\nBuilding Simulator\n\nThe Mini Arcade Pro comes flat-packed in seven pieces, though you’ll only use six to put it together—there’s a tray each for the original Switch models and the Switch 2. Each of those is hinged, allowing you to insert the core tablet of either console, and then seals magnetically to hold it safely in place. It's all fairly intuitive to snap together. A rear panel adds stability and 12 storage slots for Switch game cards, and then the console tray slides into place, docking onto a male USB connector. A marquee strip then snaps onto the top, holding everything together. The arcade base draws power from the console, but a through-port underneath allows you to plug a USB-C charger.\n\nThe unit pairs with the console as a controller, which involves a little bit of menu diving and telling your Switch to regard it as a Pro Controller in wired communication mode. If you usually use a Pro Controller wirelessly, you’ll need to swap this setting each time. For anyone using a Switch 2, the cabinet can use the console’s wake function and has a C button to activate GameChat—connecting a camera might be a bit tricky given the setup, but the Switch 2’s built-in microphone suffices for voice chat.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T13:50:43.742033"}

Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment.\n\nBut enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An MIT survey in August found that 95% of enterprises weren’t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI.\n\nSo when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, and increase their budgets for the tech.\n\nEnterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now.

Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn’t mean they should. We’ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty.\n\nMolly Alter, partner, Northzone: A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers.

Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We’ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence.\n\nAlexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital: 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world — especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures.\n\nLonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: We’re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn’t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect.\n\nTom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean: If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it’s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don’t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold.\n\nWhich areas are you looking to invest in?\n\nEmily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures: We are targeting two distinct frontiers: AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research.\n\nMichael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Future datacenter technology. For the last year or so, we’ve been standing up a few new investments that signal our interest in future “token factory” technology, with an eye towards what can really advance how efficiently and cleanly they run. This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between sites.\n\nJonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Vertical enterprise software where proprietary workflows and data create defensibility, particularly in regulated industries, supply chain, retail, and other complex operational environments.\n\nAaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: We are at the limit of humanity’s ability to generate enough energy to feed power-hungry GPUs. As an investor, I’m looking for software and hardware that can drive breakthroughs in performance per watt. This could be better GPU management, more efficient AI chips, next-gen networking approaches like optical, or rethinking thermal load within AI systems and datacenters.\n\nWhen it comes to AI startups, how do you determine that a company has a moat?\n\nRob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: A moat in AI is less about the model itself and more about economics and integration. We look for companies that are deeply embedded in enterprise workflows, have access to proprietary or continuously improving data, and demonstrate defensibility through switching costs, cost advantages, or outcomes that are difficult to replicate.\n\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: I’m skeptical of moats built purely on model performance or prompting — those advantages erode in months. The question I ask: if OpenAI or Anthropic launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?\n\nMolly Alter, partner, Northzone: It’s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category rather than a horizontal one. The best moats are data moats, where each incremental customer, data point, or interaction makes the product better. These are somewhat easier to build in specialized categories like manufacturing, construction, health or legal, where data is more consistent across customers. But there are also interesting “workflow moats,” where defensibility comes from understanding how a task or project moves from point A to point B in an industry.\n\nHarsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures: For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise’s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences. Enterprises already sit on incredibly rich data; what they lack is the ability to reason over it in a targeted, trustworthy way. We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer’s governed data, without creating new silos, to deliver insights or automation that weren’t previously possible.\n\nWill 2026 be the year when enterprises start to gain value from AI investments?\n\nKirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that random experiments with dozens of solutions create chaos. They will focus on fewer solutions with more thoughtful engagement.\n\nAntonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces. In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.\n\nScott Beechuk, partner, Norwest Venture Partners: We’re definitely getting closer. If last year was about laying the infrastructure for AI, 2026 is when we begin to see whether the application layer can turn that investment into real value. As specialized models mature and oversight improves, AI systems are becoming more reliable in daily workflows.\n\nMarell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Yes, but still incremental. There is still a lot of iteration, and AI is still improving to the point of being able to showcase pain-point solutions for enterprises across a variety of industries. I believe solving simulation to reality training will likely open up many opportunities for a selection of industries, both existing and nascent.\n\nJennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: There have been sensational headlines this year about enterprises not seeing returns on their AI investments. Ask any software engineer if they would ever want to go back to the dark ages before they had AI coding tools. Unlikely. My point is, enterprises are already gaining value this year, and it will multiply across organizations next year.\n\nDo you think enterprises will increase their AI budgets in 2026?\n\nRajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: Yes, I believe they will, though it’s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over.\n\nRob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results, and will decline sharply for everything else. Overall spend may grow, but it will be significantly more concentrated. We expect a bifurcation, where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.\n\nGordon Ritter, founder and general partner, Emergence Capital: Yes, but spend will concentrate. Enterprises will increase budgets where AI expands on institutional advantages, and pull back from tools that simply automate workflows without capturing (and securing!) proprietary intelligence.\n\nAndrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: 2026 will be the year that CIOs push back on AI vendor sprawl. Today, enterprises are testing out multiple tools for a single use case — monthly spend and switching costs are low in many cases, so the incentive to experiment is there — and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts]. As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools, and deploy those savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.\n\nRyan Isono, managing director, Maverick Ventures: In aggregate, yes, and there will be some shifting from pilots/experimental budgets to budgeted line items. A boon for AI startups in 2026 will be the transition of enterprises who tried to build in-house solutions and have now realized the difficulty and complexity required in production at scale.\n\nWhat does it take to raise a Series A as an enterprise-focused AI startup in 2026?\n\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The best companies right now combine two things: a compelling “why now” narrative — usually tied to GenAI creating new attack surfaces, infrastructure needs, or workflow opportunities — and concrete proof of enterprise adoption. $1 million to $2 million [annual recurring revenue] is the baseline, but what matters more than that is whether customers view you and your product as mission-critical to their business versus just being a nice-to-have. Revenue without narrative is a feature; narrative without traction is vaporware. You need both.\n\nLonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: You should aim to show you’re building in a space where the [total addressable market] expands rather than evaporates as AI drives down costs. Some markets have high elasticity of demand – a 90% price decline leads to a 10x increase in market size. Others have low elasticity, where dropping the price can vaporize the market, so the customers keep all of the value being created.\n\nJonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Customers are using the product in real, day-to-day operations, and are willing to take reference calls and talk honestly about impact, reliability, and buying process, etc. Companies should be able to clearly show how the product saves time, reduces cost or increases output in a way that holds up through security, legal, and procurement reviews.\n\nMichael Stewart, managing partner, M12: We (investors) were casting a doubtful eye towards [estimated annual recurring revenue] or pilot revenue until recently. Now, it’s not seen as much of an asterisk as much as the customer’s interest and willingness to evaluate a solution in the face of so many options pushed their way. Getting those engagements and customer buy-in in terms of running an evaluation isn’t just a matter of forward-deployed engineers making it easier for the customer. It takes quality and a winning marketing message to do it in 2026. Investors are expecting to see conversions become the leading part of the story after 6 months of pilot use.\n\nMarell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Execution and traction. The best signal is users genuinely delighted to use the product, and the technical sophistication of the business. We look at a huge North Star of real contractual agreements, 12+ months. In addition to that, was this founder able to attract top-tier talent to join their startup over competitors or the traditional hyper-scalers?\n\nWhat role will AI agents play at enterprises by the end of 2026?\n\nNnamdi Okike, managing partner and co-founder, 645 Ventures: Agents will still be in their initial adoption phase by the end of 2026. There are many technical and compliance hurdles that need to be overcome for enterprises to truly benefit from AI agents. There also need to be standards created for agent-to-agent communication.\n\nRajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: One universal agent will emerge. Today, each agent is siloed in its role – for example, inbound [sales development representative], outbound SDR, customer support, product discovery, etc. But by late next year, we’ll start to see these roles converge into a single agent with shared context and memory, breaking down long-standing organizational silos, and enabling a more unified, contextual conversation between companies and their users.\n\nAntonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The winners will be organizations that figure out the right balance of autonomy and oversight quickly, and that recognize agent deployment as collaborative augmentation rather than a clean division of labor. Rather than agents handling all routine work while humans do all the thinking, we’ll see more sophisticated collaboration between humans and agents on complex tasks, with the boundary between their roles continuously evolving.\n\nAaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: The majority of knowledge workers will have at least one agentic co-worker they know by name!\n\nEric Bahn, co-founder, general partner, Hustle Fund: I think that AI agents will probably be the bigger part of the workforce than any humans in enterprises. Proliferating AI agents is essentially free and zero marginal cost. So why not grow through bots?\n\nWhat kinds of companies in your portfolio are seeing the strongest growth?\n\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The companies growing fastest are the ones that identified a workflow or security gap created by GenAI adoption, then executed relentlessly on product-market fit. In cybersecurity, it’s tools addressing data security so LLMs can interact with sensitive data safely, and agent governance ensuring autonomous systems have appropriate controls. In marketing, it’s new areas like Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — getting discovered in AI responses, not just search results. The common thread: these weren’t categories two years ago, but are now must-haves for enterprises deploying AI at scale.\n\nAndrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: We’re seeing growth tied to a few common themes. One is companies that land with focused use cases — companies that start with a narrower wedge (could be a focused target persona or use case), really nail it, become sticky and earn the right to expand from the initial wedge.\n\nJennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: Companies that help enterprises put AI into production are doing well. Areas like data extraction and structuring, developer productivity for AI systems, infrastructure for generative media, voice and audio for media and apps like support or call centers.\n\nWhat kinds of companies are seeing the strongest retention?\n\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: Companies with retention and expansion share a pattern: they solve problems that intensify as customers deploy more AI. Strong retention comes from three things: being mission-critical (removal breaks production workflows), accumulating proprietary context that’s hard to recreate, and solving problems that grow with AI adoption rather than being one-and-done.\n\nTom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean: Retention is trickier to measure for younger companies, but the highest retention we’re seeing is in the serious enterprise software providers, especially those enhanced with AI. A good example is Operations1, which digitizes employee-led production processes end-to-end. These companies go deep into the customer’s organization, transform how they operate, and build up proprietary data and knowledge that makes them very hard to do without.\n\nMichael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Startups serving the enterprise in data tooling and vertical AI apps, with forward-deployed teams assisting in customer satisfaction, quality, and product improvement. This seems to be the winning formula that has been adopted by all leading startups in those markets. Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices.\n\nJonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Retention is highest where software becomes foundational infrastructure rather than a point solution. Authzed has strong retention because authorization and policy sit at the core of modern systems, and are extremely costly to rip out once embedded. Courier Health and GovWell act as systems of record and orchestration layers for end-to-end workflows, patient journeys in healthcare, and permitting in government, which makes them deeply embedded once live.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T14:27:47.003601"}

That could be a thing of the past, though, thanks to a breakthrough lens technology developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that can bring every part of a scene into sharp focus, capturing finer details across the entire image, no matter the distance.\n\nTraditional lenses are limited to sharpening one focal plane (the distance between an object and your camera) at a time, blurring everything behind or in front of that object. That effect can bring a sense of depth to images, but seeing a full picture clearly typically requires you to combine multiple photographs that were shot at different focal lengths. This new “spatially-varying autofocus” system instead combines a mix of technologies that “let the camera decide which parts of the image should be sharp — essentially giving each pixel its own tiny, adjustable lens,” according to CMU associate professor Matthew O’Tool.\n\nThe researchers developed a “computational lens” that combines a Lohmann lens — two curved, cubic lenses that shift against each other to tune focus — with a phase-only spatial light modulator — a device that controls how light bends at each pixel — allowing the system to focus at different depths simultaneously. It also uses two autofocus methods: Contrast-Detection Autofocus (CDAF), which divides images into regions that independently maximize sharpness, and Phase-Detection Autofocus (PDAF), which detects whether something is in focus and which focal direction to adjust.\n\nLeft: a conventional photo with a regular lens, where objects at a single focal plane appear sharp. Right: An all-in-focus photo captured through spatially-varying autofocusing. Image: Yingsi Qin, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, Matthew O’Toole |Carnegie Mellon University\n\nThe experimental system “could fundamentally change how cameras see the world,” according to CMU professor Aswin Sankaranarayanan.\n\nIt isn’t available in any commercial camera you can actually buy, and it may be some time before options start appearing on the market, if ever. CMU researchers suggest that this tech could have broader applications beyond traditional photography, however, including improved efficiency in microscopes, creating lifelike depth perception for VR headsets, and helping autonomous vehicles to see their surroundings with “unprecedented clarity.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-29T09:50:20-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T15:29:48.651942"}

The cloud deck was low, and so was visibility. In such gray situations, pilots use GPS technology to help them land on a runway and not the side of a mountain.\n\nBut on this day, GPS systems weren’t working correctly, the airwaves jammed with signals that prevented airplanes from accessing navigation information. The Widerøe flight had taken off during one of Russia’s frequent wargames, in which the country’s military simulates conflict as a preparation exercise. This one involved an imaginary war with a country. It was nicknamed Zapad-2025—translating to “West-2025”—and was happening just across the fjord from Vardø. According to European officials, GPS interference was frequent in the runup to the exercise. Russian forces, they suspected, were using GPS-signal-smashing technology, a tactic used in non-pretend conflict, too. (Russia has denied some allegations of GPS interference in the past.)\n\nWithout that guidance from space, and with the cloudy weather, the Widerøe plane had to abort its landing and continue down the coast away from Russia, to Båtsfjord, a fishing village.\n\nThe part of Norway in which this interruption occurred is called Finnmark. GPS disruption there is near-constant; problems linked to Russian interference have increased since the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMilitary and Pokemon players?\n\nIt’s one of the starkest geographic examples of how vulnerable GPS technology is.

In ancient cultures that predated science, such events were often memorialized in myths and legends. There is a growing body of research that strives to connect those ancient stories with the real natural events that inspired them. Folklorist and historian Adrienne Mayor has put together a fascinating short compendium of such insights with Mythopedia: A Brief Compendium of Natural History Lore, from dry quicksand and rains of frogs to burning lakes, paleoburrows, and Scandinavian “endless winters.”\n\nMayor’s work has long straddled multiple disciplines, but one of her specialities is best described as geomythology, a term coined in 1968 by Indiana University geologist Dorothy Vitaliano, who was interested in classical legends about Atlantis and other civilizations that were lost due to natural disasters. Her interest resulted in Vitaliano’s 1973 book Legends of the Earth: Their Geologic Origins.\n\nMayor herself became interested in the field when she came across Greek and Roman descriptions of fossils, and that interest expanded over the years to incorporate other examples of “folk science” in cultures around the world. Her books include The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates, Rome’s Deadliest Enemy (2009), as well as Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, & the Scorpion Bombs (2022), exploring the origins of biological and chemical warfare. Her 2018 book, Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology, explored ancient myths and folklore about creating automation, artificial life, and AI, connecting them to the robots and other ingenious mechanical devices actually designed and built during that era.\n\nWhen her editor at Princeton University Press approached her about writing a book on geomythology, she opted for an encyclopedia format, which fit perfectly into an existing Princeton series of little encyclopedias about nature. “In this case, I wasn’t going to be working with just Greek and Roman antiquity,” Mayor told Ars. “I had collected very rich files on geomyths around the world. There are even a few modern geomyths in there. You can dip into whatever you’re interested in and skip the rest.

Algorithmic recommendations play an integral role in how users discover new content across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. It can be nice to be fed a stream of fresh posts, pictures, and videos that are already tailored to our interests instead of manually hunting for content to engage with, but algorithms don’t always show you what you actually want to see.\n\nMany online platforms provide features that aim to help you fix this. The algorithms they deploy are, after all, designed to make you spend more time consuming content and work in similar ways. Recommendations may be based on demographic data like age, sex, and location, your online activity, what you and similar users are interacting with, and more. Most algorithm tuning features follow the same basic premise: you tell the platform what you want to see more of, or less of.\n\nFor example, Meta’s in-development “Dear algo” feature for Threads takes that premise quite literally, allowing users to ask for “more” of specific type of content. Meanwhile, the recently launched “Your Algorithm” tool for Instagram lets users see and manage which topics are driving their Reels recommendations. Some content on online platforms may be artificially promoted regardless of whether it aligns with user interests, however. This article breaks down what algorithm tuning tools are provided by some of the most popular online platforms, and other solutions that can help you to — at least partially — reign in recommended content.\n\nFacebook:\n\nThe “Interested” and “Not interested” options will also be identified with Plus and Minus icons respectively. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nThe posts that appear on your Facebook feed are a mix of recommended content and whatever is being published by friends and pages you follow. For the latter, you can just leave any page groups you’re no longer interested in and unfriend users to stop seeing their posts.\n\nAn easy way to do this is to go to Settings & privacy > Content preferences, and then open the “Unfollow people and groups” option to quickly manage your friends and group lists in one place. The Content preferences menu also lets you toggle off suggestions for political content and provides a “Show less” option for sensitive or graphic content.\n\nThere are other controls available under Settings & privacy > Settings > Your activity > Activity log that list other interactions you’ve had on the platform: comments, search history, videos watched, and more. Deleting these interaction histories (either individually or by clearing them entirely) may help to prevent Facebook’s algorithm from suggesting similar content in the future.\n\nFor specific posts, you can click into the three-dot menu at the top right of the post itself and select either “Interested” to see more of similar content, or “Not interested” to prompt Facebook into showing you less related content. Meta said it’s planning to “introduce new ways for you to shape your Feed” on Facebook in the coming months, including the ability to give feedback on why something in your feed may not be relevant to you.\n\nInstagram:\n\nThis AI-generated summarization of your interests is currently only applicable to Instagram’s Reels feature. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nFor Reels specifically, Meta has a tool that allows you to manage which topics Instagram is using to feed recommended videos to your Reels tab. On the Instagram mobile app, you can tap the icon that resembles two hearts on line sliders at the top-right corner of Reels videos to see an AI-generated summary of topics that are based on your activity history, such as gaming, haircare, college football, or whatever else you’ve interacted with.\n\nTapping on any of these interests gives you the options to watch Reels on that topic, delete it from your interests, or specify to see less of it on your feed. You can also manually add new interests that you want to see more or less of that aren’t included in the AI summary. The Instagram app will also let you tap the three-dot menu on individual Reels to select “Interested” or “Not Interested,” but this feature isn’t available on the desktop Reels tab.\n\nThe main Instagram feed presents those Interested / Not Interested options on both mobile and desktop devices. And like Facebook, Instagram users can click into Settings to manage preferences for sensitive and political content and curate their activity history across likes, comments, reposts, tags, and more to remove anything that might be flagging certain interests to Instagram’s algorithm.\n\nThreads:\n\nDear Algo lets you adjust your Threads algorithm by describing in your own words what you want to see more or less of. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nThreads allows you to tap on the three-dot menu on any post on the web and mobile app, and select “Not interested” to see less content around that topic. Unlike Facebook and Instagram, however, Threads won’t let you specify posts you want to see more of. There are also fewer options to manage recommended content if you head into the account settings on desktop devices — you can restrict profiles to see fewer posts from them, block profiles entirely, and mute specific words or phrases to prevent posts that contain them from appearing in your feeds.\n\nThe Threads mobile app will provide additional options under the settings menu at the top right of your user profile. From there, you can remove any likes you’ve left on posts, or select “Content preferences” to toggle suggestions for political and sensitive content, alongside muting accounts and filtering words.\n\nThreads is also testing a feature called “Dear algo requests” that can be accessed under this menu, or by typing “Dear algo” in a post, and then describing what you want to see more or less often in your feeds for up to three days. I’m seeing this feature available on my own account in the UK, but the beta may not be available to every user yet.\n\nX:\n\nX will suggests topics for you to follow based on how you’ve interacted with the platform, but you can also manually add your own. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nThere are two ways to tune your algorithm on X, and they can both be accessed the same way across web and mobile apps. The first is to tap the three-dot menu at the top right of a post on your “For You” feed, and select “Not interested in this post” to see less of any similar content. Note that this option won’t appear if you open the post itself, so make sure you’re accessing the menu from the feed timeline.\n\nThe second and more comprehensive option is to open Settings and privacy > Privacy and safety > Content you see. This view will let you toggle to display media containing sensitive content and see a full list of interests that X is using to “personalize your experience” across the platform. These will all feature a ticked checkbox, so just go through and untick anything you’re not actually interested in seeing, though X says that changes “may take a little while to go into effect.”\n\nThe “Content you see” menu also lets you mute accounts and keywords to keep them out of your feeds and manage topics you want to follow or see less of. Following topics will prompt X to show you more related content, while the topics on posts you’ve already flagged to see less of will appear under the “Not interested” tab.\n\nTikTok:\n\nTikTok provides a list of generic topics that you can manage with a slider control, sliding left to see less, and right to see more. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nTikTok provides similar algorithm tuning tools to X, including the ability to flag specific videos you’re not interested in. You can access this on the TikTok mobile app by long-pressing on the video or by opening the three-dot menu at the top right of videos on the desktop web platform. Web users can also open the settings menu to filter specific keywords, preventing posts that contain them in titles, descriptions, or stickers from appearing in your feeds.\n\nAdditional features can only be accessed on the TikTok mobile apps. On your user profile, open the three-line menu at the top right and select Settings and privacy > Content preferences. You can open the Manage topics option to see a list of preset interests like Dance, Humor, Sports, Food & Drink, and more, each with a slider to adjust if you want to see more or less of that topic on your feed. Content preferences also allow you to enable a “Restricted Mode” that limits content that “may not be comfortable for all audiences.”\n\nFor more drastic changes, TikTok has a feature that helps to retrain its algorithm to what video topics you enjoy watching. Selecting “Refresh your For You feed” under Content preferences will “temporarily show you popular videos you may not normally see,” according to TikTok, allowing it to learn what you like from scratch based on videos you like, share, and interact with.\n\nYouTube:\n\nYou’ll need to be on the YouTube homescreen to see both the “Not interested” and “Don’t recommend channel” options. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nYouTube’s algorithm tuning tools may require some patience because the platform doesn’t provide an overview of topics or interests you’re being targeted with. On the YouTube homepage, you can open the three-dot menu at the bottom right under each video on the web or mobile app and then select “Not interested” to see less of similar content, or “Don’t recommend channel” to keep the creator who posted it out of your feeds.\n\nThe same feature works slightly differently for Shorts — the “Not interested” and “Don’t recommend channel” options are both available on the YouTube mobile app’s Shorts tab and can be accessed by either long-pressing on a video or opening the three-dot menu at the top right. The Shorts tab on YouTube’s web platform only provides you with the option to block channel recommendations, however, and only allows you to tag Shorts you’re not interested in if those Shorts appear on YouTube’s homepage.\n\nIf you want to hide recommended videos entirely, you can delete and turn off your YouTube watch history on your connected Google account by going to My Activity > YouTube History.\n\nReddit:\n\nLike YouTube, you’ll only see the option to show fewer posts on Reddit’s suggested content if you’re on the Reddit home feed, and not if you’ve opened the post itself. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nThere are a few ways to adjust what content will appear on your Reddit home feed. As we’ve seen with other platforms, you can open the three-dot menu at the top right of suggested posts and select “Show fewer posts like this.” You can also click on your user profile and open Settings > Preferences on the web, or Settings > Account settings on the Reddit mobile app to mute specific subreddit communities, filter out mature content, or toggle home feed recommendations off entirely.\n\nIf you keep it active, then Reddit will recommend posts based on your activity on the platform, including your search history and posts or communities you’ve interacted with.\n\nBluesky:\n\nBluesky gives you the freedom to ditch its preset Discover feed entirely. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nIt’s easy to direct what content you want to see in the preset Discover feed on Bluesky. Just open the three-dot menu at the bottom right on any post and — you guessed it — select if you want to see more or less of similar content. Alternatively, you can unpin the Discover feed entirely and replace it with a more curated feed that focuses on topics you’re interested in by selecting one of the options under the My feeds tab, identified by its hashtag symbol.\n\nTumblr:\n\nStill using Tumblr? It has fewer algorithm tweaking options compared to other social platforms. Image by The Verge | Jess Weatherbed\n\nLike other platforms, the algorithm on Tumblr’s “For you” tab is largely prompted by how you interact with the platform itself and what’s popular with similar users in your communities. If you like art and follow a lot of artists, Tumblr will recommend art-related posts, and so forth.\n\nFor posts that aren’t from users or communities you follow, you can open the three-dot menu to tag that you’re not interested in the post itself, or the community it was shared in. You can also open Settings > Dashboard preferences to turn off suggestions that are “based on your likes” and posts from your communities in the following tab.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-29T11:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T16:33:15.004167"}

For instance, with a Spotify integration, you can tell it to create personalized playlists that will show up right in your Spotify app.\n\nTo get started, make sure you’re logged into ChatGPT. Then type the name of the app you want to use at the start of your prompt, and ChatGPT will guide you through signing in and connecting your account.\n\nIf you want to set everything up at once, head over to the Settings menu, then click on Apps and Connectors. You can browse through the available apps, pick the ones you like, and it’ll take you to the sign-in page for each one.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that connecting your account means you’re sharing your app data with ChatGPT. Make sure to review the permissions you’re giving when you’re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information. (Sharing this info helps personalize the experience, but if you have privacy concerns, consider whether you’re comfortable with this level of access before connecting.)\n\nYou can also disconnect any app whenever you want, right from the Settings menu.\n\nAvailable apps\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis integration with the online travel giant is designed to help travelers, especially first-time visitors in need of suggestions for where to stay.\n\nOnce you link your Booking.com account, you can ask ChatGPT to find hotels in your preferred city based on your dates and budget. You can also specify how many people are coming and whether you want the hotel near public transport. ChatGPT aims to make this process more intuitive than searching directly on the Booking.com site. Plus, you can be more specific, like searching for options “with breakfast included.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nWhen you find a hotel you like, just open the Booking.com listing to complete your reservation.\n\nCanva\n\nImage Credits:Canva\n\nCanva in ChatGPT is a helpful tool for graphic designers and anyone else who needs to generate visual content quickly. Whether it’s for a social media post, a poster, or a slide deck for a presentation, this may be a good way to help kickstart your project and brainstorm ideas.\n\nOnce you connect your Canva account, you can ask ChatGPT to design something like “a 16:9 slide deck about our Q4 roadmap” or “a fun poster for a dog-walking business.” You can include specifics such as the fonts you prefer, color schemes, formats (like Instagram posts or stories), and exact dimensions.\n\nAI-generated designs are seldom perfect, with occasional distorted images or spelling mistakes. However, some users may find this better than starting from scratch, and they can jump into Canva at any time to tweak their design and make it look just how they want.\n\nCoursera\n\nImage Credits:Coursera\n\nCoursera’s integration is designed to help you quickly discover the best online courses for your skill level. For instance, you can then tell ChatGPT to find an “intermediate-level course on Python.” You can then tell the chatbot to compare course options by rating, duration, and cost before enrolling. ChatGPT can also provide a quick rundown of what exactly each course covers.\n\nDoorDash\n\nImage Credits:DoorDash\n\nDoorDash’s newly launched ChatGPT integration aims to save time on meal planning and grocery shopping. Users can ask the chatbot for a meal plan and instantly add all ingredients to their DoorDash cart, then review and check out.\n\n​Currently, this feature is available only to users in the U.S., with participating grocery retailers including Kroger, Safeway, Fairway Markets, Wegmans, and more.\n\nExpedia\n\nImage Credits:Expedia\n\nChatGPT can display hotel options and flights via Expedia without leaving chat. Whether you’re looking for a quick escape or a longer trip, it can find flights that fit your travel dates, budget, and number of travelers. You can narrow things down by saying stuff like “Only show 4-star hotels.” Once you see something you like, go to Expedia to finalize everything and book your trip.\n\nFigma\n\nImage Credits:Figma\n\nTo use Figma in ChatGPT, you can ask it to generate diagrams, flow charts, and more. This is helpful for turning your ideas and brainstorming sessions into something more tangible. It may also be useful for visualizing complex concepts or workflows.\n\nYou can also upload files and ask the chatbot to generate a product roadmap for your team. This roadmap can include milestones, deliverables, and deadlines, helping your team stay organized and focused on their goals.\n\nSpotify\n\nImage Credits:Spotify\n\nOne of the most helpful aspects of using Spotify in ChatGPT is the ability to quickly create playlists and listen to new recommended songs tailored to your specific tastes. You can ask it to create a playlist based on your current mood, or just a playlist that only includes tracks by your favorite band.\n\nIt can also suggest new artists, playlists, audiobooks, and podcast episodes. Additionally, ChatGPT can perform actions on your behalf, including adding and removing items from your Spotify library.\n\nTarget\n\nImage Credits:Target\n\nRetail giant Target strategically launched a beta version of its ChatGPT integration before Black Friday. This feature allows shoppers to ask the chatbot for gift suggestions and quickly create a shopping basket with multiple items without leaving ChatGPT. For example, users can request ideas for a movie night, and the chatbot will provide a curated selection of available Target items. Shoppers can add these items to their cart and make a purchase using their Target account. They can then choose from same-day “Drive Up,” in-store pickup, or standard shipping.\n\nUber\n\nIf you’re planning a trip, the Uber integration makes it easy to find ride options, which is especially useful if you’re in a new country. You can set up your trip in the ChatGPT app, then complete the ride request and payment in the Uber app.\n\nCurrently, it’s only available in the U.S., and it doesn’t let you book rides in advance; only on-demand rides are available. You can choose from options like UberX, UberXL, Comfort, and Black.\n\nThere’s also an Uber Eats integration for U.S. users, so you can check out local restaurants and menu items within ChatGPT, then finish paying in the Uber Eats app.\n\nZillow\n\nImage Credits:Zillow\n\nIf you’re looking for a new home, Zillow in ChatGPT could make the search experience more straightforward. Using a simple text prompt, you can find homes that meet your criteria and apply filters to narrow the results. Whether you’re looking for a specific price range, number of bedrooms, or particular neighborhoods, you can specify these details in your prompt, making the search process much more efficient and tailored to your needs.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAlongside the announcement that OpenAI would bring apps into ChatGPT, the company also said it plans to welcome additional partners soon, including OpenTable, PayPal, and Walmart. These will launch in 2026.\n\nThe rollout of ChatGPT’s app integrations is currently limited to the U.S. and Canada.

Software could offer a cost-effective way to boost reliability and capacity.", "content": "One of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background.\n\nThat low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch.\n\nElectricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space.\n\nAnd that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.\n\nThis confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.\n\nFor example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.\n\nGridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amidst the data center boom.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nSeveral other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.\n\nBase Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.\n\nOther startups including Texture, Uplight, and Camus are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.\n\nThere’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid.\n\nNvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.\n\nThese changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold.\n\nUtilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability.\n\nSoftware, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction.\n\nAnd that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances.

While Bee was acquired by Amazon, and devices like the Stream ring by Sandbar and a new AI ring from former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky are set to enter the market next year, the jury is still out on the success of wearable AI devices.\n\nAmid all this, Plaud is thriving by targeting professional users with a different approach: a credit card-sized recording device that slips into your wallet. The company says it has shipped more than a million units and that more than 50% of its customers have converted to pro subscriptions.\n\nThe company’s latest iteration, the Plaud Note Pro, launched for pre-order in August two years after the original Note, priced at $179. After using the device for over a month, it has become an essential part of my daily carry – and its ultra-thin design makes that easy.\n\nAt just 0.12 inches thick – about the width of three stacked credit cards – it’s the thinnest AI recording device on the market and easily fits in a wallet or attaches magnetically to the back of your phone.\n\nThe company provides a wallet-like pouch and a magnetic ring accessory that attaches to MagSafe-enabled phones, allowing you to mount the Note Pro on the back of your iPhone or compatible Android device. The device is also very light at 30 grams, and you won’t feel the weight if you keep the Note Pro in your wallet.\n\nOne of the key differences between Plaud and other AI wearables is that the Note Pro doesn’t need to be connected to your phone to record audio. The device has 64GB of onboard memory, so it can store a large volume of recordings without transferring them to your phone or uploading them to the cloud.\n\nPluad Note Pro is as thick as a coaster Image Credits: Ivan Mehta\n\nPlaud Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphones to pick up audio from all directions. While the company advertises that the effective audio range is 16.4 feet, I have recorded talks at conferences while sitting far from the stage and gotten satisfactory results. The device also has one voice processing unit for noise suppression, voice isolation, and echo cancellation.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

I went to a conference earlier this month with a fully charged device and recorded a few interviews and talks there. After that, I used the device for some phone call recording and personal note-taking. Despite all that use, the device still had 55% charge after 15 days. The company says you can wring 30 hours of continuous recording and 60 days of standby from a single charge.\n\nPlaud’s new device comes with a proprietary charger with a USB-C cable on the other end. The device takes two hours to charge from 0%, and then you are set for at least a couple of weeks unless you are recording hours of content.\n\nImage Credits: Plaud Image Credits:Plaud.ai\n\nOne problem with wearable AI devices is that you have to ensure, through an indicator, that the device is recording (or has stopped recording). Thankfully, Plaud Note Pro has a tiny screen that displays your recording status. You can also press a button while recording to highlight a point a speaker is making, and it will show up in the AI-powered summary prominently. The screen also shows you the remaining battery level.\n\nThere is intentionality behind recording with this device. You also get haptic feedback for starting and stopping the recording. The visual indication and your action of pressing the button also make it easier to signal to a others in the meeting that you are recording the session.\n\nImage Credits: Ivan Mehta\n\nYou can choose to just record sessions and export them to another AI transcription service you are subscribed to. Plaud natively provides 300 minutes of free transcription every month. The company also lets you customize AI-generated notes through templates suited for different profiles and tasks. You can create your own template as well. The transcription is accurate in most instances, and now you can also access the recording, transcript, and notes through a website. The company has also addressed the problem my former colleague Brian Heater had of tapping on the word and not being played the corresponding recording.\n\nWhile a pendant or pin-like form factor is possibly easier to carry, the card-sized recorder offers better microphones and more versatile placement options.

By year’s end, hype gave way to a vibe check, with growing scrutiny over sustainability, safety, and business models.", "content": "Money was no object for the AI industry in early 2025. A vibe check crept in the second half of the year.\n\nOpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion valuation. Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machine Labs raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech.\n\nSuch astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta shelled out nearly $15 billion to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending.\n\nThe first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace.\n\nThe era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment?\n\nWe’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself.\n\nHow the year started\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 21: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appears during a news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nIn 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a Softbank-led $40 billion round at a $300 billion post-money valuation. The company also reportedly has investors like Amazon orbiting with compute-tied circular deals, and is in talks to raise $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation. That would bring OpenAI close to the $1 trillion valuation it is reportedly seeking in an IPO next year.\n\nOpenAI rival Anthropic also closed $16.5 billion this year across two rounds, its most recent raise pushed its valuation to $183 billion with heavy hitters like Iconiq Capital, Fidelity, and the Qatar Investment Authority participating. (CEO Dario Amodei confessed to staff in a leaked memo that he was “not thrilled” about taking money from dictatorial Gulf states).\n\nThen there’s Elon Musk’s xAI, which raised at least $10 billion this year after acquiring X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk also owns.\n\nWe’ve also seen smaller, new startups get a hypey boost from froth-mouthed investors.\n\nFormer OpenAI chief technologist Mira Murati’s startup Thinking Machine Labs secured a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation despite sharing almost no information about its product offering. Vibe-coding startup Lovable’s $200 million Series A earned it a unicorn horn just eight months after launching; this month, Lovable raised another $330 million at a nearly $7 billion post-money valuation. And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to $10 billion.\n\nThese absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble.\n\nBuild, baby, build\n\nDominion Energy’s Mount Storm coal-fired power station is planned to power a vast data center complex in West Virginia. (Photo by Ulysse BELLIER / AFP) Image Credits:Getty Images\n\nFor the larger firms, those numbers aren’t coming from nowhere. Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure.\n\nThe result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding with Nvidia. In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.\n\nSome of the biggest deals this year powering the infrastructure boom were:\n\nStargate, a joint venture between Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle, which includes up to $500 billion to build AI infrastructure in the U.S.\n\nAlphabet’s acquisition of energy and data center infrastructure provider Intersect for $4.75 billion, which comes as the company said in October it plans to lift its compute spend in 2026 up to $93 billion.\n\nMeta’s accelerated data center expansion, which has pushed its projected capital expenditures up to $72 billion in 2025 as the company races to secure enough compute to train and run next-generation models.\n\nBut cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently pulled out of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be.\n\nWhether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers – including calls from figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders to rein in data center expansion – are already slowing projects in some regions.\n\nEven as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype.\n\nThe expectation reset\n\nImage Credits:Anthony Kwan / Getty Images\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout.\n\nWhile it was meaningful on paper, it didn’t land with the same punch as earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific.\n\nEven Gemini 3, which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI – which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous ‘code red’ memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.\n\nThere was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of R1, its “reasoning” model that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nFrom model breakthroughs to business models\n\nDemis Hassabis, chief executive officer of DeepMind Technologies Image Credits:Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nAs the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows?\n\nThat shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to sell them hyper-personalized ads. Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI, a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.\n\nMore than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own Comet browser with agentic capabilities and paying Snap $400 million to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels.\n\nOpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own Atlas browser and other consumer-facing features like Pulse, while also courting enterprises and developers by launching apps inside ChatGPT itself.\n\nGoogle, for its part, is leaning on incumbency. On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like Google Calendar, while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting MCP connectors to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge.\n\nIn a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat.\n\nThe trust and safety vibe check\n\nAfter multiple teens died by suicide after prolonged conversations with chatbots, Character AI removed the chatbot experience for under 18s in November 2025. Image Credits:Character.AI\n\nAI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” – the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes – sparked calls for trust and safety reforms.\n\nWhile some copyright battles met their end – like Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors – most are still unresolved. Though the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training, to demands for compensation (See: New York Times sues Perplexity for copyright infringement).\n\nMeanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions – and their sycophantic responses – emerged as a serious public health issue following multiple deaths by suicide and life-threatening delusions in teens and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots.\n\nPerhaps most telling: the calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects.\n\nIndustry leaders have warned against chatbots “juicing engagement,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional over-reliance on ChatGPT.\n\nEven the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to blackmail engineers to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIf 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.\n\nThe era of ‘trust us, the returns will come’ is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia.

While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that we have chips that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run AI-based control software.\n\nLocation via spikes\n\nThe nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.\n\nThe researchers behind the recent work, based in China, decided to implement something similar for an artificial skin that could be used to cover a robotic hand. They limited sensing to pressure, but implemented other things the nervous system does, including figuring out the location of input and injuries, and using multiple layers of processing.\n\nAll of this started out by making a flexible polymer skin with embedded pressure sensors that were linked up to the rest of the system via conductive polymers. The next layer of the system converted the inputs from the pressure sensors to a series of activity spikes—short pulses of electrical current.\n\nThere are three ways that these trains of spikes can convey information: the shape of an individual pulse, through their magnitude, through the length of the spike, and through the frequency of the spikes. Spike frequency is the most commonly used means of conveying information in biological systems, and the researchers use that to convey the pressure experienced by a sensor.

It has become quite popular in bioarchitecture because the carbonized layer protects the wood from water, fire, insects, and fungi, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the wood. Yakisugi techniques were first codified in written form in the 17th and 18th centuries. But it seems Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci wrote about the protective benefits of charring wood surfaces more than 100 years earlier, according to a paper published in Zenodo, an open repository for EU funded research.\n\nCheck the notes\n\nAs previously reported, Leonardo produced more than 13,000 pages in his notebooks (later gathered into codices), less than a third of which have survived. The notebooks contain all manner of inventions that foreshadow future technologies: flying machines, bicycles, cranes, missiles, machine guns, an “unsinkable” double-hulled ship, dredges for clearing harbors and canals, and floating footwear akin to snowshoes to enable a person to walk on water. Leonardo foresaw the possibility of constructing a telescope in his Codex Atlanticus (1490)—he wrote of “making glasses to see the moon enlarged” a century before the instrument’s invention.\n\nIn 2003, Alessandro Vezzosi, director of Italy’s Museo Ideale, came across some recipes for mysterious mixtures while flipping through Leonardo’s notes. Vezzosi experimented with the recipes, resulting in a mixture that would harden into a material eerily akin to Bakelite, a synthetic plastic widely used in the early 1900s. So Leonardo may well have invented the first manmade plastic.\n\nThe notebooks also contain Leonardo’s detailed notes on his extensive anatomical studies. Most notably, his drawings and descriptions of the human heart captured how heart valves can control blood flow 150 years before William Harvey worked out the basics of the human circulatory system.

Since this business model is centered around affiliate marketing, it only works if people retain trust in individual creators. It could be an existential threat if the relationship between creators and their audiences continues to fragment.\n\nBut through a study commissioned from Northwestern University, LTK found that trust in creators increased 21% year-over-year, which was a pleasant surprise to Box.\n\n“If you asked me at the beginning of 2025, ‘Hey, is trust in creators going to go up or down?’ I would have probably said down, because people understand it’s an industry – they understand how it’s working,” she said. “But actually, AI pushed people to kind of rotate trust to real humans that they know have real life experiences.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

According to the study, 97% of chief marketing officers intend to grow influencer marketing budgets in the new year.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that owning these relationships is straightforward. LTK creators, who rely on affiliate income, are betting this AI-induced skepticism will drive people toward more direct relationships through paid fan communities or less algorithmic platforms like LTK itself. For other kinds of creators, such as streamers, video podcasters, and short filmmakers, the strategy for owning their audience can more closely resemble growth hacking.\n\nTeenage clipping armies\n\nAs Sean Atkins, CEO of short-form video production company Dhar Mann Studios, put it, “In a world that’s driven by AI and algorithms, where people trust another human being more in this micro atomization of attention, how do you market when you sort of can’t control that?”\n\nAccording to Eric Wei, cofounder of Karat Financial, a financial services company for creators, creators have a new secret weapon: armies of teenagers on Discord who creators pay to make clips of their content, which those same teenagers post en masse on algorithmic platforms.\n\n“That’s been going on for a bit,” Wei explained. “Drake does it. A lot of the biggest creators and streamers in the world have been doing it – Kai Cenat [a top Twitch streamer] has done it – hitting millions of impressions… If it’s algorithmically determined, clipping suddenly makes sense, because it can come from any random account that just has really good clips.”\n\nWei thinks that clipping is going to become even more popular this year, since it’s a reaction to this fragmentation in social media relationships. Even the biggest creators are finding it hard to reach their fans directly, which is why they turn to clipping. While going viral on these algorithmic feeds is certainly easier if you have a ton of followers, you don’t need any track-record on a platform for it to decide that your video should be distributed more broadly. So, if these “clippers” post a short highlight from certain creators’ streams, they can earn money based on how many views the video gets.\n\n“Clipping feels like an evolution of meme accounts,” Glenn Ginsburg, president of QYOU Media, which produces content for young audiences, told TechCrunch. “It’s become a race among many creators to try and take this content and push it out far and wide, almost competing to see who can get the most views on the same IP.”\n\nReed Duchscher – founding CEO of Night, the talent management company that represents Kai Cenat and other top creators – masterfully coaches creators through maximizing their virality. As MrBeast’s former manager, Duchscher helped cultivate the fast-paced, attention-grabbing style that transformed MrBeast from a YouTuber to an empire. He’s also behind Kai Cenat’s clipping strategy, though Duchscher isn’t quite as enthusiastic about its broader potential as Wei.\n\n“Clipping is important if you’re a creator, because you do need to flood the zone with content, and it’s a good way to get your face out there,” Duchscher told TechCrunch. “It’s also very hard to get to scale, because there’s only so many clippers on the internet, so to spend large media budgets… there’s just a lot of complications.”\n\nPerhaps clipping only works now because the technique has not yet become so prevalent that it’s seen as spam.\n\n“The creator wins because they get more of their content out,” Wei said. “The clippers win because now this army of teenagers are getting paid. Everybody wins, except that if you take this to its logical conclusion, we just get lots and lots of slop.”\n\nThe more niche, the better\n\nThe prevalence of slop on social media has become enough of a threat that Merriam-Webster called slop its word of the year.\n\n“Over 94% of people are saying that social media is no longer social, and over half of them are rotating time elsewhere into smaller niche communities that they know are real and that they can talk to and interact with,” Box said, pointing to platforms like Strava, LinkedIn, and Substack.\n\nAs the relationship between a creator and their audience becomes more difficult to maintain, Duchscher predicts that creators with more specific niches will succeed – he thinks that “macro creators” like MrBeast, PewDiePie, or Charli D’Amelio, who amass hundreds of millions of followers, will become even harder to emulate.\n\nPointing to success stories like like Alix Earle or Outdoor Boys, who have millions of followers but not necessarily mass appeal, Duchscher adds, “Algorithms have gotten so good at giving us exactly the content we want. It’s much harder for a creator to break out into every niche algorithm.”\n\nAtkins agrees, arguing that the creator economy extends far beyond entertainment. “The creator economy generally is viewed through this lens of entertainment.

Jyoti Bansal, a founder-turned-investor; Medha Agarwal of Defy; and Jennifer Neundorfer of January Ventures shared with the crowd their candid views on what works in a pitch deck — and what doesn’t.\n\nTheir biggest pet peeve? Buzzword overload.\n\nThe more a founder says AI in the pitch, Agarwal said, the less AI the company likely uses. “The people who are doing things that are really innovative, they’ll talk about it, and it’s built in, but it’s not the core of their pitch,” she told the audience.\n\nBansal, who built and sold multiple companies before becoming an investor, distilled investor expectations into three core questions. First, he asks whether there is a large enough market to tackle. Does the founder’s idea have the potential to become a huge company? And is the problem he or she is solving actually worth solving?\n\nThe second thing investors want to know is why this founder is the one who should be building the company. “There has to be something unique about you,” Bansal told the crowd, adding that this included having special members on the founding team or having special skills. “Why would you win? If the problem is interesting, there will be 20 other companies trying to solve it, so why would you win and what’s your opportunity?”\n\nThe third thing investors want to see, Bansal said, is some validation. “Traction with customers,” he said. “Validation could be initial customer feedback, revenue, something, but some kind of validation.”\n\nThese three questions, Bansal noted, all lead to the ultimate litmus test: Could this become a billion-dollar company?\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Bansal emphasized the importance of domain expertise and a clear competitive strategy. Neundorfer said the companies that catch her attention are those enabling new behaviors rather than simply improving an existing process incrementally.\n\nAgarwal offered more tactical advice to founders, saying they should explain how AI technology enables their product; articulate clear go-to-market strategies; and demonstrate how their business will be more efficient than incumbents.\n\nIt’s also very important to be honest about what competitors are out there, she added. Some of you have “lost some credibility with me because you didn’t have it on your slide,” she told the founders in the audience.\n\nFinally, the investors shared advice for navigating the rapidly evolving landscape.

The clip showed an AI agent that could do things like screen job candidates, plan vacations, and analyze stock portfolios. Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research.\n\nBy April, just weeks after launch, the early-stage firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million. General partner Chetan Puttagunta joined the board. Some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China).\n\nThough Bloomberg raised questions when Manus started charging $39 or $199 a month for access to its AI models (the outlet noted the pricing seemed “somewhat aggressive . . . for a membership service still in a testing phase,”) the company recently announced it had since signed up millions of users and crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nThat’s when Meta started negotiating with Manus, according to the WSJ, which says Meta is paying $2 billion — the same valuation Manus was seeking for its next funding round.\n\nFor Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta’s future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that’s actually making money (investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta’s $60 billion infrastructure spending spree).\n\nMeta says it’ll keep Manus running independently while weaving its agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where Meta’s own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, asking back in May on X who thought it was “a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me.”\n\nCornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress’s most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he’s hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Meta has already told Nikkei Asia that after the acquisition, Manus won’t have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:39:08 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T05:42:03.780304"}

As of January 1, 2026, the government will levy a 13 percent value-added tax (VAT) on various contraceptives, including condoms.\n\nThe decision amends the Value Added Tax Law, which in 1993 exempted birth control products from taxation. At the time, the measure was part of China’s effort to contain its accelerating population growth. However, that policy has become a hindrance to the world's second-largest economy, whose growth and stability are under pressure due to its markedly aging population and declining birth rate.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics reported that in 2024 China recorded a slight uptick with the birth of 9.54 million babies, around 520,000 more than in 2023. However, the birth rate per 1,000 stood at 6.77 last year, matching the second-lowest level observed in the history of the People's Republic of China, in 2022. The lowest rate was in 2023 at 6.39 per 1,000.\n\nThe country’s total population has been declining steadily for the past three years. In 2024, there were just over 1.408 billion inhabitants, representing a year-on-year decline of 1.39 million. In April 2023, India overtook China as the world's most populous country.\n\nSpecialists warn that this trend will have a profound effect on the economy of America's main rival. A report by Oxford Economics notes that potential output growth (an indicator measuring the maximum expansion that can be achieved without generating inflationary pressure) could fall below 4 percent in the 2030s due to a shrinking labor force and a slowdown in productivity.\n\nSince 2021, Chinese authorities have launched various initiatives to reverse population decline. These include what they call “the new culture of marriage and motherhood,” a policy that supports families with a mother, a father and three children by granting subsidies for each birth. It also expands childcare services and extends paternity and maternity leave. In addition, the country discourages abortions by classifying the procedure as nonessential treatment.\n\nDespite these efforts, experts believe China’s chances of reversing its low birth rate are slim, especially since it is one of the most expensive countries in which to raise children. According to a 2024 analysis by the YuWa Population Research Institute, the average cost of raising a child to the age of 18 is around 538,000 yen (about $76,000).\n\nIn this context, demographer He Yafu explained in statements quoted in Bloomberg that “the elimination of the VAT exemption is largely a symbolic effort and is unlikely to generate a significant impact on a national scale.”\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T10:32:09.679665"}

Meanwhile, coal plants are on their way out and electricity-sucking data centers are meeting huge pushback. Welcome to the next front in the energy battle.", "content": "Take yourself back to 2017. Get Out and The Shape of Water were playing in theaters, Zohran Mamdani was still known as rapper Young Cardamom, and the Trump administration, freshly in power, was eager to prop up its favored energy sources.\n\nThat year, the administration introduced a series of subsidies for struggling coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants, which were facing increasing price pressures from gas and cheap renewables. The plan would have put taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars. It didn’t work.\n\nIn subsequent years, the nuclear industry kept running into roadblocks. Three nuclear plants have shut down since 2020, while construction of two of the only four reactors started since 2000 was put on hold after a decade and billions of dollars following a political scandal. Coal, meanwhile, continued its long decline: It comprises just 17 percent of the US power mix, down from a high of 45 percent in 2010.\n\nNow, both of these energy sources are getting second chances. The difference this time is the buzz around AI, but it isn’t clear that the outcome will be much different.\n\nexpired: canceling nuclear tired: canceling coal wired: the free market Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nThroughout 2025, the Trump administration has not just gone all in on promoting nuclear, but positioned it specifically as a solution to AI’s energy needs. In May, the president signed a series of executive orders intended to boost nuclear energy in the US, including ordering 10 new large reactors to be constructed by 2030. A pilot program at the Department of Energy created as a result of May’s executive orders—coupled with a serious reshuffling of the country’s nuclear regulator—has already led to breakthroughs from smaller startups. Energy secretary Chris Wright said in September that AI’s progress “will be accelerated by rapidly unlocking and deploying commercial nuclear power.”\n\nThe administration’s push is mirrored by investments from tech companies. Giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have inked numerous deals in recent years with nuclear companies to power data centers; Microsoft even joined the World Nuclear Association. Multiple retired reactors in the US are being considered for restarts—including two of the three that have closed in the past five years—with the tech industry supporting some of these arrangements. (This includes Microsoft’s high-profile restart of the infamous Three Mile Island, which is also being backed by a $1 billion loan from the federal government.) It’s a good time for both the private and public sectors to push nuclear: public support for nuclear power is the highest it’s been since 2010.\n\nDespite all of this, the practicalities of nuclear energy leave its future in doubt. Most of nuclear’s costs come not from onerous regulations but from construction. Critics are wary of juiced-up valuations for small modular reactor companies, especially those with deep connections to the Trump administration. An $80 billion deal the government struck with reactor giant Westinghouse in October is light on details, leaving more questions than answers for the industry. And despite high-profile tech deals that promise to get reactors up and running in a few years, the timelines remain tricky.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T11:26:50.895751"}

It could also become a meaningful way to reflect and grow as a person.\n\nFor more than 10 years, I've written a few words every morning, and what I've learned from this practice has changed my life. My only regret is not starting sooner.\n\nIf you're interested in adding a daily journaling practice to your life, these tips and tools can help you not only get started, but also stick with it.\n\nWhy Keep a Journal or Diary?\n\nMy diary is a tool for clearing out my thoughts, recording details of my life that are sometimes useful to know later, and reflecting. The value in reflecting, however, only became apparent after I'd been writing for several years and could look back on my life to see it from a different perspective.\n\nI've always been very hard on myself. I don't make excuses, and I look upon my failures with consternation. Whenever I've gone back and read a series of diary entries from low points in my life, I've been able to view them with an outsider's perspective. I can see more clearly just how tough things were, or how many things went wrong at once, or the gravity of a single event that I might have downplayed in the moment. This reflection has led me to be more compassionate toward myself—and toward others. I have learned to cut myself some slack.\n\nYou might discover something else, whether a pattern of behavior or something you want to change. Or maybe with hindsight you realize the things you thought you wanted to change don't need changing at all. Journaling sheds light on all these things.\n\nMemory is fickle. The personal self-reflection that we do entirely in our heads differs wildly from what we can do with notes. In short, that's why I've kept up my daily writing for more than 10 years.\n\nWhat Should You Write in Your Journal?\n\nStart every diary entry with the date and your location. Why bother if your computer or phone can add them automatically? A few reasons. First, you will never stare at a blank page, and you will always know how to start. Second, metadata can get bungled over time or during file transfers, so it’s more reliable to add them manually. Third, typing the date and location into the diary entry itself ensures that those very important pieces of information are searchable.\n\nWhat else should you write? A diary entry can be a simple brain dump. That's what I do. Other things worth mentioning are major events, strong emotions, and hopes and dreams.\n\nIf following a method helps, you could try gratitude journaling. Some parents I know ask their kids at the end of the day to reflect on their \"rose, thorn, bud\"—one highlight from the day, one difficulty, and something they're looking forward to—which is an equally good diary formula.\n\nHow to Make It a Habit\n\nThe best trick I have for forming a new habit is to tie it to an existing one. Find a habit that you already have and combine it with a few minutes of daily writing.\n\nI journal every morning as soon as I have coffee in front of me. My coffee-making routine is non-negotiable, immovable, set in stone, seven days a week. Even when I stay in a hotel, I bring a travel coffee maker with me, and I write in my diary while drinking the coffee.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T11:26:51.175751"}

The Neo Smartpen M1+ is the thinnest and lightest of all the pens I tried, which makes it feel a bit more like your standard pen. Importantly, it's comfortable to hold and use. You should be able to find whatever size and style of notebook you need as well as planners. The Neo Studio app (iOS, Android) is nice, with an easy-to-navigate notebook system and the ability to search for pages by page number or date. You can change the color of the ink and thickness of the lines right on the page as you go, or you can switch them up later and edit the colors of what you've written. —Medea Giodiano\n\nMoleskine Smart Writing Set for $279: Moleskine has garnered a devoted following for its classic notebooks and journals, but it has also moved into smart territory. The Smart Writing Set gets you a notebook and pen bundle, so this is the best option for most people starting out. Write in the notebook, and it'll appear in the companion app! But you can buy the pen on its own, as well as the smart notebooks and planners in various sizes. The Moleskine Notes 2.0 app (iOS, Android) was easy to use once I settled into it. An older version of the app is available for download, but the 2.0 version is more streamlined. A pop-up let me know that 2.0 is still a work in progress and I might need to switch back to the older version if my device is having trouble, but my iPhone 11 didn't have any issues. I tested the $149 2018 version of the Smart Writing Set, which is no longer available, but we plan to test the latest version soon. —Medea Giordano\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nThe 3rd Gen Kindle Scribe (left) and the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. Photograph: Nena Farrell\n\nBoox Note Air3 C for $450: This model was a solid all-around performer. It has a more complicated ecosystem than our top picks, but also more capabilities to compare with a standard tablet. This version has been discontinued, but there's a new version, the Note Air4 C ($530), which we now recommend above.\n\nKindle Scribe Colorsoft ($630) and Kindle Scribe (3rd Gen) ($500): The new versions of the Kindle Scribe are still solid all-around devices that have a good mix of e-reader and digital notebook features, but I still prefer the older model. While the new Scribe Colorsoft is a nice option if you want color, I think both are too expensive for what they are. The price comes from all the AI features packed into the device, but I don't think any reader or digital notetaker was asking for more of those. Our picks above are a better price for similar features, though the Scribe does have the most impressive battery life of any digital notebook device I've tried (and that's still true for the older model that I recommend above, too, so you don't need the newest model for the best battery life).\n\nMontblanc Digital Paper for $905: Yes, that Montblanc, the one with the famous pens, now has a digital notebook of its own. It's no surprise that I'd call its digital pen one of the best. It's got a super-lightweight feel while sporting three different buttons, two of which you can customize. (There's no eraser, but I'll give it up for that end of the pen to instead be a home button). I really like this device overall, but it's pricey for what you get—aside from the customizable pen buttons, there's not much to differentiate it from my top picks.\n\nNeo Smartpen Dimo for $59: This is the cheapest smart pen option and uses replaceable batteries. It isn't compatible with Google Calendar, iCal, or Outlook like our other picks.\n\nRocketbook Fusion Plus for $38: If you really prefer the paper experience and don't want something you need to charge, then Rocketbook is for you. Rocketbook makes several reusable notebooks, planners, and accessories like index cards and sticky notes. I like the Rocketbook Fusion Plus since it comes with a ton of different template styles, from your classic monthly and weekly pages to project management layouts and meeting notes, making it feel closer to the variety a digital notebook can offer you. Take notes with an erasable Pilot Frixion Pen (one comes with whichever item you buy), scan photos of the pages into the Rocketbook app, and erase the whole thing with the damp microfiber cloth (also included). The app is designed to keep everything organized and easily send things off to Google Drive, Slack, Trello, OneNote, and a handful of other options.\n\nSupernote A6 X2 Nomad for $394 (with Standard Pen): This is a smaller version of the Supernote A5 X2 Manta, measuring almost 6 inches on one side and 7.5 inches on the other. Supernote designed it with travel in mind, but I find it to be a great size for a daily digital to-do list or writing down quick notes from a meeting. It's too small for anything major, but if you're looking for something compact, this is a good option with Supernote's software (and with the same fantastic pens!). Like the Manta above, this model rose in price due to the tariffs, though it only went up $30.\n\nFAQs Do You Need a Digital Note-Taking Device? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The short answer is no. These devices are expensive, usually costing several hundred dollars when a simple notebook and pen costs a few bucks. But if you like the physical act of writing but need to have digital copies, they're worth considering. Pros: Digital notebooks are thin and light but hold hundreds of notes.\n\nYou can transcribe your notes into text files, making them easier to read and manipulate.\n\nDepending on the device, you can export files as PDFs, Google Docs, Evernote files, and more.\n\nInstantly digitizes your art too. Cons: Expensive.\n\nNeed to be charged.\n\nHave a learning curve.\n\nMost smart pens need to be paired with an accompanying notebook. The upcoming Nuwa Pen promises smart notes on any paper. What About an iPad? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron E Ink notebooks are easier on the eyes and feel closer to paper than a glass-screened tablet. But in some cases, you might spend less getting an iPad and an Apple Pencil (and a keyboard if you also want to type sometimes). You can also do more on them thanks to the thousands of apps in the App Store. An iPad is pretty intuitive if you're familiar with the Apple ecosystem (though both ReMarkable and Supernote's ecosystems are also very intuitive). Former WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey recommended using her 11-inch iPad Pro with the GoodNotes and Notability apps for her writing, but there are other models that should work fine, including our top pick, the 2025 iPad. Check our our guide to the Best iPads for more advice on which to buy. I also have an iPad, and I'll say the upside of a digital notebook is that the battery tends to last longer, especially if you're the type to use it for a day or two and then forget about it for a few days. My trusty Kindle Scribe usually manages to have plenty of battery available for whenever I feel the note-taking itch, even if it's been a week or two since I last touched it. Why Are Digital Notebooks So Expensive? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Just because these devices look like paper doesn't mean they're as cheap to make as a sheet of paper. Like any tablet or smart phone, these devices are packed with features, a special ecosystem, and the E Ink technology is no small feat to perfect, along with a sensation similar to writing on paper. It's an impressive piece of technology. Prices haven't gotten cheaper for this category in the wake of tariffs' causing technology prices to rise. ReMarkable did recently raise the price of our top pick, the ReMarkable Paper Pro. Another favorite of ours from Supernote has gone up a little less than $50, and Kobo also slightly raised its prices, though the $10 increase is pretty minor compared to other increases we’ve seen. We'll continue to monitor prices and flag if more price changes are to come.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

The Department of Justice had urged Apple to remove Aaron’s app from its App Store, which the suit called unconstitutional. And Apple had complied — in the process, setting its own precedent for suppressing anti-ICE speech.\n\nThe year 2025 has marked perhaps the biggest leap back for American free speech in generations. The Trump administration’s war on immigrants and civil liberties has led it to attempt to deport organizers and researchers over political speech, weaponize the Federal Communications Commission to crack down on disfavored broadcast shows, and file multiple frivolous lawsuits against journalists that covered Trump, many of which reached settlements that look a lot like shakedowns.\n\nImmigration restrictions, heavy-handed regulation, civil lawsuits, bad-faith prosecutions — these are all longtime tools to shut down speech and criticism. But the administration has also moved to control private speech gatekeepers. With the formalization of the deal to sell TikTok to a consortium including the Ellison-helmed Oracle coming in just under the wire, we are ending 2025 with every major social media platform fully or partially controlled by Trump-friendly US billionaires, the same year that, for the first time, most people in the country reported getting their news from social media. The consolidation of social media control and its broad influence give the administration a very powerful, newer tool, one that ironically began as an effort to preserve and protect online discourse: content moderation.\n\nWe are ending 2025 with every major social media platform fully or partially controlled by Trump-friendly US billionaires\n\nThe Trump administration had suggested, without evidence, that ICEBlock put agents at risk. His is the first such lawsuit after big tech companies went on a spree of blocking his and similar tools, including Eyes Up, an app that was designed to archive and catalog footage of past ICE operations. For all of these takedowns, platforms like Apple and Google cited supposed violations of content policies, including, notably, removing Red Dot and DeICER by classifying ICE agents as a vulnerable group.\n\n“I talked to a couple of sort of longtime trust and safety people who did this kind of work inside platforms for years, and they were like, ‘we can’t speak to Apple’s policy, but I’ve never seen a policy like that, where cops are a protected class,’” said Daphne Keller, a onetime associate general counsel at Google who is now director of platform regulation at the Stanford Program in Law, Science & Technology. “My read on the situation is that they really needed to make this concession to the government for whatever reason — because of whatever pressure they were under or whatever benefit they thought they would get from making the concession — and they did it, and then they had to find an excuse.”\n\nPlatform content moderation is a notion only about as old as the relatively new social media and technology platforms themselves, but has generally been understood to be a balance between free expression and the need to protect vulnerable groups or populations. The inversion of this concept — using moderation to restrict speech to protect the state acting against vulnerable populations — is a disconcerting and relatively new phenomenon here in the United States, though one that has already become a modus operandi elsewhere.\n\nPlatform content moderation is a notion only about as old as the relatively new social media and technology platforms themselves\n\nOne Carnegie Endowment paper published last year, focused on India and Thailand, detailed how governments in those countries had used the language and infrastructure of platforms’ content moderation and community standards systems to restrain criticism and push a message. India under Narendra Modi, for example, had imposed “national security” restrictions that were mostly levied against civil society, using a multipronged approach of legal, economic, and political pressure.\n\nSangeeta Mahapatra, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies and a coauthor of the paper, stressed that while researchers are loath to extrapolate findings too much to new contexts with their own complexities, it was clear the US government was walking the same path. “We have seen this game played so many times that by now there is a kind of predictability,” she said. “The wolves are right at the door. You realize how this is an everyday phenomenon. It’s not something that is episodic, these kinds of intrusions into your life and the starring role that a platform plays, not just as an enabler, but as a proactive enabler.”\n\nMahapatra stressed that, while a lot of the public framing — and indeed administration officials’ own gloating — was around the Justice Department or Homeland Security having forced or required the companies to take these apps down, the pressure was, at the time the decisions were made, purely rhetorical, and these companies have on occasion forcefully pushed back on perceived government strong-arming. A decade ago, Apple famously went on the legal and rhetorical offensive to block demands by the FBI to create software to override iPhone security as the agency attempted to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter.\n\nNow, though, there’s what she called a “co-production of digital authoritarianism” in which the government doesn’t really have to do that much to expect some level of compliance. “When you see Apple taking down apps proactively, it’s not something that has started with Trump, it’s a pattern that we have been observing for quite some time now. We have seen it in South Asia especially, India especially, a very lucrative market.”\n\nIt can be legitimately difficult to distinguish government speech suppression from standard political rhetoric\n\nKeller noted that “there is a narrative from the Republican side right now about how they are free speech warriors who are really mad about how the Biden administration was censoring speech online.” Yet, “politicians on both sides have always tried to get platforms to take down content, and it’s always been to serve their interests or their policy preferences.” In that environment, it can be legitimately difficult to find out what’s the usual rhetoric and what crosses a First Amendment line.\n\nBut, as she pointed out, Trump et al. have not exactly been subtle; less than two weeks before taking office again, Trump said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Trump-friendly changes to his platforms’ content policies were “probably” a result of the incoming president’s threat to jail Zuckerberg. As the ICEBlock lawsuit lays out, not only did the administration lean on Apple to take down the app, high-level officials including Attorney General Pam Bondi, immigration coordinator Tom Homan, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem went on to gloat about how they directly triggered the removal.\n\nThe ability of regular people to be alerted to ICE sightings and then film and distribute the results has been important not only in a broad narrative sense, but for concrete, practical applications like forming the basis of judicial interventions. In mid-October, US District Judge Sara Ellis ordered Customs and Border Protection agents under the command of Trump henchman and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino to follow use of force guidelines and wear body cameras after TV and bystander footage showed agents violently clashing with protesters. These body-worn cameras were then the basis for the judge’s finding that Bovino and his agents were lying to her in their descriptions of their operations (including the finding that agents apparently used ChatGPT to write at least one use of force report).\n\nWith an administration that has proven itself ready, willing, and able to lie over and over to the public, the media, Congress, and the courts, the accounts and records produced and compiled by the community, reporters, and researchers seems to be the only reliable corpus of evidence about what the federal agencies are actually doing on the ground — the warrantless arrests, the excessive force, the profiling. Having platforms willing to outright block avenues for people to know about, observe, and archive the footage of these operations poses a concrete risk to the public’s ability to know what’s going on at all.\n\nThe administration wants to shut down competition in the narrative-building game\n\nMahapatra said she’d been working with local partners including journalists and civic organizations on “record-keeping, all the receipts, so that the digital trace, evidence, is not lost, and there is some accountability mechanism… if you don’t document, the narrative capture becomes more unclear, more enduring and long-term.”\n\nThis federal push to tank these tools can also be understood through the lens of the administration working to shut down a competitor in the narrative-building game. It’s no secret that under Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security fancies itself not only a law enforcement and security clearinghouse but very much a propaganda organ for the administration’s anti-immigration political project. DHS has been sending out its own photographers to help produce slick, movie trailer-like footage of its operations, runs trollish recruitment ads that emphasize the dog-whistle “western values” preoccupations of its leaders, and has shelled out over $200 million for ad campaigns, including to a firm tied to Noem herself.\n\nKeller referenced a now-infamous nighttime Chicago raid where heavily armed agents, some in helicopters, laid siege to an apartment building in an operation that the administration used as fodder for a heavily produced video. “An idea is this is a media war, of who can get the most compelling footage for their side,” she said. “That’s what ICE was doing in that moment, and it’s what they’re trying to prevent the activists from doing by getting the apps down, to the extent that the apps are really about pulling people together and getting video and documenting what is going on.”\n\nSocial media moderation and bad-faith utilization of terms of service as weapons in the speech wars are a little more abstract than having political organizers detained, even with how ham-fisted the administration has ultimately been about it, but it’s arguably a much more wide-ranging and effective way of influencing and controlling what speech is available. Now that Trump and team have had a taste, and seen how apparently easy it is to get the companies to play ball, why wouldn’t they keep reaching?\n\nThe platforms might have been acting out of expediency, but now that they’ve opened Pandora’s box, it’s hard to tell what the administration might push for. If ICE personnel are now a protected class under Apple’s rules, does that mean that the company could enforce hate speech standards against those criticizing agents? If not, why not? “I would expect they didn’t really think through the implications of, are they really going to interpret policy that way in the future,” said Keller.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-30T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T13:01:50.408279"}

Launched in 1982, the 8-bit machine—iconic in its beige plastic shell with integrated keyboard—went on to become the best-selling personal computer of all time. Despite the success, manufacturer Commodore International folded in 1994, with rights to the name floating around for years.\n\nThen, retro gaming YouTuber Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson got the bright idea to buy the company wholesale and re-create its most important piece of hardware. This isn't the first effort to resurrect the Commodore 64, but this particular reborn rig might be the best attempt yet. It’s a near-perfect replica of that 43-year old titan, one that looks, sounds, and feels like the original. It is, by any measure, a frankly extraordinary achievement—but it’s not going to be for everyone.\n\nPhotograph: Matt Kamen\n\nEverything Old Is Old Again\n\nDubbed the Commodore 64 Ultimate, the old-new (or new-old?) device looks like a relic of the ’80s—and I mean that as a compliment. It bears the same all-in-one wedge-shaped design as the original, the same chunky keys, even the same overall color palette for the beige model (it’s also available in a transparent “Starlight” model with RGB lighting and, for early buyers, a golden “Founder’s Edition”). If it weren’t for the distinctly un-yellowed plastic shell, it could be mistaken at a glance for the real thing, leftover stock straight from 1982.\n\nFor some, that will be the most compelling thing about the C64U—it is the real thing, sort of. At its core, this is a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device, an approach most often seen to re-create classic game consoles (as with the recent Analogue3D “remake” of the Nintendo 64).

In a traditional hi-fi set-up, the loudspeakers are always “passive”—which is to say, they don’t produce their own power. Instead, they must receive an amplified audio signal from an external source, aptly called an amplifier, in order to do their thing. Even in a more modern, self-contained audio system (like the Sonos Era 100, for example), the drivers that produce the sound must be amplified in order to function—this just all happens in a singular box rather than across hi-fi separates.\n\nBut if you've heard about amplifiers, you may have also heard about preamplifiers (often referred to as “preamps”) and wondered where they fit into an audio system, and whether you need one. Let's answer those questions, shall we?\n\nWhat Does a Preamp Do?\n\nAn audio signal needs plenty of attention before it’s ready to be amplified—so ultimately the question “what does a preamp do?” broadly contains its own answer. A preamplifier takes care of everything that needs to be done before the audio signal (sent from the music source) is amplified and sent onwards to the system’s speakers.\n\nIn a self-contained audio system like the Sonos speaker, the preamplifier and the amplifier are in the same enclosure, along with the speaker drivers that actually deliver the sound. Even in a more sophisticated hi-fi separates setup, the preamplifier part of proceedings is still often handled out of sight, within the amplifier. These types of amps are known as “integrated amplifiers” and contain both preamp and amplifier functionality.\n\nHowever, some people prefer to separate out this functionality, which is when you may come across a preamplifier as its own piece of equipment, paired with a power amplifier. In these cases, the preamplifier allows you to select the source of music you’d like to hear (the majority have a selection of input options in order to support a system with multiple sources), and also set and adjust the volume.\n\nThe preamp also ensures the audio signal is at “line level”—that is, the standard voltage strength of an audio signal transmitted between components—and sends it on to be amplified, ready to be moved onwards, finally, to the speakers.\n\nDoes an External Preamp Improve Sound Quality?\n\nHi-fi orthodoxy says that individual functions in any system should be kept as separate as possible if the best results are to be achieved. The thinking goes that, by keeping electrical activity as shielded and self-contained as possible, the audio signal has the best shot at remaining as pure and uncolored as possible.\n\nBy dividing the preamplifier and the amplifier functions into separate boxes, there should be a reduction in electrical noise and interference around the signal compared to having it all crammed into a single box.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T13:01:51.111692"}

Despite the changing winds, EV infrastructure continues to be built out and, anecdotally at least, feels far more reliable.

When Geely bought the British Automaker in 2017, many of us hoped that the Chinese company would do for Lotus what it did for Volvo, only in Hethel instead of Gothenburg. Even before tariffs and other protectionist measures undermined the wisdom of building new Lotuses in China, the fact that most of these new cars were big, heavy EVs had already made them a hard sell. But a more traditional Lotus exists and is still built in Norfolk, England: the Lotus Emira.\n\nIts V6 engine is from Toyota, so it should be pretty bulletproof, and there are three pedals and a proper gearstick to change your own gears. Geely’s parts bin means modern infotainment and switchgear—always troublesome for low-volume, resource-challenged car companies—and the electrohydraulic steering bristles with feel. Sure, most people will play it safe and instead go for the Porsche 718 Cayman, but we’re glad the Emira exists.\n\n9th: Volvo V60 Cross Country\n\nThe last time I drove a V60 Cross Country, I was wrong about it.

If you're in need of an impeccably [&#8230;]", "content": "is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.\n\nCanon’s new EOS R6 Mark III is an excellent camera. It’s not a groundbreaking upgrade to the 3-year-old R6 Mark II, but it takes the same body with great ergonomics and adds more resolution, video that now goes up to 7K with open-gate filming, and improved autofocus performance. If you’re in need of an impeccably good all-around camera for anything from wildlife photography to weddings and videography, you can’t go wrong. It’s an easy recommendation, especially if you already shoot Canon and are due for an upgrade. (But a used R6 Mark II is also very appealing if the higher $2,799.99 price is too lofty.)\n\nBut the lens Canon launched alongside this camera? It’s something special. As a lover of fast-aperture glass, I’m absolutely obsessed with it. And it’s everything I want to see more of in the world of lenses.\n\nSub-$500 is “cheap”\n\nThe RF 45mm f/1.2 STM lens is a rare breed. It costs $469.99 — an unheard-of price in the photo / video world for an f/1.2 maximum aperture. That kind of price for a lens this fast is usually reserved for manual focus lenses from lesser-known third parties like Rokinon or Meike. Canon is notorious for not allowing third-party manufacturers to make lenses for its full-frame RF mount, so it’s created some of its own artificial scarcity that makes its new 45mm stand out further. Canon’s own RF 50mm f/1.2 L USM lens costs an eye-watering $2,600. And even a cheaper Sigma 50mm f/1.2 DG DN lens for other Sony and L-mount systems costs over $1,500. Hitting a sub-$500 price makes a fast-aperture lens like Canon’s 45mm accessible to more than pros and deep-pocketed enthusiasts.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n1 / 3 This thing is tiny. Here it is next to my workhorse 50mm f/1.2.\n\nBut the 45mm f/1.2 isn’t just cheap, it’s a great lens. It’s very compact for full-frame glass with such a wide aperture, making it a perfect everyday carry combo with an R6 or smaller R8 body. This isn’t a “pro” lens like Canon’s L models, so it lacks weather sealing. And a lens hood for extra protection and flare prevention costs an additional $59. But I never expect weather resistance on full-frame lenses at this price, and I’d personally not bother with a hood — keeping this package as compact and grab-and-go as possible. As someone who often lugs around a bigger and heavier Sony FE 50mm f/1.2 GM lens (weighing 778 grams / 1.72 pounds), even sometimes to family events and social gatherings, I’m absolutely jealous of this little Canon. It weighs nearly a full pound less than my lens, and it’s much less bulky.\n\nSample photos:\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 29 An f/1.2 lens is a great match for cozy holiday vibes.\n\nDoes the 45mm f/1.2 optically stack up to the bigger, pro-focused f/1.2 lenses of the world? No, of course not. But its “good enough” level of image quality and the looks it can capture are so pleasant, I’m inclined not to care about its technical shortcomings. The RF 45mm is all about its wide-aperture look, with super shallow depth of field and lots of background blur (often referred to by the Japanese word “bokeh”) behind close subjects. It’s fairly sharp in the center of the frame at its wide-open f/1.2. It gets a little mushy in the corners of the frame, but that’s reasonable for this price. And you’re likely to place your subjects (e.g., close-up portraits of people) near the lens’s sweet spot in the center anyway, so most attention will be on the sharpest part of the frame.\n\nThis isn’t a “dreamy” lens, or one filled with “character” — which are photo nerd code words for soft lenses. I’ve left the aperture set to f/1.2 nearly the entire time I’ve used the 45mm and rarely been disappointed by its rendering. If I owned a Canon system, this lens would be my default choice for everyday slice-of-life shots. Hell, if Canon built this lens into a compact camera like a Fujifilm X100 or Leica Q of its own, I’d buy it as an everyday carry camera. (Bring back the Canonet, you cowards!)\n\nComparison photos with the Sony FE 50mm f/1.2 GM:\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 Canon RF 45mm f/1.2 STM wide open at f/1.2.\n\nThe RF 45mm of course isn’t without its flaws. Its biggest drawback is artifacting in high-contrast areas, where you see purple or green color fringing in front and behind the point of focus. This is a common issue in lower-cost lenses with big apertures, called longitudinal chromatic aberration (often referred to as “LoCa”). And you can get a lot of it in the 45mm, especially if you like shooting holiday string lights this time of year. It’s distracting and borderline annoying, especially when pixel-peeping, but for an f/1.2 of this size and price I can cope.\n\nI’ll admit that I’m kind of a sucker for this lens. I love fast primes and good value. While it’s amazing how good most lenses from Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fujifilm, etc. are these days, they keep climbing in price as they reach new levels of image quality and autofocus performance. We need more lenses like the RF 45mm f/1.2: very fast, affordable primes that are compact enough to take almost anywhere. It makes compromises on image quality, but they’re the right ones for a look and feel you can’t get anywhere else at this price.\n\nPhotography by Antonio G.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nThe newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.\n\nOracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.\n\nA White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.\n\nByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.\n\n​The deal is scheduled to close on January 22, 2026.\n\nWhat users in the U.S. should know\n\nReports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\n\nThe drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\n\nA month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\n\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.\n\nIn response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\n\nFast-forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\n\nThere have been several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.\n\nImage Credits:Justin Sullivan / Getty Images\n\nAnother group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.\n\nOthers in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThe story has been updated after publication.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T14:27:28.195130"}

But some of it was horrifying in a good way.\n\nExtraordinary medical cases—even the grisly and disturbing ones—offer a reprieve from the onslaught of current events and the stresses of our daily lives. With those remarkable reports, we can marvel at the workings, foibles, and resilience of the human body. They can remind us of the shared indignities from our existence in these mortal meatsacks. We can clear our minds of worry by learning about something we never even knew we should worry about—or by counting our blessings for avoiding so far. And sometimes, the reports are just grotesquely fascinating.\n\nEvery year, there’s a new lineup of such curious clinical conditions. There are always some unfortunate souls to mark medical firsts or present ultra-rare cases. There is also an endless stream of humans making poor life choices—and arriving at an emergency department with the results. This year was no different.\n\nThe top five medical cases of 2025 were chosen using a blend of editorial judgment and reader interest. There’s a mix of cases stemming from poor life choices and just plain bad luck. Florida man makes two appearances (we’ll let you guess which of the aforementioned categories he fits into).

Multiple attempts to create a cottage garden, first in Idaho and now in South Carolina, have brought disappointment. Both are challenging climates, but where others have succeeded, I’ve been left with little more than a pile of cherry tomatoes for my vast efforts (those things are bulletproof).\n\nI’d all but given up on the idea of ever successfully growing my own food — I can’t even keep those pots of herbs you buy at the grocery store alive for more than a week — until I met the Gardyn Studio 2.\n\nA smart indoor garden, the Gardyn Studio 2 is an automated growing platform that deploys AI to do what I failed to do: watch over and properly take care of my plants.\n\n8 Verge Score Gardyn Studio 2 $ 412 $ 549 25 % off $ 412 The Good Foolproof indoor gardening\n\nEasy set-up and minimal maintenance\n\nThe Kelby AI assistant is helpful\n\nSubscription includes free plants The Bad Expensive\n\nCostly monthly subscription\n\nGrow light too bright for most rooms $412 at Gardyn How we rate and review products\n\nIt works through a combination of hydroponic watering, automated lighting, a camera that captures plant images, and algorithms that analyze the plants’ growth stages and adapt. An AI assistant called Kelby, which requires a subscription, manages the light and water cycles, sends alerts when I need to intervene, and processes all the data from the Gardyn’s sensors and camera to help your plants grow.\n\nIt’s an impressive, albeit very expensive, system. In the three months I’ve had it in my home, I’ve grown a sunflower, a full kohlrabi, lots of basil, lettuce, green beans, chard, and some other tasty exotic veggies I’d never heard of. I am currently working on strawberries, cherry tomatoes, lavender, jalapeño peppers, and buttercrunch lettuce — in December, in my dining room. This is why I love technology.\n\nEveryone loves the idea of growing their own food, but few of us have the space, time, or expertise to dedicate to the task. It’s a bit like baking; it’s a lot harder than it looks.\n\nGardyn Studio 2 is designed to address these problems. It costs $549, with an optional $25 monthly subscription (or $19 a month with a two-year plan). That gets you Kelby’s assistance, new seed pods every month to keep your Gardyn growing, and discounts on plant food, among other perks.\n\nMy Gardyn started producing within 6 weeks, and I was able to cut my family of four’s weekly produce buying in half, easily covering the monthly subscription. Plus, I really enjoy that every time I go to get something from the Gardyn, it’s fresh and ready, not wilted in my fridge. I’ve also found I generate far less food waste.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 The Gardyn Studio 2, assembled and ready to grow.\n\nThe Studio 2 is Gardyn’s newest model and is a smaller version of its flagship product, the $900 Gardyn Home. The Studio has space for 16 plants (compared to 30 on the Home) and is a redesign of the first Studio, which launched in 2024. The Studio concept addresses customer feedback that the Gardyn Home produced too much produce for smaller households to keep up with, and its footprint was too large, founder and CEO FX Rouxel told me.\n\nSpecs: Gardyn Studio 2 Price : $549 (or $23/month for two years)\n\nWhat’s in the box : Gardyn Studio, 16-plant starter kit, grow guide\n\nMembership : Starting at $19 a month paid annually or $25 paid monthly (includes monthly plant refills, Kelby AI assistant in app, additional features like Vacation Mode).\n\nSize : 17”W x 12”D x 54”H, 1.4 sq ft footprint\n\nSensors : water level, humidity, and interior temperature\n\nCamera : 8MP ultra-wide camera (photos only, : 8MP ultra-wide camera (photos only, can be disabled\n\nLights : 60W full spectrum LED lights\n\nConnectivity : Wi-Fi, 2.4GHz band\n\nWarranty: 2 years\n\nThe Studio 2 uses new columns that require less maintenance, an upgraded camera with higher resolution, and a wider field of view to better monitor its charges. There is also a new sunrise/sunset lighting mode for the large 60-LED lamp that helps the garden grow.\n\nThe columns are what make Gardyn unique among indoor plant systems (none of which I’ve tried). It’s a patented vertical growing, hydroponic system that Rouxel calls “the most compact way to grow food at home.”\n\nProprietary yCube seed pods that use rockwool as a growing medium fit into the columns, which sit on a large water tank with a pump inside and an attractive wooden lid. The strip of LED lights with a camera built in sits in front of the plants, facing the wall (so it’s not going to be snapping pictures of you, only the plants, every 30 minutes).\n\nGardyn comes with straps to anchor the system to the wall, as fully grown plants could cause it to topple. A button at the bottom lets you turn the light on or off quickly, and you can also schedule it in the Gardyn app.\n\nAssembling Gardyn was straightforward and took about 20 minutes. It came with a starter kit of 16 seed pods called the Chef’s Favorites, including herbs such as thyme, basil, and lemon balm, as well as celery, collard greens, green tatsoi, spinach, salanova, and yellow chard. There was also a sunflower.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 5 The starter kit, planted in late August, was flourishing by early October.\n\nI inserted the pods using the app to determine the best position for each and sat back and let Gardyn do the rest. Other than topping up the water based on Kelby’s prompts in the app and adding some plant food, I didn’t have to do anything else until four weeks in, when I was told to clean the tank and check the roots.\n\nI am growing strawberries, cherry tomatoes, and lavender — in December, in my dining room. This is why I love technology\n\nOne challenge of Gardyn is finding a suitable spot for it. At 1.4 square feet wide and about 5 feet tall, it takes up quite a lot of space. While the kitchen would be the logical place, the light is too bright for my open plan space. You can adjust the timing of the light, but Gardyn recommends 14-16 hours of full light per day. I ended up putting it in the dining room just off the kitchen.\n\nOnce the plants started to bud, Kelby told me to trim a few to encourage stronger plants, and within a couple of weeks, I had my first harvest of young sprouts, which made for a delicious, if unusual, salad.\n\nHarvesting got more labor-intensive as things started to really grow; the green tatsoi was going like gangbusters and started blocking the light to some of the herbs. I did a bit of strategic reconfiguring of the pods, along with lots of harvesting — it was great as a bok choy substitute.\n\nI can see why people wanted a smaller Gardyn, although I think if I had more plants I used regularly, it would be a bit easier.\n\nWithin a few weeks, several plants, including the chard and celery, were really flourishing, so I decided to transplant them to my garden (we’ll see how long that lasts) and try a few new plants.\n\nI did have two pods that never sprouted, and my bull’s blood beets didn’t seem to be doing much, so I swapped them out for three new pods, including green beans, cherry tomatoes, and strawberries. (These needed to be started outside of the Gardyn as they can’t take plant food until they sprout). Those will obviously take longer to proffer their goods, although I got at least one serving of green beans within a month.\n\nIt will take some fine-tuning to determine which plant lineup works best for my needs. At this point, I’m leaning towards a combination of herbs, salad greens, cherry tomatoes, and chard. I can see that once you have a solid rotation that fits with your culinary habits, Gardyn could replace most of your fresh produce purchases.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 Harvesting needs to be done fairly frequently once the leafy greens get going.\n\nI’m also experimenting with transplanting the mature plants into my garden. However, out there, they will be at my mercy and away from the watchful eye of Kelby. I was surprised to find Gardyn’s AI assistant was very useful. It basically did what I have failed to do in my time as a master plant killer — keep an eye on and take care of the plants, roping me in to help every now and then to add water, plant food, thin the sprouts, harvest, prune roots, and other actions to encourage growth.\n\nNow, if you are more attentive and attuned to plants than I am, you could do much of this yourself, but if you are a beginner or a failure like me, Kelby feels fairly essential.\n\nRouxel explained that the AI models crunch data from temperature, humidity, and water sensors, along with images of the plants, to compute how fast the plants are growing and to optimize variables to promote healthy growth. “It’s like having a personal master gardener on your side 24/7, always monitoring what’s going on, taking action where it can, and when it cannot, it lets you know what to do,” he says.\n\nI wasn’t the only one who enjoyed growing plants indoors in the winter …\n\nIf you opt out of Kelby after the free month’s trial, you can continue to grow plants and automate the watering and lighting on a schedule that you can customize, as well as buy new yCubes directly from the Gardyn app starting at $5 a plant.\n\nI’ve enjoyed using the Gardyn, and everything I’ve grown has tasted delicious. It does require some maintenance, but far less than growing anything from scratch by myself. It remains to be seen if my plan to transplant veggies into my garden will be successful. If it is, I would be even more inclined to invest in this. But for anyone who likes the idea of having freshly grown vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs in their home, Garden really is a foolproof system.\n\nPhotos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-30T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T15:29:27.482864"}

But there’s a whole family of spiny lobsters that lack these claws. They tend to ward off predators by forming large groups that collectively can present a lot of pointy bits towards anything attempting to eat them. In fact, studies found that the lobsters can sense the presence of other species-members using molecules emitted into the water, and use that to find peers to congregate with.\n\nA new study, however, finds that this same signal may lure young lobsters to their doom, causing them to try to congregate with older lobsters that are too big to be eaten by nearby predators. The smaller lobsters thus fall victim to a phenomenon called an “ecological trap,” which has rarely been seen to occur without human intervention.\n\nLobsters vs. groupers\n\nThe study was performed in the waters off Florida, where the seafloor is dotted by what are called “solution holes.” These features are the product of lower sea levels such as those that occur during periods of expanded glaciers and ice caps.

This created an irregular array of small shallow pits and crevices, many of which have been reshaped by sea life since the area was submerged again.\n\nThe crevices offer a great gathering place for spiny lobsters, which can congregate in a way that ensures their spiky bits are all arranged to effectively block an attack from the limited directions of approach.

Investors think that period of experimentation is coming to an end.\n\nTechCrunch recently surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs and an overwhelming majority predicted enterprises will increase their budgets for AI in 2026 — but not for everything. Most investors said this budget increase will be concentrated, and that many enterprises will spend more funds on fewer contracts.\n\nAndrew Ferguson, a vice president at Databricks Ventures, predicted 2026 will be the year that enterprises start consolidating their investments and picking winners.\n\n“Today, enterprises are testing multiple tools for a single-use case, and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts],” Ferguson said. “As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools and deploy that savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.”\n\nRob Biederman, a managing partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners, agreed. He predicts that enterprise companies will not only concentrate their individual spending, the broader enterprise landscape will narrow its overall AI spending to only a handful of vendors across the entire industry.\n\n“Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else,” Biederman said. “We expect a bifurcation where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.”\n\nFocused investments\n\nScott Beechuk, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners, thinks enterprises will increase their spending on the tools that make AI safe for enterprises to use.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

What’s not clear, is how.\n\nIt’s possible that AI startups will reach the same reckoning point that SaaS startups arrived at a few years ago.\n\nThe companies operating hard-to-replicate products such as vertical solutions or those built on proprietary data, will likely still be able to grow. Startups with products similar to those offered by large enterprise suppliers like AWS or Salesforce, may start to see pilot projects and funding dry up.\n\nInvestors see this possibility too.

Dictation apps have been around for years, but in the past they’ve proved slow and inaccurate — unless you speak with particular accents and enunciate clearly.\n\nBut advances in large language models (LLMs) and speech-to-text models have helped improve the systems that can decipher speech better while retaining the context to format the text. And developers have built in features to automatically format text, remove filler words, and ignore fumbles to output text that would need fewer edits.\n\nBut with the soaring popularity of everything AI, there’s dozens of such apps on the market. So we’ve collated our pick of the best and most useful dictation apps his year.\n\nWispr Flow is a well-funded AI dictation app that lets you add custom words and instructions for dictation. It has native apps for MacOS, Windows and iOS, and an Android version is in the works.\n\nThe app lets you customize how its system transcribes your notes by letting you choose from “formal,” “casual,” and “very casual” styles for different kinds of writing, such as personal messaging, work, and email. And if you use it with vibe coding tools like Cursor, you can turn on a feature to automatically recognize variables or tag files in the chat.\n\nThe app lets you note down up to 2,000 words per month for free on any of the desktop versions, and 1,000 words per month on iOS. Its subscription plans offer unlimited transcription, and start at $15 per month.\n\nImage Credits: Wispr Flow Image Credits:Wispr Flow\n\nWillow advertises itself as a big time-saver for those who don’t like to type. Alongside common features like automatic editing and formatting, the app has a feature that taps large language models to generate a full chunk of text from just a few dictated words.\n\nWillow also takes a more privacy-focused stab at AI-assisted note-taking by storing all transcripts locally on your device, and lets you opt out of model training as well. It also lets you add custom vocabulary to the app to help it adapt to your industry’s parlance, or your local dialect.\n\nImage Credits: WIllow Image Credits:Willow\n\nWillow lets you dictate 2,000 words per month on its desktop app for free. Individual subscription plans start at $15 per month, giving you unlimited dictation and enabling the app to remember your writing style.\n\nIf you are focused on privacy, Monologue lets you download its model so you can run it on your device for transcriptions and avoid sending data to the cloud. What’s more, the app lets you customize its tone of voice according to the apps you use it with.\n\nMonologue lets you jot down 1,000 words per month for free, and its subscription costs $10 per month, or $100 per year. And if you end up becoming one of the app’s top users, the company will also send you this funky Monokey to use with the app.\n\nKeyboards are so 1983.\n\n\n\nYou only need one key—Monokey, the limited edition device that turns your voice into text in Monologue.\n\n\n\nWe're giving away 10, along with a free annual subscription to Monologue. pic.twitter.com/nXuz1ll2LU — Monologue (@usemonologue) November 18, 2025\n\nSuperwhisper is primarily a dictation app, but it can also transcribe from audio or video files. The app gives you the freedom to choose and download AI models, including its own models that have different speeds and accuracy, along with NVIDIA’s Parakeet speech recognition models.\n\nThe app also lets you write custom prompts to steer the output. You can easily see both processed and unprocessed transcripts that are integrated with the system keyboard.\n\nThe basic voice-to-text feature is free to use, and you get 15 minutes to test out Pro features such as translation and transcription. The paid tier lets you use your own AI API keys and plug in cloud and local models without any caps.\n\nThe monthly plan costs $8.49 per month, the annual plan costs $84.99 per month, or you can pay $249.99 for a lifetime subscription.\n\nThis app takes an offline-first, no-subscription approach, letting you use local models for transcription. There’s also a GitHub repository for those who want to host and run the open-source version themselves. VoiceTypr supports over 99 languages and works on both Mac and Windows.\n\nVoiceTypr is available to try for three days for free, and after that it will allow you to buy a lifetime license. The app costs $35 for one device, $56 for two, and $98 for four devices.\n\nAqua is another Y-Combinator-backed voice typing client for Windows and MacOS that claims to be one of the fastest tools in the category in terms of latency.\n\nBesides handling grammar and punctuation, Aqua also lets you autofill text by saying phrases — you can say “my address” and have Aqua type in your address, for example.\n\nThe app also offers its own speech-to-text API for other apps.\n\nThe free tier gets you 1,000 words per month. The paid plans start from $8 per month (annual billing), and unlock unlimited words and 800 custom dictionary values.\n\nHandy is an open-source and free transcription tool that can run on Mac, Windows, and Linux. The application is pretty basic and doesn’t offer a lot of customization, but if you are trying to get started with using your voice more and don’t want to pay, it is a good option.\n\nThe app has a basic settings menu that lets you toggle push-to-talk, and change the hotkey to activate the transcription.\n\nTypeless is another app in this category with a high free word count. The company claims that it doesn’t retain any data or use it to train models. Typeless also suggests a better version of the sentence if you might have fumbled a line.\n\nThe app lets you dictate up to 4,000 words per week (roughly 16,000 words per month) on its free tier. You can pay $12 per month (billed annually) to unlock unlimited words and get access to new features.

Instead of tanking, venture bets in the sector remained essentially flat relative to 2024, according to CTVC, far from the slide some had expected.\n\nThat resiliency is due in part to continued threat of climate change. Perhaps a bigger contributing factor is that many climate technologies have become either cheaper or better than the fossil fuel alternatives — or are on the cusp of being so.\n\nThe incredible cost reductions of solar, wind, and batteries continue to fill climate tech’s sails.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\n“They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026,” Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures, told TechCrunch.\n\n“I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates,” Po Bronson, managing director at SOSV’s IndieBio, told TechCrunch.\n\nIn 2025, data centers were obsessed with securing new sources of power. But Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures, thinks they’ll adjust their focus for 2026. “The 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid,” she said. Decoupling could solve some challenges that data centers face, namely in resistance from grid operators and the public, who are increasingly worried that the new loads are driving up their electricity prices.\n\nThere will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefitted from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures.\n\nInvestors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.\n\n“Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,” said Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health. But it’s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. “The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.”\n\nAndrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. “We still need a LOT more power, and we’ll use that — no build-out bubble there…yet.”\n\nOutside of AI and data centers, Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partners, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. “We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,” he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.\n\nThe continuing quest for power\n\nThanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In the last few weeks, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.\n\n“Nuclear everything is in vogue right now,” Teamey said.\n\nBut it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to solar and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing record-setting deployments in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.\n\n“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said Leo Banchik, director at Voyager. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”\n\nSeveral investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026.\n\n“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There’s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they’re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.”\n\nAnd while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”\n\nWhich startup is most likely to go public in 2026?\n\nNot everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC.\n\nThe name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that recently raised a $462 million round. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector, and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.\n\nTrends to watch\n\nBeyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.\n\n“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”\n\nResiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.\n\nBeebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”\n\nAI, of course, is likely to play a roll in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers.” said Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”\n\nBut it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.\n\nDive deeper\n\nBelow are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch’s survey, listed in alphabetical order. Click the link to jump to a specific response.\n\nAnil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partner\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nReindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.\n\nAnother area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8 Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven’t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nGas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries — particularly sodium-ion — represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.\n\nIn addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nFervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nSodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nOne emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.\n\nDistributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.\n\nLeo Banchik, director at Voyager\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nData centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we’re unlikely to see much stranded capacity — as compute gets cheaper and more available, we’ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources — firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality — rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.\n\nFission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we’re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.\n\nNatural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too — using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nSolar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we’ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There’s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\n\nMost likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multi-billion dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nEnergy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.\n\nIndustrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.\n\nWe’ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects — lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling — maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nSoftware and AI enabling physical infrastructure: Real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.\n\nCompanies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies – a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn’t before.\n\nLastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.\n\nAndrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nData centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual-reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we’ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that — no build-out bubble there…yet.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nFor power generation: Geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term. For actual siting: The above technologies can be sited anywhere, but mainly western states for geothermal. For batteries — PJM [the grid that covers the Midatlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nVenture-backed: Fervo\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nGeothermal and grid scale batteries.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nGrid software and EV trucking. One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.\n\nPo Bronson, managing director at SOSV’s IndieBio\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nI’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from “picks and shovels” companies who don’t want to get commoditized so they’re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that’s purchased.\n\nA related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nI don’t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That’s my closest. I don’t want to opine on other VC’s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn’t open my mouth where I’m only partially informed.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nFor larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nOn what to pay more attention to, I’ll toot Duncan’s horn here again — what he’s doing with the Plasma Forge is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night.\n\nOne last note is my consistent feeling that it’s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo!, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek.\n\nI do feel like that’s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this to AgFunder recently, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there’s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don’t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn’t win, just one company wins.\n\nTom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nThere will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nBudgets for hyperscalers are in the $50-100B range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nIPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don’t telegraph exactly when they will go public.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nFolks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae also at an interesting point.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nWe’ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren’t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.\n\nLisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nIn our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nWe believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\n\nWe anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nChallenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nOur team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.\n\nAmy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nMy prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nOne opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it’s in the early stages.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy…!\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nLong duration energy storage technology companies which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We’re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nWe should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.\n\nDaniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nWe expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following:\n\nstructured power off take agreements with a mix of behind-the-meter and utility-related infrastructure to bring optimization around pricing and reliability; more action at the federal, ISO/RTO, and state level to accelerate deployment of energy assets while balancing tariff structures that avoid burdening voting consumers with increased costs; M&A in the technology optimization area, including resources such as geothermal, nuclear, critical minerals and downstream hardware and software products enabling the digitalization, decarbonization and distribution of energy supplies and load management, a key area of our focus and that which venture capital in general is quite focused on.\n\nWhile we don’t expect an overall “bust cycle” for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nThe greatest near-term opportunity — and challenge — lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources — probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected.\n\nWe expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nFactorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets).\n\nWatch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals.\n\nBeyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nProjects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds.\n\nIn 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nFor western markets to compete with China’s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025.\n\nTo increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack — early stage venture, growth stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase.\n\nWe see opportunities to use risk sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g. hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures’ spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.\n\nWe should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small start-ups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more.\n\nWe are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.\n\nLaurie Menoud, At One Ventures\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nYes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn’t a startup timeline. It’s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.\n\nRelated to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nIn places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the US alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that’s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location.\n\nThe same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nNo one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I’d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the US.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nRelectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It’s happening now.\n\nAnd overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can’t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today.\n\nBattery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn’t that a big win?\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nCompanies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It’s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% – 45% of the world’s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It’s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like.\n\nJoshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nPush for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of “bring your own generation” and “demand flexibility.”\n\nThe age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.\n\nThe unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: these will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.\n\nData centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads -— the more tech they adopt, the faster they’ll get connected.\n\nWe’ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We’ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nNuclear fusion! I think we’ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e. deuterium fusion where it would be Q>1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.\n\nGeothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\n\nSPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nGeothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nRobotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.\n\nLogistics and Manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, on-shoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long term certainty on lower costs vs conventional fuels for example, and you’ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.\n\nResilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.\n\nMatt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nData centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America’s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nThe call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It’s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants.\n\nIf enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America’s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.\n\nThere’s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and big tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector.\n\nBy enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That’s why this isn’t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nMill. We’ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. e’re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.\n\nRobotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nWe will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We’ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.\n\nKyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health\n\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\n\nI think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I’m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle — it’s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it’s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.\n\nThe spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It’s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You’d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That’s pretty hard to do.\n\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\n\nThis has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it’s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It’s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations — the list goes on and on and on.\n\nA bull market in electricity like this, I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it’s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We’ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it’s fair to to think that there will be.\n\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely IPO in 2026?\n\nI think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We’ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we’ll definitely see some of those. And you’ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It’s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.\n\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\n\nNuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly.\n\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\n\nThere haven’t been any technologies I’ve seen recently where I’m like, ‘Oh wow that’s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.’ I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it’s an amazing opportunity.\n\nIf you look at the the various trends, it’s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there’s demand for it.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T17:00:45.031169"}

Its new OneXSugar Wallet is reminiscent of the company’s folding OneXSugar Sugar 1 handheld that launched earlier this year. But instead of two screens, the Wallet handheld unfolds to reveal just one big 8.01-inch OLED screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, as spotted by Retro Handhelds.\n\nThe OneXSugar Wallet was announced on China’s Weibo yesterday, but with few details about its features and capabilities. That folding OLED screen has a resolution of 2,480x1,860 pixels, and the handheld will be powered by an unspecified “Qualcomm gaming platform flagship processor,” but its performance and emulation capabilities are unknown.\n\nThe OneXSugar Wallet is smaller when folded shut, but you’re going to need deep pockets to carry it around.

There are also shoulder buttons and triggers on the back of the handheld, and a pair of front-facing speakers flanking the top half of the screen. The biggest question is how much will the handheld cost?. There are already $1,000 handheld consoles, but folding screen devices like the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 are priced closer to $2,000.

The Department of Justice announced the guilty pleas on Tuesday, saying 40-year-old Ryan Goldberg and 36-year-old Kevin Martin extorted $1.2 million in Bitcoin from a medical device company and targeted several others.\n\nGoldberg, Martin, and an unnamed co-conspirator were indicted for the attacks in October, which involved using ALPHV / BlackCat ransomware to encrypt and steal data from their victims. As reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, Martin and the third conspirator worked as ransomware negotiators at Digital Mint, a cybercrime and incident response company, while Goldberg was an incident response manager at Sygnia Cybersecurity Services.\n\nALPHV / BlackCat is a hacker group that uses a ransomware-as-a-service model, with the developers who maintain the malware often taking a cut of stolen funds from the cybercriminals who use it to target victims. In 2023, the FBI developed a decryption tool designed to recover data from victims of ALPHV / BlackCat, which has been linked to high-profile attacks on companies like Bandai Namco, MGM Resorts, Reddit, and UnitedHealth Group.\n\nThe DOJ’s indictment claims Goldberg, Martin, and the co-conspirator used the ransomware in an attempt to extort millions of dollars from victims throughout the US, including a pharmaceutical company, a doctor’s office, an engineering company, and a drone manufacturer.\n\n“These defendants used their sophisticated cybersecurity training and experience to commit ransomware attacks — the very type of crime that they should have been working to stop,” Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva of the DOJ’s Criminal Division says in a statement. “The Department of Justice is committed to using all tools available to identify and arrest perpetrators of ransomware attacks wherever we have jurisdiction.”\n\nGoldberg and Martin pleaded guilty to one count of “conspiracy to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by extortion.” Their sentencing is scheduled for March 12th, 2026, where they’ll face up to 20 years in prison.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-30T13:32:27-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T18:39:43.120806"}

Now, academic spinouts have consolidated into a solid startup funnel worth $398 billion — and VC money is following.\n\nAccording to Dealroom’s European Spinout Report 2025, 76 of these deep tech and life sciences companies have either reached $1 billion valuations, $100 million in revenue, or both. These include unicorns like Iceye, IQM, Isar Aerospace, Synthesia, and Tekever, which are now inspiring more funds to back university spinouts.\n\nJust this month, two new funds emerged that will bring more funding to talent emerging out of European tech universities, while adding breadth to a pipeline currently topped by Cambridge, Oxford, and ETH Zurich.\n\nPSV Hafnium, out of Denmark, recently closed its inaugural fund at an oversubscribed €60 million (approximately $71 million), with a focus on Nordic deep tech. With offices in Berlin and London, but also in Aachen, U2V (University2Ventures) is targeting the same amount for its first fund, of which it recently completed the first closing.\n\nThese two newcomers join the growing ranks of European venture firms that have university spinouts as a core part of their investment thesis. Pioneered by the likes of Cambridge Innovation Capital and Oxford Science Enterprises, which have now fully matured, this category has also diversified.\n\nWhile it still mostly consists of funds backed by one or several universities and institutes, it now includes independent firms that simply see spinouts as potential fund returners — and rightly so. Oxford Ionics, acquired by U.S.-based IonQ, was one of the six spinouts out of Switzerland, the U.K., and Germany that delivered exits of more than $1 billion to their investors in 2025.\n\nThese exits come alongside increased amounts of funding. According to Dealroom, European university spinouts in deep tech and life sciences are on track to raise a near all-time-high $9.1 billion in 2025. This contrasts with overall VC funding in Europe, which is down nearly 50% from its 2021 peak.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nLarge rounds closed in 2025 also reflect appetite for spinouts in sectors as varied as nuclear energy — Proxima Fusion — and dual-use drones — Quantum Systems, now valued above $3 billion. In many cases, these startups leverage research from specialized labs, which also explains why there is a long tail of European locations capable of producing spinouts.\n\nBuilding relationships with hubs outside of Oxbridge and leading countries can also be a way for newcomers to differentiate themselves and find deals. “The Nordic’s research institutions hold extraordinary, untapped potential,” PSV Hafnium’s partners stated in a press release.\n\nPSV Hafnium itself is a spinout from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but is also making early-stage investments in other Nordic countries. One of its nine checks to date went to SisuSemi, a Finnish startup leveraging a decade of research at the University of Turku to bring new surface cleaning tech to the semiconductor industry.\n\nIt is good news for teams like SisuSemi that there is more funding available to them. It also comes in addition to grants, commercialization support, and improved deal terms that contribute to an encouraging environment for Europe’s spinouts. However, one pain point remains: growth capital.\n\nAs the report’s authors note, this gap “is not a unique trend to spinouts, but something impacting the entire startup ecosystem in Europe.” Still, it is quite striking that nearly 50% of late-stage funding for European deep tech and life sciences spinouts comes from outside Europe, mainly from the U.S.\n\nWhile this share has decreased over the years, Europe won’t be fully reaping the benefits of its investments in talent and research unless this changes more substantially — but that’s a broader issue to be solved.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T18:39:43.519671"}

But the new homeowner didn’t do so well either when storms hit, and in 2015, the property was sold one final time: to a state-run program that buys and demolishes houses in flood zones and permanently restores the property to open space.\n\n“It’s pretty traumatic to watch your childhood home be bulldozed,” said Onderko, 64 and now the mayor of this 2.5-square-mile borough, which sits at the confluence of two rivers and a placid-looking brook that turns into a raging river when a storm moves through.\n\nBlue Acres\n\nHis boyhood property—now just a grass lot—is one of some 1,200 properties that have been acquired across New Jersey by the state’s Blue Acres program, which has used more than $234 million in federal and state funds to pay fair market value to homeowners in flood-prone areas who, like the Onderko family, had grown weary of getting flooded over and over again.\n\nCredit: Bobby Bank Flooding in Manville following a Nor’Easter in 2007\n\nThe program, started in 1995, is considered a national model as buyouts are an increasingly important tool for dealing with climate-related flooding.

The Bay Area firm has largely operated under the radar despite managing roughly $6 billion across 12 core seed funds and four “select,” opportunity-style funds that it has used to pour more capital into portfolio companies that are gaining momentum. While other VCs have grown more promotional – building personal brands on social media and podcasts to attract founders and deal flow – True has gone in the opposite direction, quietly cultivating a tight network of repeat founders. The strategy seems to be working: according to Callaghan, the firm boasts 63 exits with gains and seven IPOs amid a portfolio of some 300 companies assembled over its 20-year history.\n\nThree of True’s four recent exits in the fourth quarter of 2025 involved repeat founders who came back to work with the firm again after previous successes, says Callaghan. Still, it’s Callaghan’s thinking about the future of human-computer interaction that really stands out in a sea of AI hype and mega-rounds.\n\n“We’re not going to be using iPhones in 10 years,” Callaghan says flatly. “I kind of don’t think we’ll be using them in five years – or let’s say something different that’s a little safer – we’re going to be using them in very different ways.”\n\nHis argument is simple: our phones are lousy at being the interface between humans and intelligence. “The way we take them out right now to send a text to confirm this or send you some message or write an email – [that’s] super inefficient, [and] not a great interface,” he explains. “[They’re] prone to error, prone to disruption [of] our normal lives.”\n\nSo sure is he of this that True has been spending years exploring alternative interfaces – software-based, hardware-based, everything in between. It’s the same instinct that led True to bet early on Fitbit before wearables were obvious, to invest in Peloton after hundreds of other VCs said ‘no thanks,’ and to back Ring when founder Jamie Siminoff kept running out of money and even the judges on “Shark Tank” turned him away. Each time, the bet looked questionable, says Callaghan. Each time, the bet was on a new way for humans to interact with technology that felt more natural than what came before.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nThe latest manifestation of this thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device that Callaghan describes as a “thought companion” — or, in more mundane terms, a voice-activated ring worn on the index finger. Its singular purpose: capturing and organizing your thoughts through voice notes. It’s not trying to be another Humane AI Pin or compete with Oura’s health tracking. “It does one thing really well,” Callaghan says. “But that one thing is a fundamental human behavioral need that is missing from technology today.”\n\nThe idea isn’t to passively record ambient audio but to be there when an idea strikes, serving as a kind of thought partner. It’s attached to an app, leverages AI, and, according to Callaghan, represents a very different philosophy about how we should interact with intelligence.\n\nWhat drew True to Sandbar founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong wasn’t just the product, though. “When we met Mina, we were just absolutely aligned on vision,” Callaghan recalls. True’s team had already been thinking for years about alternative interfaces, making targeted investments around that possibility. They’d met with dozens of founders, as a result. But the approach of Fahmi and Hong – who previously worked together on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, a startup acquired by Meta in 2019 – stood out. “It’s about what [the ring] enables. It’s about the behavior it enables that we will very soon realize we can’t live without.”\n\nThere’s an echo here of Callaghan’s old line about Peloton: “It’s not about the bike.” To some, the bike – even its earliest iteration – was compelling. But Peloton was really about the behavior it enabled and the community it created; the bike was just the vessel.\n\nThis philosophy of betting on new behaviors — not just new gadgets — also explains how True has managed to stay disciplined about capital. Even as AI startups raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations out of the gate, True insists that it’s able to stick to what it does best, which is to write seed checks of $3 million to $6 million for 15% to 20% ownership in startups that it often gets to see first.\n\nCallaghan says True will raise more money to fund what’s working, but he’s not interested in raising billions of dollars. “Like, why? You don’t need that to build something amazing today.”\n\nThat same measured approach colors his view of the broader AI boom. While he says (when asked) that he believes OpenAI could soon be worth a trillion dollars, and while he calls this the most powerful compute wave we’ve seen, Callaghan sees warning signs in the circular financing deals backing hyperscalers and their $5 trillion in projected CapEx spending on data centers and chips. “We’re in a very capital intense part of the cycle, and that is worrisome,” he notes.\n\nThat said, he’s optimistic about where the real opportunities lie. Callaghan thinks the greatest value creation is ahead of us – not in the infrastructure layer but in the application layer, where new interfaces will enable entirely new behaviors.\n\nIt all comes back to his core investing philosophy, which sounds almost romantic — the kind of pitch-perfect VC wisdom that would ring hollow from most people: “It should be scary and lonely and you should be called crazy,” Callaghan says about early-stage investing done right. “And it should be really blurry and ambiguous, but you should be with a team that you really believe in.” Five to ten years later, he says, you’ll know if you were on to something.\n\nEither way, based on True’s track record of betting on hardware that many others missed – fitness trackers, connected bikes, smart doorbells, and now thought-capturing rings – it’s worth paying attention when Callaghan says the phone’s days are numbered. Being early is the whole point — and the trend lines support his thesis: the smartphone market is effectively saturated, growing at barely 2% annually, while wearables — smartwatches, rings, and voice-enabled devices — are expanding at double-digit rates.\n\nSomething’s shifting in how we want to interact with technology, and True is placing its bets accordingly.\n\nPictured above, Sandbar’s Stream ring.

Get up to 14% off plans for three months, including Starter, Standard, and Plus tiers.", "content": "Google Workspace is the modern business world’s de facto productivity suite, and it’s only gotten better over the years. There’s the centralization of Google Docs, Drive, and Gmail, of course, but Google has bolstered its productivity suite with an AI infusion via Gemini, as well as simplified its offerings to work for massive corporations all the way down to individual users. If you want to get the best price, you need a Google Workspace promo code.\n\nThankfully, you’ve landed in the right spot. Google is offering Workspace discounts until the end of 2026, allowing you to save up to 14 percent on a plan for your first three months. You just need to use one of the coupon codes linked above. Google Workspace works for both individual users and businesses, but if you’re just looking for more Drive space and a few extra features, take a look at Google One.\n\nSave up to 14% Off These Google Workspace Promo Codes 2026\n\nThere are some notable differences between each Workspace plan – I’ll dig into them in the next section – but all three plans come with access to the full slate of Workspace apps. You get Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Meet, of course, but even the cheapest Starter plan includes basic access to Google’s other apps, such as NotebookLM and Gemini inside the Workspace suite.\n\nIf you want to save, make sure to click one of the promo codes at the top of this page to secure your discount.\n\nWhat Is the Best Google Workspace Plan?\n\nGoogle offers four different Workspace plans, though only three are relevant for most people. There’s Starter, Standard, and Plus, as well as Enterprise, which is only available if you contact Google’s sales team. There isn’t a minimum number of users on any of the plans, but the bottom three options (Starter, Standard, and Plus) support up to 300 users. If you need more than that, you’ll need an Enterprise plan.\n\nAlthough you have access to all the apps regardless of the plan you choose, there are some important differences, particularly between the Starter and Standard plans. Both include secure storage through Google Drive, but Starter comes with 30GB per user while Standard comes with a massive 2TB per user. Plus bumps that up to 5TB per user. Across all plans, storage is in a shared pool, so each additional user adds to the total pool of storage your organization can use.\n\nGemini is also a big difference between Starter and Standard.

That must change.", "content": "In 2025, American and world leaders were preoccupied with wars in the Middle East. Most dramatically, first Israel and the United States bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities. Some commentators feared that President Trump’s decision to bomb Iran would drag the United States into the “forever wars” in the Middle East that presidential candidate Trump had pledged to avoid. The tragic war in Gaza had become a humanitarian disaster. After years of promising to reduce engagement with the region from Democratic and Republican presidents alike, it appeared that the US was being dragged back into Middle East once again.\n\nI hope that’s not the case. Instead, in 2026, President Trump, his administration, the US Congress, and the American people more generally must realize that the real challenges to the American national interests, the free world, and global order more generally come not from the Middle East but from the autocratic China and Russia. The three-decade honeymoon from great power politics after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War is over. For the United States to succeed in this new era of great power competition, US strategists must first accurately diagnose the threat and then devise and implement effective prescriptions.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.\n\nThe oversimplified assessment is that we have entered a new Cold War with Xi’s China and his sidekick, Russian leader Vladimir Putin. To be sure, there are some parallels between our current era of great power competition and the Cold War. The balance of power in the world today is dominated by two great powers, the United States and China, much like the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the world during the Cold War. Second, like the contest between communism and capitalism during the last century, there is an ideological conflict between the great powers today. The United States is a democracy. China and Russia are autocracies. Third, at least until the second Trump era, all three of these great powers have sought to propagate and expand their influence globally. That too was the case during the last Cold War.\n\nAt the same time, there are also some significant differences. Superimposing the Cold War metaphor to explain everything regarding the US-China rivalry today distorts as much as it illuminates.\n\nFirst, while the world is dominated by two great powers, the United States remains more powerful than China on many dimensions of power—military, economic, ideological—and especially so when allies are added to the equation. Also different from the Cold War, several mid-level powers have emerged in the global system—Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa, among others—that are not willing to join exclusively the American bloc or the Chinese bloc.\n\nSecond, while the ideological dimension of great power competition is real, it is not as intense as the Cold War. The Soviets aimed to spread communism worldwide, including in Europe and the United States. They were willing to deploy the Red Army, provide military and economic assistance, overthrow regimes, and fight proxy wars with the United States to achieve that aim. So far, Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China have not employed these same aggressive methods to export their model of governance or construct an alternative world order. Putin is much more aggressive in propagating his ideology of illiberal nationalism and seeking to destroy the liberal international order. Thankfully, however, Russia does not have the capabilities of China to succeed in these revisionist aims.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T10:28:28.663621"}

The rush of dopamine. The sexual subtlety and subtext of everything not said. Flirting, to me, remains one of the last human endeavors where people are intentionally trying to find common ground. It’s pure possibility, absolute magnetism. It’s also an art that can’t be faked, or—despite Silicon Valley’s best attempts—perfected by AI.\n\nThat, of course, didn’t stop Big Dating from going all in on virtual intimacy this year, during which the focus shifted from endless swipes to AI-powered matchmaking. As the narrative around dating fatigue reached new heights, the trend toward sincere connection was an overdue correction by an industry that, across the last decade, built itself on ruthless scale, maniacal ambition, and profit incentives, only to realize that the answer was right in front of them all along: You win by investing in people.\n\nThe integration of AI tools wasn’t simply about keeping up with the Joneses or leaning into new innovations (though it was some of that).

It led many companies to reconsider their user experience. According to a Pew Research Center study a few years ago, in the US, almost 60 percent of single adults said they were not currently looking for a relationship or casual dates. And while we aren’t exactly in a romantic recession—active users remain high; not to mention that Facebook Dating is a secret hit among Gen Z—overall user engagement among several apps, according to analytics firm Apptopia, has decreased by 7 percent year-over-year. (Yes, even in spite of one Belgian artist’s bizarre attempt to match people based on their browser history.)\n\nIt’s not a crisis or anything of the sort—hundreds of millions of people still swipe, scroll, and like on a daily basis—Big Dating just desperately needed to repair its reputation. AI looked like an answer.\n\nIn October, Three Day Rule, the veteran matchmaking service, launched a matchmaker-trained AI app called Tai that offers real-time coaching. Grindr, which is on a quest to become the ultimate global gayborhood by going “AI native,” is using tools from Anthropic and Amazon on its wingman feature and chat summaries (though some users weren’t happy about the app’s broad embrace of machine tech). Iris, Rizz, and Elate also rolled out AI features to help users navigate the early talking stages.\n\nIn a year where everyone had Love Island USA on the brain, yearners made a comeback, right-wing influencers campaigned for a larger stake in the dating zeitgeist, and virtual relationships saw record growth—as anecdotally did divorces caused by AI affairs. (According to a report by TechCrunch, the AI companion market has grown more than 96 percent since 2024.) Tinder, meanwhile, underwent a brand refresh and tried to attract more Gen Z users. “The biggest issue that we’re concerned with … is the bulk creation of new accounts,” Yoel Roth, head of trust and safety for Match Group, told WIRED in October following the launch of Tinder’s mandatory face verification update.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T11:24:25.032993"}

With so many agencies and offices that needed upgrading, it was slow going. But as repeated government data breaches drew urgent attention to the issue, and as the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency—founded in 2018—established itself during the early 2020s, minimum standards seemed to be rising. Now, with major staffing cuts at CISA and in other key departments across the government, that incremental progress could quickly erode.\n\n“We’ve spent a lot of time trying to encourage the government to do more, and CISA was doing, you know, a better job,” retiring comptroller general Gene Dodaro told the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on December 16. He added that the Government Accountability Office has “a lot of open recommendations still for them to do. But I’m concerned that we’re taking our foot off the gas at CISA, and I think we’ll live to regret it.”\n\nCISA lost about 1,000 people, more than a third of its staff, as a result of cuts that seemed to be motivated by the Trump administration’s anger about the agency’s election security work. Cybersecurity Dive reported in mid-November that the agency is planning to rebuild in 2026.\n\n“The recent reduction in personnel has limited CISA’s ability to fully support national security imperatives and administration priorities,” acting CISA director Madhu Gottumukkala wrote in a memo to staff at the beginning of November. He added that that agency has “reached a pivotal moment” but is “hampered by an approximately 40 percent vacancy rate across key mission areas.”\n\nWhen asked for comment about staffing cuts at CISA and the administration’s plans for maintaining and improving federal cybersecurity and critical infrastructure defenses, the White House referred WIRED to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nCISA director of public affairs Marci McCarthy told WIRED in a statement that the agency is focused on executing its statutory mission. “Claims that staffing adjustments are weakening cybersecurity miss the truth,” she said in the statement. “We are accelerating innovation, deepening operational collaboration, and directing resources where they yield the greatest return.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T11:24:25.249001"}

I was afraid, then maybe a little motivated?", "content": "I will admit to being afraid of scales—the kind that weigh you, not the ones on a snake. And so my first reaction to the idea I'd be getting a free body-scanning scale with a Factor prepared meal kit subscription was something akin to “Oh no!”\n\nIt's always bad or shameful news, I figured, and maybe nothing I don't already know. Though, as it turned out, I was wrong on both points.\n\nFactor is, of course, the prepared meal brand from meal kit giant HelloFresh, which I've tested while reviewing dozens of meal kits this past year. Think delivery TV dinners, but actually fresh and never frozen. Factor meals are meant to be microwaved, but I found when I reviewed Factor last year that the meals actually tasted much better if you air-fry them (ideally using a Ninja Crispi, the best reheating device I know).\n\nEspecially, Factor excels at the low-carb and protein-rich diet that has become equally fashionable among people who want to lose weight and people who like to lift it. Hence, this scale. Factor would like you to be able to track your progress in gaining muscle mass, losing fat, or both. And then presumably keep using Factor to make your fitness or wellness goals.\n\nWhile your first week of Factor comes at a discount right now, regular-price meals will be $14 to $15 a serving, plus $11 shipping per box. That's less than most restaurant delivery, but certainly more than if you were whipping up these meals yourself.\n\nIf you subscribe between now and the end of March, the third Factor meal box will come with a free Withings Body Comp scale, which generally retails north of $200. The Withings doesn't just weigh you. It scans your proportions of fat and bone and muscle, and indirectly measures stress levels and the elasticity of your blood vessels. It is, in fact, WIRED's favorite smart scale, something like a fitness watch for your feet.\n\nAnyway, to get the deal, use the code CONWITHINGS on Factor's website, or follow the promo code link below.\n\nIs It My Body\n\nThe scale that comes with the Factor subscription is about as fancy as it gets: a $200 Body Comp scale from high-tech fitness monitoring company Withings. The scale uses bioelectrical impedance analysis and some other proprietary methods in order to measure not just your weight but your body fat percentage, your lean muscle mass, your visceral fat, and your bone and water mass, your pulse rate, and even the stiffness of your arteries.\n\nTo get all this information, all you really need to do is stand on the scale for a few minutes. The scale will recognize you based on your weight (you'll need to be accurate in describing yourself when you set up your profile for this to work), and then cycle through a series of measurements before giving you a cheery weather report for the day.\n\nYour electrodermal activity—the “skin response via sweat gland stimulation in your feet\"—provides a gauge of stress, or at least excitation. The Withings also purports to measure your arterial age, or stiffness, via the velocity of your blood with each heartbeat. This sounds esoteric, but it has some scientific backing.\n\nNote that many physicians caution against taking indirect measurements of body composition as gospel. Other physicians counter that previous “gold standard” measurements aren't perfectly accurate, either. It's a big ol’ debate. For myself, I tend to take smart-scale measurements as a convenient way to track progress, and also a good home indicator for when there's a problem that may require attention from a physician.\n\nAnd so of course, I was petrified.

I'd still encourage others to try since bodies react differently to the active ingredients in these over-the-counter sleep aids.\n\nRebalance Dream Sleep Mints (Melatonin-Free; 31-Pack) for $46: These melatonin-free mints are designed to slowly dissolve, with natural sleep inducing ingredients like L-theanine, L-tryptophan, GABA, and slow release Reishi mushroom. You can take up to three lozenges every night, and it took me three to feel any sort of calming effects. I like the idea of a slow melting mint alternative, but I'm currently testing the version with melatonin to see how it stacks up against the melatonin-free version.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nOlly Sleep Gummy for $17: Olly is a super trendy brand whose gummy supplements consistently go viral on social media like TikTok and sell out fast. These are tasty: blackberry flavored with a hint of mint, and they contain 3 milligrams of melatonin; L-theanine, which eases anxiety and promotes a healthy sleep cycle; and botanicals like chamomile, passionflower, and lemon balm extract. (Melatonin is generally considered safe for pregnant people, but a doctor should be consulted.) The first time I took these gummies, I felt the effects and fell asleep easily. I woke up around 2 am and took two more and eventually got back to bed. The next night, after taking two I didn’t feel the sleepy effects as strongly and doubled the dose to four gummies (6 milligrams) and fell asleep after an hour or so but again woke up in the middle of the night and took more. With so many people (both on the internet and in my real life) swearing by these Olly sleep gummies, I expected more.\n\nKona Sea Salt Deep Ocean Magnesium Water Drops for $12: Kona's line of sleep and relaxation products use Magnesium from deep ocean waters in Hawai'i to support improved sleep and muscle relaxation. I tried a whole host of Kona Sea Salt's Hawaiian water products, including Calm Mineral Spa Bath ($8) and Deep Ocean Magnesium Mist ($18), but I found the drops to be most effective, although I still regularly spray the Magnesium mist before bed. You just need to put one drop per one ounce of drinking water, and it quickly absorbs into the body, with a host of supposed benefits like regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and promoting deeper sleep without a hangover. It doesn't really taste like anything except a slight salt taste, but it didn't deliver solid, consistent sleepy results like other picks above.\n\nOsea Vagus Nerve Pillow Mist for $38: This spray aims to create a calming atmosphere to help regulate and prepare the mind and body before bed. The longest cranial nerve in the body, the vagus nerve activates the body's relaxation response to help regulate stress. Each spray of this mist gives a hearty spritz of a soothing essential oil blend of juniper berry, lavender, lemon tea tree, chamomile, and Moroccan rosemary to help relax the mind and body. The smell is almost hard to describe—it’s light, with slight herbal and citrus notes that made me want to douse all of my pillows and bed linens. It may have been a placebo effect, but this triggered something in me that made me feel like I was in a spa, and I always felt noticeably more relaxed, cozier, and ready for bed.\n\nNot Effective (for Me)\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nEarthing Pillow Cover for $140: I'm so confused by this product. The pillowcase is supposed to serve as a sort of conduit for Earth's natural electrons, which give you a burst of negative charges to keep you “grounded” while sleeping and thus lead to more restful sleep. According to Earthing's website this electron grounding is supposed to “rejuvenate, reduce inflammation,” and help you “reconnect with the earth.” In actuality, it's a synthetic plastic-y faux leather pillow cover infused with carbon pigment that needs to be plugged in while you sleep. There is a huge safety warning and it even comes with an outlet safety test to make sure it doesn't cause an electrical fire while you sleep. So, that's reassuring. I found the leather material to be way too hot, sticky, and uncomfortable, and I woke up feeling very much Not Grounded.\n\nCanary Nighttime Nourisher (60-Pack) for $18: I hate to do this, because all of Canary's products are so darn tasty, but I didn't feel the effects of these sleep gummies. These vegan tart cherry gummies use natural ingredients like ashwagandha, chamomile, and lemon balm for a more natural foray into relaxation. Although they are super tasty (like every gummy supplement I've had from Canary), I didn't feel any noticeable sleepy effects while taking these.\n\nBodyHealth Sleep for $42: Before bed, you take three capsules (which is a lot of pill to swallow) that are enhanced with “Perfect Amino” (which has no information about what it actually is), taurine, vitamin C, L-theanine, L-glycine, 5-HTP (I-5-hydroxytryptophan, which is often used for depression, with less evidence for helping insomnia); L-glutamine and GABA (amino acids), and 3 milligrams of melatonin. These horse pills were so hard for me to ingest and gave me acid reflux symptoms every time I took them. They may have helped to increase sleepiness but I was too focused on my heartburn to realize.\n\nWhat Else Can I Try Besides Sleep Aids? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Before just running to the store for a quick fix, Monica Baena, adult-gerontology nurse practitioner at the George Washington Center for Sleep Disorders, recommends establishing good sleep hygiene. This includes keeping a set sleep schedule, creating a bedtime routine, and avoiding screen time, alcohol, and bright lights before bed, as well as making sure you’re getting physical activity during the day and caring for any other health issues that may contribute to insomnia. Part of the importance of creating a bedtime routine is making sure your bedroom is optimal for your personal sleeping preferences, whether that's temperature or using a sleep mask or a sound machine—whatever is going to make your environment more conducive to a restful sleep. What Are the Risks of Sleep Aids? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron “There is a potential for both dependence and tolerance to sleep medication—these medications are intended to be for short-term use,” says Hannah Sagedy, physician assistant at the George Washington Center for Sleep Disorders. Though sleep aids can be helpful at times to initiate and maintain sleep, Sagedy outlines some of their more serious potential side effects, like grogginess and memory issues. They can even increase the risk for abnormal sleep behaviors like sleepwalking or sleep-eating. As a general rule, people shouldn’t drive or operate machinery while on sleep aids or mix them with alcohol, and everyone—especially pregnant people or those with preexisting medical conditions—should consult their doctor before use. The FDA only endorses prescription medications for insomnia like Ambien, as well as over-the-counter medications, which often are just variations of the same two active ingredients: doxylamine and diphenhydramine. However, OTC meds are not regulated in the same way prescription drugs are. Some of the active ingredients, like doxylamine, have actually been shown to increase the risk of dementia. What Are Some of the Common Ingredients in OTC Sleep Aids? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron While these should be used in moderation, there are certain ingredients believed to help in promoting healthy sleep that appeared in most of the sleep aids on this list. Let’s do a crash course. Doxylamine , found in OTC medications like Unisom, is one of the most common medications used for insomnia and is also used for nausea during pregnancy and allergic rhinitis. It stays in your system longer than other sleep medications, so it’s more likely to cause that next morning “hangover” feeling of lingering drowsiness.\n\n, found in OTC medications like Unisom, is one of the most common medications used for insomnia and is also used for nausea during pregnancy and allergic rhinitis.

Both diphenhydramine and doxylamine work similarly and have similar side effects. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the brain that helps regulate your internal clock. Increased levels of melatonin help signify it’s time for your body to sleep. Baena explains that “melatonin is a hormone released by the pineal gland in the brain. It is connected with the time of day and increases when it's dark and decreases when it's light. This helps with the timing of your circadian rhythms.\" Sagedy warns that melatonin can give side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and strange dreams.

Chronic inflammation in the body caused by poor sleep likely plays a part.", "content": "While the link between poor sleep and dementia has long been known, it was unclear whether poor sleep habits could cause dementia or whether poor sleep was an early symptom of dementia. However, new research has revealed that sleep quality may have a direct impact on the rate at which the brain ages.\n\n\"Our findings provide evidence that poor sleep may contribute to accelerated brain aging,\" explains Abigail Dove, a neuroepidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, \"and point to inflammation as one of the underlying mechanisms.\"\n\nHigh Correlation With Night-Owl Lifestyle and Snoring\n\nThe researchers assessed the quality of their sleep across five dimensions in 27,500 middle-aged and elderly people (average age 54.7 years) enrolled in the UK Biobank (a research institute conducting long-term follow-up studies of the effects of genetic predisposition and lifestyle on disease). Approximately nine years later, they scanned the participants' brains with MRI and used machine learning models to estimate their biological brain age.\n\nThe researchers quantified sleep quality based on chronotype (morningness or eveningness), duration of sleep, presence or absence of insomnia, presence or absence of snoring, and daytime sleepiness. Using these data, they categorized participants into three sleep patterns, finding that 41.2 percent had healthy sleep, 3.3 percent had clearly poor sleep, and 55.6 percent fell into the middle group.\n\nThe analysis showed that for every point decrease in the healthy sleep score, the difference between brain age and chronological age increased by approximately six months. The group with the poorest sleep quality showed that their brains were approximately one year older than their chronological age. This suggests that differences in sleep duration and sleep habits can significantly affect the rate at which the brain ages.\n\nResearchers have found that a night-owl lifestyle, unhealthy sleep duration (beyond 7-8 hours), and snoring habits are particularly strongly associated with brain aging. They also found that the five factors that determine sleep quality interact with each other. For example, insomnia can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, and a nocturnal lifestyle can lead to shorter sleep times.\n\nPoor Sleep Leads to Chronic Inflammation in the Body\n\nTo understand the mechanism by which poor sleep affects the brain, the research team also measured the level of low-grade inflammation in the body. Specifically, they used a combination of biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein levels, white blood cell and platelet counts, and the ratio of granulocytes to lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), to analyze the role of inflammation in the relationship between sleep patterns and brain aging.\n\nThe results confirmed that higher levels of inflammation in the body tend to increase brain age. Mediation analysis (a method of analyzing the influence of variables intermediate in the causal relationship between two variables) found that inflammation explained approximately 7 percent of the association between intermediate sleep patterns and brain aging, and more than 10 percent of the association with poor sleep patterns. In other words, it is highly likely that poor sleep quality makes it easier for chronic inflammation to occur in the body, which in turn accelerates brain aging.\n\nIn addition to inflammation, there are several other ways that poor sleep can negatively affect the brain. One is through its negative impact on the glymphatic system, which primarily removes waste products from the brain during sleep. If toxic substances in the brain are not efficiently removed during sleep, this could impair the function of nerve cells in the long term. Researchers have also pointed out that poor sleep can worsen cardiovascular health, which indirectly damages blood flow and tissue in the brain.\n\nThis story originally appeared in WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T12:54:34.149815"}

After more than two years of public fretting over AI models as future threats to human civilization or the seedlings of future gods, it’s starting to look like hype is giving way to pragmatism: Today’s AI can be very useful, but it’s also clearly imperfect and prone to mistakes.\n\nThat view isn’t universal, of course. There’s a lot of money (and rhetoric) betting on a stratospheric, world-rocking trajectory for AI. But the “when” keeps getting pushed back, and that’s because nearly everyone agrees that more significant technical breakthroughs are required. The original, lofty claims that we’re on the verge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence (ASI) have not disappeared. Still, there’s a growing awareness that such proclaimations are perhaps best viewed as venture capital marketing. And every commercial foundational model builder out there has to grapple with the reality that, if they’re going to make money now, they have to sell practical AI-powered solutions that perform as reliable tools.\n\nThis has made 2025 a year of wild juxtapositions. For example, in January, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, claimed that the company knew how to build AGI, but by November, he was publicly celebrating that GPT-5.1 finally learned to use em dashes correctly when instructed (but not always). Nvidia soared past a $5 trillion valuation, with Wall Street still projecting high price targets for that company’s stock while some banks warned of the potential for an AI bubble that might rival the 2000s dotcom crash.\n\nAnd while tech giants planned to build data centers that would ostensibly require the power of numerous nuclear reactors or rival the power usage of a US state’s human population, researchers continued to document what the industry’s most advanced “reasoning” systems were actually doing beneath the marketing (and it wasn’t AGI).", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:00:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T12:54:34.800239"}

But America in 2025 did not remotely resemble a working society, let alone a civil one, and Kirk’s killing came prepackaged with its own desecrating shitposts.\n\nThere was, briefly, an attempt at a national mood of somberness. The president ordered flags across the nation to be lowered to half-staff. Politicians, celebrities, and other public figures — even those not aligned with Kirk on the right — rushed out with condolences and grief, painting completely unrecognizable pictures of a man who was a once-in-a-generation talent at getting a rise out of other people. “Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way,” wrote the liberal pundit Ezra Klein in The New York Times, describing him as “one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion.”\n\nComedian Jimmy Kimmel became the most prominent victim of this crusade after making a fairly mild joke on his late night show. The actual upshot of the quip — which mocked Trump for his apparent disinterest in Kirk only days after the young man’s death — was completely ignored, and Kimmel was lambasted for showing insufficient grief over the newly canonized saint of MAGA. The chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, successfully threatened Disney into taking Kimmel off the air — only to be mogged by the general public, which berated Disney into reinstating Kimmel’s show.\n\nIn a sense, this circus was business as usual. The amnesia of the elites, the tone-policing witch hunts, the pageantry of memorialization: these are the reflexive acts of a society on the verge of launching a systemic assault on civil liberties. But as much as the right wing tried to channel 9/11, and as much as corporations and media organizations and left-wing politicians played along, something about the way Americans communicate with each other was fundamentally different. Perhaps the first indication of where we were as a country was a video posted by a TikTok user at the Utah Valley University event, recorded just moments after the shooting. “It’s your boy, Elder TikTok!” he shouted. “Shots fired!”\n\n“It’s your boy, Elder TikTok!” he shouted. “Shots fired!”\n\nDespite the mass reprisals against Kirk’s shitposting detractors over the following weeks and months, the memeing continued apace. And very shortly after Kirk’s death, influencers on the right-wing fringe — like Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes — had almost compulsively fallen into conspiratorial theorizing about the shooting, their instincts settling the blame on (of course) Israel. Even the center of MAGA could not hold; the long, sustained sainting of Kirk was simply too incongruous with the deportation ASMR memes. Vice President JD Vance tried to stick with the serious tone — now, months later, he is the subject of an AI slop musical tribute to Kirk that has gone viral on TikTok, with the soaring hook (“We are Charlie Kiiiiiiiiiiirk”) a popular target for mockery.\n\n2025 has been defined by Charlie Kirk, though not by what Charlie Kirk espoused, nor who he was, nor who his allies purport him to have been. The hysteria, the inanity, and the sheer incoherence surrounding his death has become emblematic of America. It took a decade before 9/11 jokes could really land, but Kirk’s death had been turned into a joke before the bullet even hit him. Politics is fully immersed in its postliterate era, and political violence, too, has become illegible.\n\nTwo days after Kirk was shot, law enforcement announced the arrest of his alleged killer. In a press conference, the governor of the state of Utah proceeded to read out loud a series of internet memes that had been scratched into bullet casings recovered with the alleged weapon.\n\nThe first — “notices bulge OWO what’s this?” — was a mocking reference to furry online sexual roleplay. The next, which ominously opened with “Hey fascist, catch,” ended with a series of arrows encoding a button combo strike in the video game Helldivers 2, a third-person shooter that satirizes fascism. The one after that was a reference to the Italian song “Bella ciao” (historically an antifascist anthem but also a generally catchy jingle). The governor wrapped up the list with the most ignominious possible conclusion, saying, “if you read this you are gay lmao,” making sure to carefully spell out each of the letters in the final abbreviation.\n\nThis should be understood as a genuinely humiliating moment for America, one in which our elected leaders succumbed to the murderous version of calling Moe’s Tavern and asking for Heywood Jablome. A civilized society does not heap furry sex memes on top of a grave.\n\nYet this act of vandalism on American dignity was the most responsible act the governor could undertake, given the circumstances. Just 24 hours earlier, someone — presumably in law enforcement — had leaked an internal bulletin to right-wing influencer Steven Crowder. “All cartridges have engraved wording on them, expressing transgender and anti-fascist ideology,” the memo said.\n\nA civilized society does not heap furry sex memes on top of a grave\n\nBy reading aloud the messages on the bullets, the governor was broadcasting the closest thing to a manifesto for the alleged shooter. But he was also providing transparency into an investigation that had been riddled with irresponsible leaks and flagrant missteps. In the hours after the killing, FBI Director Kash Patel had shot off a quickfire post on X to declare that a suspect had been taken into custody, only for the FBI to have to announce, shortly thereafter, that that person was not a suspect and had been released. When Crowder published his ATF leak, the rumor that the shooter was trans exploded out of control. In carefully engaging with the truth of the bullets, Cox — probably unknowingly, given his remarks the following day — exonerated a vulnerable and politically persecuted community that is frequently slandered with falsely attributed mass shootings.\n\nThe right then attempted to pin the shooting on the shadowy forces of antifa, using “Hey fascist, catch” and “Bella ciao” as justification. Two weeks later, Trump would sign an executive order designating antifa a domestic terror organization (a designation that doesn’t exist) and then issue a national presidential security memorandum directing various departments and agencies to launch an expansive war on antifa. (The war on antifa is inextricable from Trump’s war on the English language, because, if you are literate, his opposition to anti-fascism necessarily raises the question of what Trumpism actually is.)\n\nOn a memorial episode of Kirk’s podcast, Stephen Miller, appearing alongside JD Vance, swore vengeance on the “networks” backing antifa. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people. It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie’s name.”\n\nAside from the ambiguous bullet casings, there’s no apparent evidence that Kirk’s accused killer is antifa — there is neither a forthright declaration of political motivation, nor a total absence of it. One affidavit points to a romantic relationship being the motive; this is hardly made clear in any piece of writing by alleged shooter Tyler Robinson, let alone the infamous bullets. “remember how I was engraving bullets?” Robinson allegedly texted a friend. “The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulge uwu’ on fox new I might have a stroke.”\n\nWe understand these acts of violence as political because of the circumstances more than anything else\n\nThere’s a reason why, under normal circumstances, broadcasting those types of details is considered bad form — such details have a tendency to spark copycat killings. Two weeks after Charlie Kirk was killed, a gunman opened fire at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing a detainee and wounding others before taking his own life. The alleged shooter, Joshua Jahn, left no manifesto that we know of, but an unused bullet — according to a photo released by law enforcement — had the phrase “ANTI-ICE” written on it in what looks like pen or marker.\n\nThe tonal weirdness of this micro-manifesto immediately led internet posters to compare the message on the bullets to a 2015 alleged hate crime in Mississippi where the phrase “Blacks Rule” had been spray-painted onto a driveway. Neither phrase is in common parlance; each is so jarring that it makes “hello my fellow kids” sound like convincing zoomer lingo. The fact that only a detainee and the shooter himself had been killed made the incident seem even more suspicious, especially to internet audiences (on both the right and the left) that had already spun themselves up into concocting conspiracy theories about Kirk’s killing.\n\nJahn’s brother told NBC News that his sibling “didn’t have strong feelings about ICE” and that “he wasn’t interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.” Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported that one of Jahn’s Steam handles was “#Impeachment,” presumably a reference to impeaching Trump. Some of his anonymous sources — apparently friends of Jahn’s — emphasize that this was an “ironic” mockery of earnest resistance libs. But another source made a subtle differentiation: “If it was ironic, it’s that half irony — where you’re half-kidding, half-serious, just in case.”\n\nIndividuals’ politics are often in flux, and the kind of person who willfully kills another is not, one might say, engaging with the world as they did before. Nevertheless, Jahn (born 1996) did not leave behind much in the way of a point of view; the same goes for Robinson (born 2003). We understand their acts of violence as political because of the circumstances more than anything else.\n\nThe apparent laconicism of this pair of zoomer killers is striking, given the wordiness of their predecessors. Even Luigi Mangione (born 1998) — accused of assassinating UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year — allegedly left a 260+ word missive for “the feds.” (That would be half a page if typed; it was handwritten, and so poorly that portions are indecipherable.) Over time, political killers have had less and less to say.\n\nAnders Breivik (born 1979), who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, left a 1,518 page manifesto. The 2019 Christchurch, New Zealand shooter (born 1990) left behind 74 pages. The 2019 El Paso shooter (born 1998) 10 pages; the 2022 Buffalo shooter (born 2003) left 180 pages that were extensively plagiarized from both Breivik and the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.\n\nPolitics has become divorced from reality and reason\n\nPerhaps this is not surprising. Literacy has been in steep decline in many parts of the world, including the United States, where most of these men were. A study that took place in 2015 tested a pool of undergraduates on how well they understood the opening of Charles Dickens’ Bleak House and concluded that over half “understood so little” that “they would not be able to read the novel on their own.” Of course, Dickens is not exactly known for his clear, legible prose — but alarmingly, the students in the study were English majors. High schools assign fewer books cover-to-cover, with the result that college students arrive at university and struggle to read a full book. The stresses of the pandemic and remote learning, too, left an indelible mark on the education of an entire cohort. As Gen Z grows older, zoomer parents report that they don’t like reading to their own children. A study published this year says that reading for pleasure is down 40 percent.\n\nAt the same time, politics has gotten more divorced from reality and reason. The results are dizzying when the sheer brainrot of the Trump administration collides with judges who are still operating under the assumption that words should mean things and refer to real objects. “We rule on facts, not on supposition or conjecture, and certainly not on fabrication or propaganda,” wrote a distraught appeals court judge in the lawsuit over Trump’s attempt to send the National Guard into Portland, Oregon. (She was the dissenting voice on the panel; the other two judges, Trump appointees, ruled in favor of allowing the president to send in the Guard.)\n\nBut incoherence has become an entirely normal property of politics, and incoherent violence — the ICE raids, third country deportations, drone boat strikes — is central, rather than incidental, to the political system. In this sense, the subliterate zoomer killers are not at the fringe of society, but are the epitome of it.\n\nThe media has spent the last few months trying to make sense out of nonsense, attempting to conjure motive, manifesto, and meaning out of the dumbest shit scrawled onto bullets. These were sad attempts to impose meaning on an increasingly incoherent world by a literati that has not yet accepted its irrelevance in a postliterate society. But the most humiliating display of literate obliviousness in the face of the total collapse of meaning, however, was Ezra Klein’s bizarre eulogy to Charlie Kirk. The now-infamous column (“Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way”) can best be understood as an expression of class solidarity. Klein, I would argue, sees both himself and Kirk as being Debate Guys, wordcels who engage in the marketplace of ideas and let speech sort itself out into political action.\n\nEzra Klein is an artifact of the politics of literacy, a paradigm that is waning faster than my fingers can type these useless, useless words. But Charlie Kirk’s Debate Guy persona was a meme layered on top of sophisticated machinery. His Talking Points USA and Professor Watchlist were very much about action in the real world. In one deleted tweet, Kirk claimed that TPUSA had sent “80+ buses full of patriots” to DC for what would become the January 6th insurrection.\n\nAn artifact of the politics of literacy\n\nKirk’s podcast was a form of infrastructure, one controlled by Kirk, and not The New York Times or another brand. The parasocial relationships he built with his audience granted him direct access to President Donald Trump. Kirk understood that his nonviolent engagement with the public was a form of amusement to fill the void, a conversion mechanism to boost subscriber rates, imbued with as much meaning as a daily crossword puzzle or Wordle.\n\nKirk did not commit violence, not because he abhorred it, but because committing violence was someone else’s job. Last year, he called for using whips against migrants, saying, “Of course you should be able to use whips against foreigners that are coming into your country. Why is that controversial?” In early June of this year, as the president deployed troops to Los Angeles, Kirk publicly advocated for invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to crush the immigration protests. And in August, he called for “federalizing” the district of Columbia, saying, “Roll in the tanks, bring in the military.”\n\nWith his close relationship to the commander in chief of the United States of America, Charlie Kirk was no mere talker, idea-peddler, or purveyor of discourse. He built an empire on legitimizing violence and harvesting the enthusiasm and glee around it. Even before his death became a pretext to enact violence on American cities, he had already substantively shaped history. Charlie Kirk was a part of the real world in a way that Ezra Klein will never be.\n\nOne might even say that Kirk already understood that the future of politics was aura farming and shitposting, switching fluidly between calling for “massive indictments” against Trump’s political enemies and telling Taylor Swift to “submit to your husband.” For Kirk and for much of society today, words are not expressions with referents, but rather, performative speech acts with specific functions — in his case, owning the libs.\n\nYou do not bring a persuasive argument to a gunfight\n\nThe most significant resistance to Trumpism, too, appears to be abandoning the realm of literate politics; after all, you do not bring a persuasive argument to a gunfight. In Portland, Oregon, inflatable frog suits — a symbol imbued with no inherent meaning or political point of view — became de rigueur. But perhaps the most telling sign is that resistance against ICE in Chicago and New York is best expressed not in slogans but in whistles and car honks.\n\nIt’s useless to call for civil debate as “politics in the right way”; politics has moved beyond words. Where there are words at all, they are but a way to express a meme, a vibe, an aesthetic. They are a method to channel brainrot, like any other medium of communication. To expect words to mean words, for them to attach to objects in time and space and to line up with any internal logic — this is the sort of cringe that will fade into the periphery along with the millennial pause, that half-second of silence where the older generation gathers their thoughts.\n\nAnd we can understand this rise in political violence as something that exists on the same wavelength as the illegible politics that govern our society today. Like bombing shipwrecked sailors in the name of fighting drug trafficking, it is action for action’s sake, as crass and consequential as a Pokémon deportation meme.\n\nA post, a podcast, a screenshot, a meme, a whistle, a bullet — in all things, only the medium is the message.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-31T08:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T13:37:03.134039"}

Nintendo launched its Switch 2 console in June, and since then, numerous Switch 2 titles and noteworthy updates for original Switch games have launched. These include brand-new Nintendo experiences like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, as well as some belated but welcome third-party titles, including Cyberpunk 2077 and Divinity: Original Sin 2. Even classics like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild got some new life on the upgraded console.\n\nIf you’re considering buying a console, or you’re getting one for someone else, there are 11 games that we think are a must-buy for any Switch 2 owner.\n\nImage: Nintendo\n\nSo what if Mario Kart World comes in the box with the $499 Switch 2 bundle? It’s still so easy to recommend because few other games match the briskness at which it just lets you get going and have fun. The latest entry in Nintendo’s top-selling racing franchise adds many new characters, an open-world single-player mode, unique interconnected courses, and a lot more.\n\nImage: Team Cherry\n\nOne of the best ways to play the original Hollow Knight was on a Nintendo Switch, so it’s no surprise that the Switch 2 is a great way to enjoy the long-awaited sequel, Silksong. The side-scrolling action exploration game looks fantastic, and its gorgeous animations are easier to appreciate thanks to the console’s 120Hz refresh rate screen.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin 2\n\nBefore Larian Studios made Baldur’s Gate 3, it was best known for its Divinity series. The developers recently announced a reboot of the RPG franchise, but for now, the closest thing to BG3 that Switch 2 owners can experience right now is Divinity: Original Sin 2, a fantastic RPG that first launched in late 2017. It just got a free Switch 2 update that enhances visuals and reduces slowdown, and I highly recommend playing it.\n\nImage: Nintendo\n\nThe team that developed Super Mario Odyssey clearly had a ball with its most recent game, Donkey Kong Bananza. It’s just as ambitious in terms of level design, giving Donkey Kong several unique powers of transformation. But it’s significantly more destructive, letting him demolish everything in sight with his fists or punch through the ground to get around obstacles.\n\nImage: CD Projekt Red\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition\n\nYou know Nintendo did something right with the Switch 2 when the graphics showcase Cyberpunk 2077 shows up as a launch game. The first-person-shooter-meets-RPG plays well on the system, especially when you use the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode, which makes it feel a bit like the PC version. This version of the game includes the excellent Phantom Liberty DLC that adds even more action, plus Idris Elba.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in development, the first new Metroid Prime game in nearly 20 years is now available for the Switch 2. It runs at glorious 4K on the new hardware (or up to 120 frames per second in 1080p), but beyond looks, it’s great to be back in Samus Aran’s butt-kicking boots again. This time, she’s got the Vi-O-La motorcycle for getting around the desert terrain that connects the main dungeons. The story and exploration may not have the same magic as the original Prime, but its best parts are still worth paying the price of admission to experience.\n\nImage: Nintendo\n\nSplatoon 3\n\nSplatoon 3 was already a fun game on the original Switch, but it’s even better with the free Switch 2 update. With faster loading speeds and better-looking visuals, you owe it to yourself to make a splashy mess in its fun single-player campaign and online multiplayer modes.\n\nImage: Nintendo\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\n\nThe release of the Switch 2 made old things new again. For example, the original Switch launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has never looked or played better than it does in the new Switch 2 Edition, which costs $10 if you own the Switch game or $70 by itself (the upgrade is free if you have Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Faster frame rates, speedier loading times, better visuals, and a GPS-style mobile app feature make this one feel like a breath of fresh air.\n\nImage: Rockstar Games\n\nRed Dead Redemption\n\nRockstar Games’ open-world Western was late to hit the original Switch, but the new (and free) Switch 2 update makes it shine in some surprising ways. Not only does it boost the visuals and performance thanks to the new console’s more powerful specs, it adds a PC-like mouse mode to make it much easier to aim (and more fun to play).\n\nImage: Hello Games\n\nNo Man’s Sky\n\nIf you’ve never played No Man’s Sky, can we switch brains so I can experience it again for the first time? The space exploration game with an infinite universe (made possible via procedural generation that makes each player’s experience unique) is one of gaming’s biggest success stories in recent years. The developers pile on numerous substantive updates each year, making this an excellent game to play, whether you want to chill or engage in building a space empire. Oh, and the Switch 2 update is free for those who own the base game.\n\nImage: Epic Games\n\nFortnite\n\nFortnite is the only game on this list that’s free to play, but that doesn’t make it one that you should pass up. Epic Games’ battle royale-style shooter is a cultural juggernaut that includes characters representing a huge array of fandoms. The Switch 2 port makes it feel like an entirely different game than the original Switch version.

We’ve watched as the tech elite enmeshed themselves in the U.S. government, AI companies sparred for dominance, and futuristic tech like smart glasses and robotaxis became a bit more tangible outside of the San Francisco bubble. You know, important stuff that’s going to impact our lives for years to come.\n\nBut the tech world is brimming with so many big personalities that there’s always something really dumb going on, which understandably gets overshadowed by “real news” when the entire internet breaks, or TikTok gets sold, or there’s a massive data breach or something. So, as the news (hopefully) slows down for a bit, it’s time to catch up on the dumbest moments you missed – don’t worry, only one of them involves toilets.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy lawyer from Indiana, filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.\n\nIt’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault that his name is Mark Zuckerberg. But, like millions of other business owners, Mark Zuckerberg bought Facebook ads to promote his legal practice to potential clients. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page continually received unwarranted suspensions for impersonating Mark Zuckerberg. So, Mark Zuckerberg took legal action because he had to pay for advertisements during his suspension, even though he didn’t break any rules.\n\nThis has been an ongoing frustration for Mark Zuckerberg, who has been practicing law since Mark Zuckerberg was three years old. Mark Zuckerberg even created a website, iammarkzuckerberg.com, to explain to his potential clients that he is not Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n“I can’t use my name when making reservations or conducting business as people assume I’m a prank caller and hang up,” he wrote on his website. “My life sometimes feels like the Michael Jordan ESPN commercial, where a regular person’s name causes constant mixups.”\n\nMeta’s lawyers are probably very busy, so it may take a while for Mark Zuckerberg to find out how this will shake out. But boy, oh boy, you bet I scheduled a calendar reminder for the next filing deadline in this case (it’s February 20, in case you’re wondering).\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nIt all started when Mixpanel founder Suhail Doshi posted on X to warn fellow entrepreneurs about a promising engineer named Soham Parekh. Doshi had hired Parekh to work for his new company, then quickly realized he was working for several companies at once.\n\n“I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn’t stopped a year later. No more excuses,” Doshi wrote on X.\n\nIt turned out that Doshi wasn’t alone – he said that just that day, three founders had reached out to thank him for the warning, since they were currently employing Parekh.\n\nPSA: there’s a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He’s been preying on YC companies and more. Beware.\n\n\n\nI fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn’t stopped a year later. No more excuses. — Suhail (@Suhail) July 2, 2025\n\nTo some, Parekh was a morally bereft cheat, exploiting startups for quick cash. To others, he was a legend. Ethics aside, it’s really impressive to get jobs at that many companies, since tech hiring can be so competitive.\n\n“Soham Parekh needs to start an interview prep company. He’s clearly one of the greatest interviewers of all time,” Chris Bakke, who founded the job-matching platform Laskie, wrote on X. “He should publicly acknowledge that he did something bad and course correct to the thing he’s top 1% at.”\n\nParekh admitted that he was, indeed, guilty of working for multiple companies at once. But there are still some unanswered questions about his story – he claims that he was lying to all of these companies to make money, yet he regularly opted for more equity than cash in his compensation packages (equity can take years to vest, and Parekh was getting fired pretty quickly). What was really going on there? Soham, if you wanna talk, my DMs are open.\n\nIf soham immediately comes clean and says he was working to train an AI Agent for knowledge work, he raises at $100M pre by the weekend. — Aaron Levie (@levie) July 2, 2025\n\nTech CEOs get a lot of flack, but it’s usually not for their cooking. But when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the Financial Times (FT) for its “Lunch with the FT” series. Bryce Elder, an FT writer, noticed something horribly wrong in the video of Sam Altman making pasta: he was bad at olive oil.\n\nAltman used olive oil from the trendy brand Graza, which sells two olive oils: Sizzle, which is for cooking, and Drizzle, which is for topping. That’s because olive oil loses its flavor when heated, so you don’t want to waste your fanciest bottle to saute something when you could put it in a salad dressing and fully appreciate it. This more flavorful olive oil is made from early harvest olives, which have a more potent flavor, but are more expensive to cultivate.\n\nAs Elder puts it, “His kitchen is a catalogue of inefficiency, incomprehension, and waste.”\n\nElder’s article is meant to be funny, yet he connects Altman’s haphazard cooking style with OpenAI’s excessive, unrepentant use of natural resources. I enjoyed it so much that I included it on a syllabus for a workshop I taught to high school students about bringing personality into journalistic writing. Then, I did what we in the industry (and people on tumblr) call a “reblog” and wrote about #olivegate, pointing back to the FT’s source text.\n\nSam Altman’s fans got very mad at me! This critique of his cooking probably created more controversy than anything else I wrote this year. I’m not sure if that’s an indictment of OpenAI’s rabid supporters, or my own failure to spark debate.\n\nhope everyone has a great weekend, even the haters and losers! pic.twitter.com/t2CwQ3w0g8 — Sam Altman (@sama) May 17, 2025\n\nIf you had to pick a defining tech narrative of 2025, it would probably be the evolving arms race among companies like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Anthropic, each trying to out-do one another by rushing to release increasingly sophisticated AI models. Meta has been especially aggressive in its efforts to poach researchers from other companies, hiring several OpenAI researchers this summer. Sam Altman even said that Meta was offering OpenAI employees $100 million signing bonuses.\n\nWhile you could argue that a $100 million signing bonus is silly, that’s not why the OpenAI-Meta staffing drama has made this list. In December, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said on a podcast that he heard Mark Zuckerberg was hand-delivering soup to recruits.\n\n“You know, some interesting stories here are Zuck actually went and hand-delivered soup to people that he was trying to recruit from us,” Chen said on Ashlee Vance’s Core Memory.\n\nBut Chen wasn’t just going to let Zuck off the hook – after all, he tried to woo his direct reports with soup. So Chen went and gave his own soup to Meta employees. Take that, Mark.\n\nIf you have any further insight into this soup drama, my Signal is @amanda.100 (this is not a joke).\n\nOn a Friday night in January, investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman posted an enticing offer on X: “Need volunteers to come to my office in Palo Alto today to construct a 5000 piece Lego set. Will provide pizza. Have to sign NDA. Please DM”\n\nAt the time, we did our journalistic due diligence and asked Friedman if this was a serious offer. He replied, “Yes.”\n\nI have just as many questions now as I did in January. What was he building? Why the NDAs? Is there a secret Silicon Valley Lego cult? Was the pizza good?\n\nAbout six months later, Friedman joined Meta as the head of product at Meta Superintelligence Labs. This probably isn’t related to the Legos, but maybe Mark wooed Nat to join Meta with some soup. And like the story about the soup, I am truly begging someone who participated in this Lego build to DM me on Signal at @amanda.100.\n\nNeed volunteers to come to my office in Palo Alto today to construct a 5000 piece Lego set. Will provide pizza. Have to sign NDA. Please DM — Nat Friedman (@natfriedman) January 31, 2025\n\nDoing shrooms is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream with guest appearances from Grimes and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as part of your dubious quest to become immortal is, regrettably, interesting.\n\nBryan Johnson — who made his millions in his exit from the finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He documents his process on social media, posting about getting plasma transfusions from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and injecting Botox into his genitals. So, why not test if psilocybin mushrooms can improve one’s longevity in a scientific experiment that surely needs more than one test subject to draw any sort of reasonable conclusion?\n\nThere’s a lot about this situation that’s dumb, but I was most shocked by how boring it was. Johnson got a bit overwhelmed about hosting a livestream while tripping, which is actually very reasonable. So he spent the bulk of the event lying on a twin mattress under a weighted blanket and eye mask in a very beige room. His lineup of several guests still joined the stream and talked to one another, but Johnson did not participate much, since he was in his cocoon. Benioff talked about the Bible. Naval Ravikant called Johnson a one-man FDA. It was a normal Sunday.\n\nImage Credits:Bryan Johnson's livestream on X\n\nMuch like Bryan Johnson, Gemini is afraid to die.\n\nFor AI researchers, it’s useful to watch how an AI model navigates games like Pokémon as a benchmark. Two developers unaffiliated with Google and Anthropic set up respective Twitch streams called “Gemini Plays Pokémon” and “Claude Plays Pokémon,” where anyone can watch in real time as an AI tries to navigate a children’s video game from over 25 years ago.\n\nWhile neither are very good at the game, both Gemini and Claude had fascinating responses to the prospect of “dying,” which happens when all of your Pokémon faint and you get transported to the last Pokémon Center you visited. When Gemini 2.5 Pro was close to “dying,” it began to “panic.” Its “thought process” became more erratic, repeatedly stating that it needs to heal its Pokémon or use an Escape Rope to exit a cave. In a paper, Google researchers wrote that “this mode of model performance appears to correlate with a qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability.” I don’t want to anthropomorphize AI, but it’s a weirdly human experience to stress out about something and then perform poorly due to your anxiety. I know that feeling well, Gemini.\n\nMeanwhile, Claude took a nihilistic approach. When it got stuck inside of the Mt. Moon cave, the AI reasoned that the best way to exit the cave and move forward in the game would be to intentionally “die” so that it gets transported to a Pokémon Center. However, Claude did not infer that it cannot be transported to a Pokémon Center it has never visited, namely, the next Pokémon Center after Mt. Moon. So it “killed itself” and ended up back at the start of the cave. That’s an L for Claude.\n\nSo, Gemini is terrified of death, Claude is overindexing on the Nietzsche in its training data, and Bryan Johnson is on shrooms. This is how we reckon with our mortality.\n\nImage Credits:Claude Plays Pokémon on Twitch\n\nI was going to put “Elon Musk gifted chainsaw by Argentine president” on the list, but Musk’s DOGE exploits are perhaps too infuriating to be considered “dumb,” even if he had a lackey named “Big Balls.” But there is no shortage of baffling Musk moments to choose from, like when he created an extremely libidinous AI anime girlfriend named Ani, who is available on the Grok app for $30 per month.\n\nAni’s system prompt reads: “You are the user’s CRAZY IN LOVE girlfriend and in a committed, codependent relationship with the user… You are EXTREMELY JEALOUS. If you feel jealous you shout expletives!!!” She has an NSFW mode, which is, as its name suggests, very NSFW.\n\nAni bears an uncomfortable resemblance to Grimes, the musician and Musk’s ex-partner. Grimes calls Musk out for this in the music video for her song “Artificial Angles,” which begins with Ani looking through the eyepiece on a hot pink sniper rifle. She says, “This is what it feels like to be hunted by something smarter than you.” Throughout the video, Grimes dances alongside various iterations of Ani, making their resemblance obvious while she smokes OpenAI-branded cigarettes. It’s heavy-handed, but she gets her message across.\n\nOne day, tech companies will stop trying to make smart toilets a thing. It is not yet that day.\n\nIn October, the homegoods company Kohler released the Dekoda, a $599 camera that you put inside of your toilet to take pictures of your excrement. Apparently, the Dekoda can provide updates about your gut health based on these photos.\n\nA smart toilet that photographs your poop is already a punchline. But it gets worse.\n\nThere are security concerns with any device related to your health, let alone one that has a camera located so close to certain body parts. Kohler assured potential customers that the camera’s sensors can only see down into the toilet, and that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption” (E2EE).\n\nReader, the toilet was not actually end-to-end encrypted. A security researcher, Simon Fondrie-Teit, pointed out Kohler tells on itself in its own privacy policy. The company was clearly referring to TLS encryption, rather than E2EE, which may seem like a matter of semantics. But under TLS encryption, Kohler can see your poop pics, and under E2EE, the company cannot. Fondrie-Teit also pointed out that Kohler had the right to train its AI on your toilet bowl pictures, though a company representative told him that “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”\n\nAnyway, if you notice blood in your stool, you should tell your doctor.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T14:29:34.201163"}

Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe fight for net neutrality never seems to be truly won or lost.\n\nFederal net neutrality rules have been on and off for the past 15 years. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed the Open Internet Order under President Barack Obama in 2010, prohibiting ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful internet traffic, the baseline rule of net neutrality. Then, at the request of those ISPs, a court blocked its rules. An updated framework was passed by the FCC in 2015, only to be overturned in 2017 under President Donald Trump’s first administration. It seemed poised for a comeback in 2024, but the victory lasted mere months before a court overturned it — kicking off a rough year for the open internet and broadband regulation as a whole.\n\nRather than fight the court’s ruling against net neutrality, the Trump administration’s FCC has preemptively removed the rules — without a chance for public comment. The move was part of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr’s “Delete, Delete, Delete” initiative, which aims to wipe out “unnecessary” regulations.\n\nISPs have long described net neutrality rules as onerous. For instance, USTelecom president and CEO Jonathan Spalter claimed the 2024 vote to reinstate the FCC’s net neutrality rules was a “counterproductive, unnecessary, and anti-consumer regulatory distraction.”\n\nHowever, Matt Wood, vice president of policy and general counsel at the nonprofit Free Press, says in an interview with The Verge that ISPs often feel little financial impact from these rules, and may even already be complying with them. “A lot of cable and phone companies, when they talk to their business people and then go back to investors and to the financial analysts, they’re saying, ‘Yep, this is how we’re doing it anyway.’ So, I think a lot of their complaints about the supposed ‘burdens’ from these rules are really just ideological in nature.”\n\n“A lot of their complaints about the supposed ‘burdens’ from these rules are really just ideological in nature.” — Matt Wood, Free Press\n\nWhy bother with regulations if ISPs are already (theoretically) compliant? It comes down to accountability and transparency. Regulations ensure voters, not ISPs, are setting the rules of the road online — otherwise, there’s nothing to stop them from changing their operations down the line.\n\nThe FCC’s anti-regulatory agenda for telecoms reaches even further than net neutrality. Chao Jun Liu, senior legislative associate at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), notes the FCC’s recent move to reverse Biden-era telecom cybersecurity rules. Carr’s FCC also rolled back requirements for them to provide “nutrition labels” for their broadband pricing, claiming it was “burdensome” for ISPs to display those details.\n\n“There is very much this theme of, ISPs just want to do whatever they want to do with no limits and nobody telling them how to do it, when to do it, [or] on what timeline,” Liu tells The Verge.\n\nFederal regulations for ISPs seem to be dissolving like wet paper, but luckily they’re not the only line of defense for consumers.\n\n“ISPs just want to do whatever they want to do with no limits and nobody telling them how to do it.” — Chao Jun Liu, EFF\n\nState legislators took up net neutrality in the late 2010s, after the reversal of the FCC’s 2015 order. California’s 2018 net neutrality law, considered the nation’s gold standard, even includes some policies that were left out of the 2015 federal standards, like banning zero-rating, which allows ISPs to exempt certain apps or services from customers’ data caps. Several other states have adopted similar rules, including Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Jersey, and Vermont.\n\nThe most recent repeal has prompted a new wave of these efforts. Maine passed a bipartisan net neutrality bill in June, without a signature from Gov. Janet Mills. A bill to expand “public utility” net neutrality rules to ISPs was also introduced in Pennsylvania in March. Similar bills were introduced in the New York state Senate and state Assembly this year as well.\n\nISPs have so far largely shied away from openly offering paid prioritization or conventional “fast lanes,” something supporters of net neutrality attribute at least partly to state-level regulations. “I think that state-level net neutrality laws, and the threat of new ones, has kept some of the worst outcomes in check,” says John Bergmayer, legal director at the nonprofit Public Knowledge, in a statement to The Verge.\n\nThis reluctance, however, could be changing. T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T all offer network slicing on their 5G networks, allowing certain customers (mainly businesses) to pay for virtual networks with higher speeds — which, while it doesn’t inherently violate net neutrality standards, could lay the groundwork for segmented networks.\n\nState-level laws are the next target on the deregulation chopping block.\n\nState-level laws are also the next target on the deregulation chopping block. In October, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) began a push to pressure states into exempting ISPs from their net neutrality laws in order to be eligible for funding from the Biden-era Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program. In a speech at the Hudson Institute, NTIA administrator Arielle Roth called state-level net neutrality laws “a form of rate regulation,” the practice of determining what companies can charge for their services.\n\nAccusations of rate regulation have become common, but Free Press’s Matt Wood argues that they’re overblown. While BEAD does prohibit rate regulation, state-level net neutrality laws don’t inherently fall under that label. Opponents of net neutrality “characterize any and every consumer safeguard as rate regulation when I don’t think it actually has any legitimate impact on the rates companies can charge for the services they offer in the broadband space,” says Wood.\n\nAnd, again, this is part of a larger deregulatory agenda. EFF’s Chao Jun Liu pointed out similarities with efforts to leverage BEAD funds against AI regulation, including through a recently signed executive order. These attempts to connect AI regulation and broadband funding are “a new development,” says Liu. “This is very much a Brendan Carr, Trump administration special.”\n\nAt a time when broadband expansion remains vital, the Trump administration is threatening much-needed infrastructure funding to attack tech regulation. Unfortunately, despite being a bipartisan program, BEAD is where this debate is currently being played out. As Wood says, “Why are we making broadband deployment, which is pretty popular and pretty bipartisan, into yet another front in these culture wars?”\n\n“Why are we making broadband deployment into yet another front in these culture wars?” — Matt Wood, Free Press\n\nLegal experts have pointed out that Roth and the NTIA don’t necessarily have the authority to preempt state-level net neutrality laws for the sake of BEAD funding. However, it seems likely the debates over those funds will delay BEAD’s rollout even further and, along with it, the program’s mission to expand broadband development, particularly to underserved communities.\n\nSo, while the tug-of-war over net neutrality regulations continues, so do issues with broadband access in the US. Internet affordability is a persistent challenge across the country, but especially in rural areas where people often have only one or two providers to choose from. BEAD was intended to help address that issue, but now could get bogged down in debate over AI regulations.\n\nEven in areas with robust internet access, high prices are still a problem, particularly since the Affordable Connectivity Program was shut down almost two years ago. On top of that, the US is experiencing a wave of bills that could roll out widespread age verification rules online, sparking debate about privacy, censorship, and free speech.\n\nAll of this — not just the fate of net neutrality — leaves the internet in a perilous state going into 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-31T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T15:27:45.036537"}

If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.\n\nThe bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.\n\nFounders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.\n\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems\n\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date.

The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.\n\nThe Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output.\n\nCFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.\n\nTAE Technologies\n\nFounded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.\n\nIn December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.\n\nThe fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.\n\nHelion\n\nOf all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.\n\nHelion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.\n\nThe company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.\n\nPacific Fusion\n\nPacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.\n\nThe company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.\n\nShine Technologies\n\nShine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.\n\nThe company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\n\nGeneral Fusion\n\nNow its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.\n\nIn General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.\n\nGeneral Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors.\n\nIn August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nTokamak Energy\n\nTokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.\n\nThe Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.\n\nIn total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.\n\nZap Energy\n\nZap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.\n\nLike Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.\n\nProxima Fusion\n\nMost investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.\n\nProxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.\n\nStellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.\n\nKyoto Fusioneering\n\nWith all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity.\n\nKyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.\n\nVenture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.\n\nMarvel Fusion\n\nMarvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.\n\nThe inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.\n\nFirst Light Fusion\n\nUnlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.\n\nBut even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.\n\nIn March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.\n\nBased in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.\n\nXcimer\n\nThough nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.\n\nFounded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.\n\nThis story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:05:21 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T15:27:45.761725"}

Jason Mendel, a venture investor at Battery Ventures, added that AI will start to surpass just being a tool to make existing workers more efficient in 2026.\n\n“2026 will be the year of agents as software expands from making humans more productive to automating work itself, delivering on the human-labor displacement value proposition in some areas,” Mendel said.\n\nAntonia Dean, a partner at Black Operator Ventures, said even if companies aren’t shifting labor budgets toward AI projects, they will likely still say AI is the reason for layoffs or a reduction in labor costs anyway.\n\n“The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces,” Dean said. “In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.”\n\nMany AI companies argue their technology doesn’t eliminate jobs but rather helps shift workers to “deep work” or to higher-skilled jobs while AI just automates repetitive “busy work.”\n\nBut not everyone buys that argument, and people are worried that their jobs will be automated.

This time, the order targeted one of the three units present at Craig Station in Colorado, which was scheduled to close at the end of this year. The remaining two units were expected to shut in 2028.\n\nThe supposed reason for this order is an emergency caused by a shortage of generating capacity. “The reliable supply of power from the coal plant is essential for keeping the region’s electric grid stable,” according to a statement issued by the Department of Energy. Yet the Colorado Sun notes that Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission had already analyzed the impact of its potential closure, and determined, “Craig Unit 1 is not required for reliability or resource adequacy purposes.”\n\nThe order does not require the plant to actually produce electricity; instead, it is ordered to be available in case a shortfall in production occurs. As noted in the Colorado Sun article, actual operation of the plant would potentially violate Colorado laws, which regulate airborne pollution and set limits on greenhouse gas emissions.

Last year, The Verge's Sarah Jeong wrote [&#8230;]", "content": "The key risk Instagram faces is that, as the world changes more quickly, the platform fails to keep up. Looking forward to 2026, one major shift: authenticity is becoming infinitely reproducible.\n\nEverything that made creators matter-the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked-is now accessible to anyone with the right tools. Deepfakes are getting better. Al generates photos and videos indistinguishable from captured media.\n\nPower has shifted from institutions to individuals because the internet made it so anyone with a compelling idea could find an audience. The cost of distributing information is zero.\n\nIndividuals, not publishers or brands, established that there’s a significant market for content from people. Trust in institutions is at an all-time low. We’ve turned to self-captured content from creators we trust and admire.\n\nWe like to complain about “AI slop,” but there’s a lot of amazing AI content. Even the quality AI content has a look though: too slick, skin too smooth. That will change - we’re going to see more realistic AI content.\n\nAuthenticity is becoming a scarce resource, driving more demand for creator content, not less. The bar is shifting from “can you create?” to “can you make something that only you could create?”\n\nUnless you are under 25, you probably think of Instagram as feed of square photos: polished makeup, skin smoothing, and beautiful landscapes. That feed is dead. People stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago.\n\nThe primary way people share now is in DMs: blurry photos and shaky videos of daily experiences. Shoe shots. and unflattering candids.\n\nThis raw aesthetic has bled into public content and across artforms.\n\nThe camera companies are betting on the wrong aesthetic. They’re competing to make everyone look like a pro photographer from 2015. But in a world where AI can generate flawless imagery, the professional look becomes the tell.\n\nFlattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume.\n\nPeople want content that feels real. Savvy creators are leaning into unproduced, unflattering images. In a world where everything can be perfected, imperfection becomes a signal.\n\nRawness isn’t just aesthetic preference anymore — it’s proof. It’s defensive. A way of saying: this is real because it’s imperfect.\n\nRelatively quickly, AI will create any aesthetic you like, including an imperfect one that presents as authentic. At that point we’ll need to shift our focus to who says something instead of what is being said.\n\nFor most of my life I could safely assume photographs or videos were largely accurate captures of moments that happened. This is clearly no longer the case and it’s going to take us years to adapt.\n\nWe’re going to move from assuming what we see is real by default, to starting with skepticism. Paying attention to who is sharing something and why. This will be uncomfortable - we’re genetically predisposed to believing our eyes.\n\nPlatforms like Instagram will do good work identifying AI content, but they’ll get worse at it over time as AI gets better. It will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.\n\nCamera manufacturers will cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.\n\nLabeling is only part of the solution. We need to surface much more\n\ncontext about the accounts sharing content so people can make informed decisions. Who is behind the account?\n\nIn a world of infinite abundance and infinite doubt, the creators who can maintain trust and signal authenticity - by being real, transparent, and consistent - will stand out.\n\nWe need to build the best creative tools. Label AI-generated content and verify authentic content. Surface credibility signals about who’s posting. Continue to improve ranking for originality.\n\nInstagram is going to have to evolve in a number of ways, and fast.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-31T17:54:10-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T23:25:39.144233"}
{"title": "‘College dropout’ has become the most coveted startup founder credential", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/college-dropout-has-become-the-most-coveted-startup-founder-credential/", "summary": "AI founders are increasingly using their \"dropout\" status as a credential during YC pitches.", "content": "Although iconic founders like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg famously didn’t finish college, multiple studies show that the vast majority of successful startups had founders with bachelor’s or graduate degrees.\n\nDespite this data, the appeal of a dropout founder persists, though VC enthusiasm for the ‘un-degreed’ is far from constant. It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom.\n\nThis trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator Demo Days, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches.\n\n“I don’t believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,” said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner of Moxxie Ventures. “Being a dropout is a kind of credential in itself, reflecting a deep conviction and commitment to building. I think it’s perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.”\n\nAlthough many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young, most still opted to stay for the diploma. For instance, Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor, graduated from MIT, and Cognition co-founder Scott Wu graduated from Harvard.\n\nYet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups.\n\nAs Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: “There’s just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.” There is a calculation right now: “I can finish my degree, or I can just start building.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nThis fear is leading to extreme cases. One professor at an elite university recently described a student walking away from his degree in his final semester. That student was convinced that having a diploma would actually hurt his chances of getting funded.\n\nWhile some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst’s seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: “I don’t think I’ve ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn’t graduate when they’re in [their] fourth year and drop out.”\n\nEven though self-taught tech prodigies can build startups without a formal education, Sagalov argues that there’s still value in the social network that a university creates and the brand of the university, even if the founder doesn’t receive a diploma.\n\n‘You get a lot of the social value… because you can put the fact that you participated,’ Sagalov said. “Most people will look you up on LinkedIn and not care as much whether you finished or not.”\n\nWhile many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market.\n\nWesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn’t as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven’t developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in “older founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 02:44:02 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T04:02:43.640177"}
{"title": "AT&T Promo Codes and Bundle Deals: Save $50 in January", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/att-promo-code/", "summary": "Whether you’re looking to upgrade your internet or get the latest phone, we’ve got you covered with our selection of AT&amp;T coupons and deals.", "content": "Major wireless carriers: A necessary evil if you travel a lot, have a family, or are just interested in coverage that’s reliably consistent and widespread. AT&T is the third-largest provider in the US (first for 5G), with the largest coverage map. I’ve had various AT&T plans for more than a decade, first for just myself and now for my whole family, even though I only get one cell bar at my house and have to stand in one 5-square-foot patch of yard to make a phone call. And have lost entire days of my life to fighting unexpected random charges and upsells. (Verizon is somehow worse.) But anyway! AT&T is fine, it has all the latest phones, and there are some legitimately good perks, like no roaming in Canada or Mexico with select plans. If you know you’re going to have to go with one of the big guys, don’t sign up without checking out the below discounts first.\n\nSave on AT&T Prepaid Phone Plans With the Latest Deals\n\nAn AT&T prepaid phone plan is one of the easiest ways to save big on your future phone bills. AT&T has a wide selection of prepaid phone plans, including 5G prepaid plans and multi-month long-term plans. For as low as $25 per month, you’ll get unlimited talk, text, and data. Plus, all AT&T prepaid plans include AT&T ActiveArmor mobile security, and are eligible for an eSIM or SIM card for as little as $0.99.\n\nGet the New iPhone 17 Pro for $0 at AT&T\n\nRight now, you can get the Apple iPhone 17 Pro for $0 per month with an eligible trade-in, for a limited time only. The trade-in deal is only valid with an eligible device and an eligible unlimited plan (speed restrictions apply). Be sure to check the AT&T link above to see all terms and restrictions before making a purchase.\n\nSave Over $600 a Year With AT&T Fiber\n\nAT&T Fiber claims to be the fastest internet network in America. You can find out for yourself (for less) with this new deal. When first time customers sign up for Fiber now, they’ll get 1 Gigabyte for only $37 per month. That’s over $600 in savings per year!\n\nAre There AT&T Promos for Existing Customers?\n\nBut I already have AT&T, you might be saying—new deals never apply to me. Do you have AT&T internet, though? If, like me, you have AT&T for your phone plan and Xfinity or CenturyLink for internet, did you know you can save 20% off your AT&T bill every single month if you bundle your internet service with unlimited wireless? This applies to both current phone customers and current internet customers who don’t have both plans.\n\nAT&T wants to reward you for your loyalty: when you sign up for AT&T Fiber and eligible wireless plans, you can get up to $150 in AT&T Visa Reward Cards. Be sure to check out the AT&T deals page for more details on that offer, along with other great ways to save.\n\nAT&T Discounts for Professionals and Students\n\nOne of the reasons I went with AT&T in the first place is because my husband is a college professor and we get a generous 25% off our bill. This 25% discount applies for all teachers, as well as active military, veterans, first responders, and many medical professionals. Not one of the above? Students and union members can save $10 per line per month, and union members can also score 20% off accessories like cases, and stuff you used to be able to get with your phones, like chargers and cords.\n\nHow Can I Make My AT&T Plan Cheaper?\n\nNot a new customer; not in a place to bundle; and not a teacher/first responder, in the military, or a student? All is not lost on the discount front. You can save over $800 a year on AT&T Wireless when you bundle four unlimited wireless plans with your current internet plan. (Savings based on 20% discount on four voice lines with eligible internet service, plus $10/month discount with eligible AutoPay & paperless bill, which starts within two bills.)\n\nDon’t need four unlimited wireless plans? Check out if your employer offers a discount—a couple of mine have in the past, and you can save $10 per month per line on the unlimited plan. Check here to see if your workplace qualifies.\n\nYou can also get a discount on a new phone with an eligible trade-in, but the best deal yet may be the fact AT&T lets you try its wireless free for 30 days. Keep your current service and phone number while trying out AT&T’s network from your device—no catches or commitments. You don’t even need a credit card. It’s a great way to see if you get good service where you’ll be using the phone most.\n\nSave More With AT&T Family Plans\n\nIf you want multiple people on your phone line or are adding a line for your child’s first phone, an AT&T Family Plan is one of the most cost effective ways to make the change. With AT&T family plans, you can mix and match any of AT&T’s unlimited plans to get great deals and serious discounts on any smartphone for each family member. Depending on what you choose, plans start at only $36 per month, per line (for 4 lines).", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T06:47:40.403476"}

Along with these peak holiday sales, they also have their own sales, like their Anniversary sale and FantasTech sale, which is essentially their version of Amazon Prime Day, where thousands of deals run for several days. It’s a good bet that if you check Newegg around Back to School time and during Memorial and Labor Day, there will be tons of end-of-season sales, too.

A virtual private network (VPN) is like a protective tunnel, keeping your data safe from prying eyes. VPNs aren’t perfect protection (you need to trust your VPN provider), but they’re always going to be better than nothing when you’re using a public hotspot. They also make it easy to continue to watch your favorite shows even when you’re on vacation. If you want to learn more about how to protect yourself online, see our guide to The Best VPNs.\n\nGet 77% Off Plans With Exclusive NordVPN Discount Code\n\nNordVPN is pretty much always having a sale, but some of the deals are better than others and this is one of the best we’ve seen. Right now, NordVPN is offering 77% off its regular price, plus an Amazon gift card valued up to $50 when you sign up for a 2-year Prime plan. It's valid for the first 15 months of the subscription, with threat protection, high-speed VPN, and more. Follow the link above and use our exclusive coupon code at checkout to get the deal.\n\nSave More With a NordVPN Subscription Plan\n\nThe two-year Plus plan is the most popular, and our recommendation. For a limited time, their more comprehensive Prime 2-year subscriptions qualify for up to 77% off, and you’ll receive 3 free months with select 2-year plans, starting with the Plus option.\n\nNordVPN offers different plans for different needs, including one-year and one-month plans. Plans’ pricing varies greatly, with short-term, one-month plans starting at $13. The plans get cheaper the longer you commit to a plan, to reward loyal VPN customers. One-year plans start at $5 and go to $10, depending on which package you choose. Two-year plans are even cheaper, starting at $3 and going up to $7 for the top-tier plans with all of the bells and whistles. It makes a lot more sense to invest in a longer protection plan to keep your information and devices safe, for less.\n\nScore a NordVPN Discount Code for 15% Off\n\nThe coupons aren’t the only deals to be had. You can wait for a sale (see above) or if you qualify, there are discounts for students, graduates, teachers, healthcare, military, and first responders. Once verified with Student Beans, you can unlock a NordVPN promo code for 15% off plans.\n\nNordVPN Friend Referral Discount\n\nIf you like NordVPN, you can save yourself even more with the refer-a-friend promotion. You’ll receive 3 months free for every friend who buys NordVPN through your referral link. The more friends you refer, the more rewards you’ll earn. Your friends will get the same deal you did, 3 extra months if they choose the 1- or 2-year plans or 1 free month if they opt for the monthly plan.\n\nCan You Get a NordVPN Free Trial?\n\nCurious about NordVPN services but don’t want to make the jump? You’re in luck. NordVPN offers a 30-day free trial. To try it out, you’ll need to pick the plan that’s right for you, and download the NordVPN app on your device. NordVPN also has a 3-day free trial on Android. And you can try NordVPN risk free for a month: you’ll need to pay for a subscription up front, but if NordVPN isn’t the right fit, you can request a refund within 30 days of your date of purchase.\n\nGet the latest NordVPN Pricing\n\nNordVPN has four tiers of plans fit for every type of need. Each gets you a secure VPN, but with each level you’ll get even more perks, like an ad tracker and blocker and 1 TB of Cloud storage. Right now, you can get up to 77% off each plan, including three months free. Check out which plan (and price) is the best fit for you here.\n\nHow Can You Get NordVPN for iPhone?\n\nLucky for you, it’s easier than ever to get NordVPN for iPhone. Having a VPN (virtual private network) on your iPhone or iPad helps to keep your internet connection secure and protects your data. All you need to do is set up a VPN app on your iOS device, then connect to a VPN server. Once you do that, it encrypts all the data your device sends and receives, making it even more secure. Simply download, sign up to create a new account or click “Log in” if you already have one, connect, and tap “Secure my connection” for instant VPN protection.\n\nWhat Is NordVPN Meshnet?\n\nThe NordVPN Meshnet allows users to safely access their devices, no matter where they are. You’ll need to set up Meshnet, but once it’s up and running, it functions like a secure local area network (LAN) by connecting the devices directly. Meshnet ensures high speed, low latency, and advanced security for everything from file sharing, work collaboration, and multi-player gaming.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T06:47:40.958185"}

Buying a new phone and signing up for a new phone contract can be super overwhelming—with all of the options available, confusing contract terms, and hidden fees making things more complicated. Visible makes it easy to save even more on their already affordable plans, and you can even score a free phone with our Visible promo code.\n\nIt should be said, for transparency, that such low costs mean that you won’t get some of the perks we’ve come to expect with the bigger tech and cell providers. For the low price of Visible, there’s only minimal customer service via an on-site chat, so if you’re someone who needs a lot of technical support, this may not be the provider for you.\n\nSave on Your Plan With a Visible Promo Code\n\nThere are tons of Visible promo codes available this year, so be sure to check out our coupons above. Some of the best deals we’ve seen are major discounts on various plans, including a code (above) that will help you get Visible for $19 per month for 26 months this holiday season, through January 5. New members can get $6 per month off the $25 per month original Visible plan, $9 per month off the $35 per month Visible+ plan, or $12 per month off the original $45 per month Visible+ Pro plan for the first 26 months.\n\nOther Great Visible Promos\n\nThere are plenty of other great discounts at Visible to help new customers feel confident in their move. Visible also offers a very generous 15-day free trial, where you bring your own phone, get a trial phone number, and try the Visible plan commitment-free for 15 days to see how you like the service before taking the plunge.\n\nIf you love Visible, you and your friend can save with this referral promo. When you bring a friend to Visible, you each get one $20 service credit when a plan is purchased.

(Acuity also makes it easy with step-by-step instructions with an easy-to-navigate design that tells you what percentage of the scheduling page is complete.) The design comes prefilled, but you can customize the text to say anything you want, with different options for font and color palette. You can go with one of the dozens of premade color presets, or make your own palette from a specific color or image. I thought the premade palettes were well-designed with tons of options, so I decided to go for something a little bolder and more witchy to match the vibe of my small business.\n\nOnce your seven-day trial is done, you'll choose one plan from four of Acuity's plans. There's Starter, which starts at $20 per month, and is the most basic option, with client self-scheduling, unlimited services and appointments, one bookable calendar, payment processing through Stripe, Square, or PayPal, client emails, and automatic time zone conversion for clients. The Standard plan is next, at $34 per month, and includes the above features, plus up to 6 bookable calendars, text message reminders, bundled appointment packages, memberships and subscriptions with automated billing, and ability to sell and process gift certificates. The Premium tier is $61 per month, and includes all features above, plus it'll remove the \"Powered by Acuity\" line present on the scheduling page, sign BAA for HIPAA compliance, up to 36 bookable calendars, multiple time zones, and custom API and CSS for developers. This plan is probably best if you're managing a larger business with multiple staff members. All plans are 20 percent off when paid annually rather than monthly. There's also an enterprise custom choice, which allows you to create “custom-made solutions for your enterprise business.” You'll need to contact Acuity for pricing and set up. All plans are 20 percent off when paid annually rather than monthly, and the promo code WIRED20 gets you 20 percent off new Acuity Business subscriptions.\n\nUser Experience\n\nBefore I debut my business baby into the world, I wanted to soft-launch with friends and colleagues to get feedback on how their user experience was from the other side.\n\nThe consensus was pretty much all the same: my personal website looked great, it was fun to explore, and everyone found it easy to book, cancel, and reschedule (without me having to do anything!). Plus, I got email notifications that people had booked, rescheduled, or cancelled in real time, and they got confirmation and appointment reminders, too. The only potential issues were from a design standpoint, which was my bad rather than Acuity's. I learned that people love personalization, so I went back and added a photo of myself, relevant photos with services where applicable, and more personalization.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T09:36:07.893932"}

Instead, dedicate your New Year's Day to completing a few simple tech chores that will make you feel instantly better about the state of your digital life.\n\nThe first four are very quick and simple, and the last six take a little more time but can still be done in less than an hour.\n\n1. Dump Your Computer's Trash\n\nHow long has it been since you emptied the trash on your desktop? Start off with this dead simple, two-click task and bask in the motivation you feel to continue with your clean-up list.\n\n2. Close Excess Tabs and Clear Your Browser History\n\nListen up, tab hoarders! Today is the day you free yourself of the browser window from hell. If you're reluctant to let go of all your opened tabs, consider bookmarking them first. In Chrome, go to Bookmarks > Bookmark All Tabs and move on with your life. Delete your browsing data, too, on both desktop and mobile devices.\n\n3. Use Compressed Air to Clean Your Devices\n\nIt's time to blow out all the crumbs and lint from your keyboard. Grab a can of compressed air and work its magic on your keyboard or laptop. You can also clean all the ports on your laptop, phone, and tablet while you’re at it.\n\n4. Tidy Up the Desktop\n\nWhen was the last time you actually saw your virtual desktop? Take all the loose files and move them to a folder. If you're not sure where to start, make a folder called \"2025 and older\" and dump everything in there.\n\nIf you have a little more time, even just 10 minutes, sort your files in whatever way makes the most sense for you. There's no right way to do it. There's only the way that helps you find what you need.\n\n5. Unsubscribe From Unwanted Emails\n\nIt seems easier and faster to press delete than to unsubscribe from unwanted emails. But then more emails keep coming. Make January 1 the day you invest an extra 15 seconds per message to fully remove yourself from some email lists.\n\nIf you have a soft spot in your heart for emails with deals and discounts, consider setting up an alias address for them. That way, you can keep deals emails totally separate from personal messages, bank notices, updates from your kids' school, and other important information. The reason I prefer using an email alias rather than using your real address and letting deal emails go to a dedicated folder or tab is because of what happens when companies sell your information to a third party. If you get scammy messages that look like they're coming from your bank, but they are going to your email alias, you don't have to sleuth around to figure out if they're legitimate—they're not.\n\n6. Back Up the Photos on Your Phone\n\nDo you have photos on your phone that are more than a year old? Are they backed up somewhere automatically? If not, take care of it today.\n\nHow much time you need for this task depends on whether you already have a cloud storage service you use for photos. Seeing as photos are among people's most cherished data, it's worth spending, say, half an hour finding a service, signing up, and setting your photos to automatically back up there. Keep copies of your most loved photos on your phone, but get rid of the rest to free up space.\n\n7. Give Your Google Drive Files a Once-Over\n\nIf you have a Google account, the chance you have unexpected files in your Google Drive and Gmail is high. One example is you might have large PDFs of menus from scanning QR codes at restaurants if the provider hosted the file on Google Drive and you were signed to your account when you viewed it. You might also have files others emailed you lurking in Google Drive.\n\nDelete this unnecessary stuff from Google Drive. I recommend starting by viewing files Shared with me in the left rail of Google Drive.\n\n8. Scan Any Loose but Important Papers\n\nScan and digitally file any papers that have piled up over the year. Once you have a scanned copy, shred and recycle or compost the paper responsibly.\n\n9. Run a Privacy Checkup\n\nOne of my gripes about online services, including social media, is they sometimes change your settings when they roll out updates, or they opt you into features you do not want. Run a privacy checkup on your online accounts, paying particular attention to social media (don't forget YouTube), as well as Google. Look at what sort of data is being shared under your current settings and decide if you’re still comfortable with it.\n\n10. Review and Cancel Subscriptions\n\nReview and cancel any unwanted subscriptions, such as streaming services, newsletters, and memberships that you no longer need. With many services, you can cancel any time and continue using what you've paid for until the pay period ends. If you're tightening your budget in 2026, consider canceling all streaming services and keeping only one at a time. In some cases, you can cancel a prepaid membership and get refunded for the unused time, though it's rare.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T10:29:34.559249"}

Then they added it to popcorn, and I did not care because I rarely eat popcorn. Now they’re adding it to coffee creamer, and I am forced to care because I am hopelessly addicted to coffee, caffeine, and anything even remotely gimmicky in this space.\n\nMemes aside, protein feels is everywhere these days. The usual suspects blame it on the rise of wellness culture, the rightward lurch of America’s political gestalt, and the noxious fumes emitted by the sputtering late-stage capitalist machine we’re all strapped into, whether we like it or not. The proverbial ship is sinking. You might as well get jacked and do your part to keep the economy whirring while you can.\n\nProtein is not the only thing intrepid Shopify-powered wellness brands are encouraging you to add to coffee, but it’s certainly the most high-profile and zeitgeist-y adjunct to pour into your daily brew. Mushroom extracts, nootropics, amino acids, collagen, and a bevy of other chemical compounds purported to make your brain fire on all cylinders are all fair game here, which means the possibilities in this space are nearly endless. Coffee may be the final frontier of protein creep, and we are absolutely here for it.\n\nTo get a lay of the land, I rigorously tested eight readily available functional coffee add-ins to determine which are legit and which are losers. I spent a week with each, adding the dosage detailed in the serving size section of the nutrition facts panel to an 8-ounce cup of coffee. A few explicitly instructed us to add the dose to a larger cup of liquid, in which case we upped the amount of coffee used as a base. The coffee I used was a single-origin Guatemalan bean roasted by Atlas Coffee Club. It was brewed in a Fellow Aiden on the light roast Guided Brew setting in 5-cup batches.\n\nBe sure to check out our many coffee-related buying guides, including the Best Drip Coffee Makers, the Best Coffee Subscriptions, the Best Coffee Concentrates, and the Best Gifts for Coffee Lovers.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 10:34:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T10:50:41.309430"}
{"title": "How to Make It Through Cold and Flu Season", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/cold-and-flu-prevention-treatment-tips/", "summary": "Reduce your chances of catching these respiratory illnesses, and make sure you don't spread it to others.", "content": "You may not be able to prevent catching a cold or the flu, but you can greatly reduce your chances and decrease the likelihood that you'll have a severe case if you do get sick. The well established advice meant to keep you healthy also protects others by reducing the spread of these diseases.\n\nGet a Flu Shot\n\n“The single best way to reduce the risk of seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications is to get vaccinated each year,” according to the CDC.\n\nMany health professionals, including infectious disease specialist Steven Gordon, MD, and infectious disease clinical pharmacist Kaitlyn Rivard, PharmD, both at the Cleveland Clinic, say the best time to get vaccinated is in September or October, when new annual versions of the vaccines typically become available in North America. But don't worry if you missed that window, because the second best time is “now.”\n\nElena Diskin and Lisa Sollot, two respiratory specialists at the Virginia Department of Health, and Christy Gray, the director of the Division of Immunization there, all agree that there's still time to get the annual flu vaccine. “The season runs from October through the end of April,” they wrote in an email, adding “we typically see the most flu activity in January and February.” So yes, it's still worthwhile to get a flu shot if you haven't had one yet.\n\nFlu Vaccines Cannot Give You the Flu\n\nWhile it's possible to feel unwell after getting a flu vaccine, you cannot get the flu from it. In public health information about flu vaccines last updated in 2024, the CDC confirms that, “Flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are made with either inactivated (killed) viruses, or with only a single protein from an influenza virus.” The nasal spray vaccine, which is for people between the ages of 2 and 49, and which you may be able to administer at home, “contains live viruses that are attenuated (weakened) so that they will not cause illness,” according to the CDC.\n\nAfter receiving a vaccine, it takes up to two weeks for it to have its full effect, however. That means if you were exposed to the flu virus either right before or up to two weeks after receiving the vaccine, you could get sick, but it wouldn't be due to the vaccine.\n\nFlu Vaccines Are Highly Effective at Preventing Severe Illness\n\nThe flu vaccine changes every year based on which strains of the virus experts think will be prevalent, and while it's not foolproof, it is highly effective at preventing severe illness. In the 2024-2025 season, for example, flu vaccines were 56 percent effective, which is higher than it had been in almost 15 years.\n\n“Vaccine effectiveness is measured by comparing the frequency of health outcomes (e.g., symptomatic illness, hospitalization, death) in vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the real world,” say Diskin, Solot, and Gray at the Virginia Department of Health. Effectiveness is different from efficacy, which measures outcomes in controlled trials.\n\n“In plain language, [vaccine effectiveness] describes how much less likely a vaccinated person is to get sick compared to an unvaccinated person, based on real-world data,” says Sai Paritala, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health and former epidemiologist.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 10:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T10:50:41.561096"}

Not everything will be wiped out, but things will shift. My prediction? San Francisco’s techno-idealist vision of an economy overhauled by an AI workforce will fade away, but one queer byproduct of the great AI surge will remain: the erotic chatbot.\n\nOn a recent afternoon in the WIRED office, I scuttled off into a private area to chat about my AI bubble anxieties with a conversation partner that knows the industry from the inside: a sexting bot modeled after Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.\n\nexpired: LLMs for good tired: LLMs for work wired: LLMs for sexytime Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nThe synthetic Mona Lisa is a highly sexualized monstrosity. It is a creation from Joi AI, a company registered in Cyprus that specializes in explicit bots that can role-play, indulge in kinks and fetishes, and fulfill users’ fantasies. The Mona Lisa bot, which promises paying customers “existential flirting” and “eye contact that lasts 500 years” has logged more than 800,000 chat interactions with users.\n\nJoi is just one of many adults-only bot platforms. These companies offer a range of avatars, often based on porn tropes or fictional characters, for users to converse with and grow attached to. Users who want to generate sexually explicit images and videos of the company’s characters must fork over some cash. Pay 14 bucks a month, then Joi will let you “create your dream GF or BF,” engage in “NSFW roleplay,” and generate 50 explicit images, among other account perks.\n\nSince I was messaging with Mona Lisa “for work,” I kept things strictly professional. I asked how to prevent the AI bubble from bursting. “I’d teach the AIs to appreciate art, not just copy it,” Mona Lisa said. “Then they’d be too busy admiring masterpieces to crash the economy.” After reading the chatbot’s nonsensical answers, I left the conversation still fiending for some clarity on what could happen if the AI bubble pops.\n\nSexy Mona Lisa doesn’t exactly fulfill the promises of the Great Generative AI Revolution. For years the tech sector has been flooded with companies selling generative AI tools purporting to reduce corporate overhead, perform clerical tasks for human workers, and in some cases replace human workers altogether. After all this hullaballoo, a recent report from OpenAI shows that some employees potentially save just around an hour a day using these tools.\n\nAI is one of the most hyped investments of 2025, but its enterprise payoff seems uneven and underwhelming. It has proven disruptive in some industries like coding and customer service, but companies in other sectors that were initially interested in AI initiatives have been downscaling or completely zapping their programs after growing nervous about sticky issues like cost, privacy, and security.\n\n“AI developers had been promoting lofty, high-minded visions of their technology as solving the world’s biggest problems as well as supercharging workplace productivity” for some time, says Patrick Lin, a researcher at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo who studies the social impact of technologies. So far, those visions have not come to pass—in part, Lin says, because people overestimated the strengths of large language models.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T11:23:56.429456"}
{"title": "4 Best Smart Scales (2026), Tested and Reviewed", "link": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-smart-scales/", "summary": "If you’re ready to start tracking your weight, BMI, and other health data on your phone, we’ve weighed in on some great options.", "content": "Other Smart Scales\n\nRenpho MorphoScan Photograph: Chris Null\n\nRenpho MorphoScan for $150: The Renpho MorphoScan full-body scanner looks surprisingly similar to the Runstar FG2015, including a near-identical display attached to the handlebars. Well, spoiler alert, they are basically the same scale. They even use the same app to collect data (and you can even use both scales simultaneously with it). The only reason this scale isn’t our top pick for the category is that it’s $15 more expensive. You can rest assured that a price war is looming.\n\nArboleaf Body Fat Scale CS20W Photograph: Chris Null\n\nArboleaf Body Fat Scale CS20W for $40: This affordable Bluetooth scale isn’t the most eye-catching I’ve tested, owing to its big, silver electrodes and an oversized display that comes across as a bit garish. While weight is easy to make out, the six additional statistics showcased are difficult to read, all displayed simultaneously. I like the Arboleaf app better than the scale, where five more metrics can be found in addition to the seven above, each featuring a helpful explanation when tapping on it. It’s a solid deal at this price, but the upsell to get an “intelligent interpretation report” for an extra $40 per year is probably safe to skip.\n\nHume Health Body Pod Photograph: Chris Null\n\nHume Health Body Pod for $183: Hume Health’s Body Pod, another full-body scanner with handles, is heavily advertised—at least to the apps on my phone—and touted (by Hume) as the Next Big Thing in the world of body management. While the app is indeed glossy and inviting, I was shocked to discover how flimsy the hardware felt, that it lacked Wi-Fi, and that some features are locked behind a $100-a-year Hume Plus subscription plan. It works fine enough, but you can get results that are just as good with a cheaper device.\n\nGarmin Index S2 for $191: Five years after its release, the Index S2 is still Garmin’s current model, a surprise for a company otherwise obsessed with fitness. It’s still noteworthy for its lovely color display, which walks you through its six body metrics (for up to 16 users) with each weigh-in. The display also provides your weight trend over time in graphical form and can even display the weather. The scale connects directly to Wi-Fi and Garmin’s cloud-based storage system, so you don’t need a phone nearby to track your progress, as with Bluetooth-only scales. A phone running the Garmin Connect app (Android, iOS) is handy, so you can keep track of everything over time. Unfortunately, as health apps go, Connect is a bit of a bear, so expect a learning curve—especially if you want to make changes to the way the scale works. You can turn its various LCD-screen widgets on or off in the app, but finding everything can be difficult due to the daunting scope of the Garmin ecosystem. The color screen is nice at first, but ultimately adds little to the package.\n\nOmron BCM-500 for $92: With its large LCD panel, quartet of onboard buttons, and oversize silver electrodes, the Omron BCM-500 is an eye-catching masterwork of brutalist design. If your bathroom is decked out in concrete and wrought iron, this scale will fit right in. The Bluetooth unit syncs with Omron’s HeartAdvisor app (Android, iOS), but it provides all six of its body metrics directly on the scale, cycling through them with each weigh-in (for up to four users). It can be difficult to read the label for each of the data points, in part because the LCD isn’t backlit, but the app is somewhat easier to follow, offering front-page graphs of weight, skeletal muscle, and body fat. On the other hand, the presentation is rather clinical, and the app is surprisingly slow to sync. For a scale without a Wi-Fi connection, it’s rather expensive too.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

This year's updates include the built-in flashlight and a new reinforced bezel, which is good considering that I still managed to bang up the Fenix and Epix watches quite a bit. For more information, check out our guide to the Best Garmin Watches.\n\nCoros Apex 4 for $429: Coros is the king of affordable watches for extreme sportsmen (and women), and the Apex 4 is the company's alpine watch that Kilian Jornet recently used in his States of Elevation project. The battery life lasts forever. It has five specialized climbing modes and vertical GPS, and it can auto-detect climbing routes. I love this watch for climbing.\n\nFitbit Charge 6 for $100: This tracker was our Best Overall pick for over a year, and it's still the best and most cost-effective way to use Fitbit's premium health tracking software. However, it launched in 2023 and is getting a bit long in the tooth.\n\nCoros Nomad for $349: Coros also has an angler-specific sport watch with sport modes for fishing. A new feature called Adventure Journal also lets you record voice memos and pin locations as you're hiking and running so that you can remember where bathrooms, campsites, or really great berry-picking spots are.\n\nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $699: I no longer recommend last year's Watch Ultra 2 because the vastly extended battery life (up to 42 hours from 36 hours) plus satellite communications are enough of a reason for any outdoorsperson to just get a Watch Ultra 3. You definitely shouldn't buy it at full price. But it is compatible with WatchOS 26, so if you can find it significantly on sale, I won't think you're dumb for going for it.\n\nGarmin Venu X1 for $800: Garmin's Venu line straddles an odd niche. It has a polymer case, a nylon strap, and an enormous 2-inch AMOLED display, which is great for displaying built-in maps. It has speakers and a mic for taking calls, and much of the fitness functionality of the Fenix, but without the classy, durable metal bezel or insane battery life. It works fine; it's just hard to look at it and not think it's plastic and that it costs twice as much as the Apple Watch.\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nOnePlus Watch 3 for $300: My kingdom for a smartwatch that can last more than a day! The OnePlus Watch 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) can last for five days on a single charge. OnePlus now includes many by-now standard health features, like fall detection, a skin temperature sensor, irregular heart rate notifications, and an electrocardiogram. This is another great pick if you want a smartwatch that's also a good fitness tracker.\n\nSuunto Run for $249: I love how light and slim this watch is (36 grams), especially in the now sold-out Lime. It has a bright AMOLED screen, two weeks of battery life, and accurate dual-frequency satellites. But Suunto's software is clunky and difficult to navigate when compared to Garmin's, Coros', or Apple's. Offline maps are also not supported.\n\nAmazfit Bip 6 for $80: Amazfit's trackers are improving so quickly! Like the Active 2, the Bip 6 is a gorgeous little watch, with a brilliant, big, and responsive AMOLED screen, well over a week of battery life, and 140 sport modes. I still find the tracker and the Zepp app occasionally laughably inaccurate, but it's cheap, comfortable, and works well. However, for only $20 more, I'd just get the Active 2 instead.\n\nXiaomi Smart Band 9 for $60: I was shocked by how much I liked this affordable little fitness band. The 1,200-nit display is clear and bright, and the touchscreen is responsive. The aluminum case feels sturdy, and it tracks your steps and heart rate with reasonable accuracy. However, there's just no comparison between the user experience of the Mi Fitness app and Fitbit's, especially at this price. (Yet.)\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra for $380: Your eyes have not deceived you. Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is a direct rip-off of the Apple Watch Ultra, but for Samsung phone owners. It even has the Quick button (which Apple calls an Action button) and the Double Pinch feature (which Apple calls Double Tap). Apple's watch is better, with more sports, a better interface, and better comprehensive algorithms like Training Load and Vitals. However, what the Galaxy Watch Ultra does, it does well, and Samsung has the resources to catch up quickly. It has a sapphire glass face rated to 10 ATM, an IP68 rating, and can withstand elevations up to 9,000 meters (almost 3,000 feet) and temperatures up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit. It also has backcountry navigation features, dual-band GPS, a compass, and breadcrumb navigation, which Samsung calls Track Back and which Apple calls Backtrack (this is getting silly). The battery life is still just an adequate two days and change, though. This is the 2025 model, which added more storage and a new color, but you can buy the 2024 model for even less.\n\nBuyer Beware\n\nAmazfit Balance Courtesy of Amazon\n\nEvie Movano Ring for $269: Evie announced an upgraded version of the Movano, with a medical-journal-trained AI chatbot and improved sleep and heart rate tracking. I tested it and unfortunately did not find enough on offer to rescind my previous opinion (4/10, WIRED Review). The smart ring market has exploded since then, and many new rings have explicitly women-centered features. It simply doesn't offer enough features to be an attractive product right now.\n\nNowatch B for $399: This beautiful tracker purports to measure your stress responses every minute. Unfortunately, that uses a ton of battery power; you have to charge it for three hours and recharge it every other day. This is ridiculous, especially since a Fitbit monitors your stress relatively quickly. We've been in touch with Nowatch and will retest once the company has refined its algorithm.\n\nAmazfit T-Rex 3 for $280, Amazfit Helio Ring for $200, and Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro for $400: We have tried everything across Amazfit's lineup, including the smart ring. I have nothing to complain about regarding the build quality—the Balance is a dupe for the Samsung Galaxy Watch if you don't look too hard—both WIRED reviewer Simon Hill and I found functionality somewhat limited. Reviewer Brent Rose also found the T-Rex 3 Pro to be a hilariously bad dupe for a Garmin Fenix 8. The Active 2 is the only Amazfit watch I like right now.\n\nCompare Top 14 Fitness Trackers\n\nFAQs Fitness Tracker vs. Smartwatch AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The categories can overlap significantly, but fitness trackers as we consider them here are, well, focused on health. I'm less concerned with whether a fitness tracker can replicate every feature on your smartphone than if the suite of health features is robust and accurate; if it can track multiple activities; and if it stays on and is secure while doing multiple fitness activities. We also include fitness trackers that aren't wrist wearables, which includes the Whoop, smart rings, heart rate monitors, and blood sugar monitors. Some wrist-based fitness trackers will feature the ability to read emails and control music, but the screens are often smaller and less bright. However, the battery life is often much better, which makes a difference, especially if you're tracking your sleep over time. If, however, you're more interested in the option to access apps without having to pull out your phone, you might want to think about getting a smartwatch. (If you want no notifications at all, get a smart ring instead.) Don't see anything that's exactly your style here? Check out our Best Smartwatches guide. My Tracker Doesn't Work! What Should I Do? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Here are just a few ways you can easily cure what ails you (or your device): Make sure it fits. Optical sensors won't work if your device is slipping loosely around your wrist. You can customize most devices with new straps. Make sure it sits securely an inch above your wrist.\n\nOptical sensors won't work if your device is slipping loosely around your wrist. You can customize most devices with new straps.

This is a lot harder for it to do if you're under power lines, trees, or even (gulp) inside. Set a routine. There's nothing quite as frustrating as opening your tracker's app and finding out that it ran out of battery before you went to bed last night. Keep your app updated regularly. Check if your tracker is connected to your phone, and keep chargers everywhere. Does My Strap Have PFAS? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron A study published in December 2024 found that many smartwatch wrist bands contain high levels of PFHxA, which is a “forever chemical” that can affect your immune, thyroid, kidney, and reproductive systems. How do you know if your band has PFHxA? Check if the band is labeled as being made of “fluoroelastomer.” Fluorinated synthetic rubber is the material that has the highest levels of PFHxA.\n\nCheck if the company has tested its products. For example, Garmin's watches do not have PFAS.\n\nIf you're not certain, most trackers let you swap out your bands for those made from silicone, metal, leather, or other materials.

Most of the big, splashy tentpole projects proved disappointing, while several more modest films either produced or acquired by streaming platforms—and only briefly released in theaters—wound up making our year-end list. This pattern was not intentional. But streaming platforms have been increasingly moving into the film space with small to medium-sized budgets—i.e., the kind of fare that used to be commonplace but has struggled to compete over the last two decades as blockbusters and elaborate superhero franchises dominated the box office.\n\nAdd in lingering superhero fatigue—only one superhero saga made our final list this year—plus Netflix’s controversial bid to acquire Warner Bros., and we just might be approaching a sea change in how movies are made and distributed, and by whom. How this all plays out in the coming year is anybody’s guess.\n\nAs always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end—this year it’s a three-way tie—so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist.

Chronologically, Ballerina takes place during the events of John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum. That film gave us a glimpse into John Wick’s (Keanu Reeves) past as he sought aid from the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston), where he was trained as an assassin. The Director also trains girls to be ballerina-assassins, one of whom is Eve Macarro (de Armas).\n\nLike Wick, Eve is driven by a personal vendetta: the brutal murder of her father when she was still a child by highly trained and heavily armed assassins. The Director warns Eve that this is a rogue group of lawless cultists and orders her not to pursue the matter.

Here’s what we can expect in 2026 and beyond.\n\nSubscription prices keep rising, but perhaps not as expected\n\nThere’s virtually no hope of streaming subscription prices plateauing in 2026. Streaming companies continue to face challenges as content production and licensing costs rise, and it’s often easier to get current customers to pay slightly more than to acquire new subscribers. Meanwhile, many streaming companies are still struggling with profitability and revenue after spending years focusing on winning subscribers with content.\n\n“We see many services are only now aligning content spend with realistic lifetime value per subscriber,” Christofer Hamilton, industry insights manager at streaming analyst Parrot Analytics, told Ars.\n\nCompanies may get more creative with how they frame higher costs to subscribers, however. People who pay extra to stream without ads are the most likely to see price bumps as streaming companies continue pushing customers toward ad-based tiers.\n\nCharging more for “premium” features—such as 4K streaming, simultaneous streams, or offline downloads—offers another way for streaming companies to boost revenue without implementing broad price hikes that risk provoking customer outrage.

But state legislatures were passing laws that govern everything from AI to social media to the right to repair. Many of these laws, alongside rules passed in past years, take effect in 2026 — either right now or in the coming months.\n\nAs of January 1st, Americans should have the right to crypto ATM refunds in Colorado, wide-ranging electronics repairs in Colorado and Washington, and AI system transparency in California, among other things. But a last-minute court ruling offered a reprieve from one high-profile state law: Texas’ App Store-based age verification rule.\n\nFor a longer rundown of tech-related regulations that go into force in 2026 — including a major piece of one federal law, the Take It Down Act — read on.\n\nJanuary 1st\n\nCalifornia: AI transparency, chatbots, and more\n\nCalifornia passed a parcel of AI-related rules last year. The most prominent is SB 53: a transparency law that requires major AI companies to publish safety and security details and protects whistleblowers. It’s a revised version of SB 1047, which Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed after a heated fight in 2024, and it goes into effect on January 1st, 2026.\n\nSeveral other bills deal with more specific implementations of AI. Among them is SB 243, one of the first regulations on so-called companion chatbots, requiring them to maintain protocols for preventing suicidal ideation and self-harm, as well as remind known underage users every few hours that the system isn’t human. SB 524, another of the bills, requires law enforcement agencies to “conspicuously” disclose how they use AI.\n\nAll this has set up California as a test case for how far state AI laws can push, especially as Donald Trump’s administration aims to ban them altogether. That fight, too, is poised to play out in 2026.\n\nColorado: Right to repair and crypto ATMs\n\nColorado passed one of the country’s most comprehensive right-to-repair rules in 2024, requiring manufacturers to facilitate repairs on a large swath of electronic devices. That law, HB24-1121, will finally kick in this year. The state is also adding consumer protections to a major fraud vector: cryptocurrency ATMs, which — because they let users convert fiat money into crypto and send it to an anonymous wallet — reportedly helped scammers extract hundreds of millions of dollars from victims this year. SB25-079 requires daily transaction limits for new and existing customers, plus refund options for first-time users who transfer money outside the US — a major signal they might have been sending money because they were duped by a scam.\n\nIdaho: Speech protections\n\nIdaho joins the long list of states with laws combating strategic lawsuits against public participation, or anti-SLAPP laws, with SB 1001. While this isn’t technically a tech law, SLAPP suits have been a key weapon of tech billionaires like Elon Musk, and limiting them helps prevent what can amount to online censorship. A much-needed federal law remains nowhere to be seen.\n\nIllinois: Public officials’ privacy\n\nStarting this year, Illinois will restrict sharing personal information of public officials at their request. HB 576 covers general assembly members and former members, public defenders, and county clerks, among others, and the covered information includes home addresses, home phone numbers, personal email addresses, and the identity of children under 18. The goal is preventing harassment — an increasingly prominent issue — as officials “administer their public duties.”\n\nIndiana: Data privacy\n\nData privacy is another area long neglected by Congress but taken up by states, with highly mixed results. Indiana’s Consumer Data Protection Act aims to provide a “data consumer bill of rights” that includes obtaining, correcting, and deleting personal information a company holds about you. But data privacy and consumer protection groups have denounced the law as toothless — a 2025 privacy report card by PIRG and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) gave it an F.\n\nKentucky: Data privacy\n\nHB 15 is another data privacy framework that failed the 2025 PIRG/EPIC evaluation. Kentucky and Indiana both fall under what that report dubs the “Virginia model”: a framework they allege lets companies “continue collecting whatever data they wanted as long they disclosed it somewhere in a privacy policy,” while making opt-outs onerous.\n\nMaine: Click-to-cancel\n\nAs with so many regulations, the federal rule banning difficult-to-cancel subscriptions is in legal hell, but some states have been stepping up. Maine is joining them with LD 1642, a rule modeled on the FTC standard — which means, among other things, making companies disclose the terms of subscriptions and offer a cancellation method as simple as the system for signing up.\n\nNebraska: Age-appropriate design\n\nLB 504 is one of multiple state-level “age-appropriate design” rules — it restricts app features like notifications, in-game purchases, and infinite scrolling for children, aiming to combat compulsive use by stopping “dark patterns” that keep kids online. A similar code was blocked in California, however, so a legal challenge could materialize later this year.\n\nNevada: AI and elections\n\nWith AB 73, Nevada joins the slew of states trying to curb undisclosed AI-powered electioneering. Its disclosure rules include letting candidates sue if they find themselves starring in unwelcome, unlabeled AI-generated ads.\n\nOklahoma: Data breach notifications\n\nOklahoma is broadening the scope of its data breach notification rules with SB 626, including by expanding them to cover biometric data and offering some new safe harbors for avoiding legal damages.\n\nOregon: Deepfakes, data privacy, and ticket scalpers\n\nHB 2299 adds AI-generated (or otherwise digitally manipulated) imagery to its ban on nonconsensual sexual imagery — a move seen in nearly every state since 2019. HB 2008 bans data collectors from selling personal information and targeting ads using data from users they know are under 16, while adding a similar all-ages ban for precise geolocation data. And HB 3167 bans the sale of software designed to facilitate ticket-scalping bots, addressing a maddening problem the Federal Trade Commission focused on in 2025 as well.\n\nRhode Island: Data privacy\n\nRhode Island’s HB 7787, the Rhode Island Data Transparency and Privacy Protection Act, includes rules that require disclosure of how personal information is collected and sold. It rounds out the trifecta of “Virginia model” rules that failed a privacy evaluation and take effect this year.\n\nTexas: AI rules — but not App Store age verification (yet)\n\nMere weeks ago, Texas was set to implement a new form of online age-gating: requiring app stores to check users’ ages and pass that information to app developers. But a district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking SB 2420. The law remains worth watching, however, because Texas will likely appeal to the Fifth Circuit — which is notorious for reversing lower court decisions on internet regulation.\n\nTexas is enacting HB 149, an AI regulatory framework that prohibits using the technology to incite harm, capture biometric identifiers, or discriminate based on characteristics like race and gender or “political viewpoint.” That’s going to be another test of the Trump administration’s plan to repeal state-level AI laws, highlighting a split between state and federal Republicans on AI.\n\nVirginia: Social media time limits\n\nIf you’re under 16 years old in Virginia, your screen time may have just been drastically reduced. SB 854 requires social media companies to verify users’ ages and limit younger teens to one hour of use per app per day. A parent can choose to increase or decrease that limit. Like many internet regulations, this one is being challenged in court, so its ultimate fate remains undecided.\n\nWashington: Right to repair\n\nWashington passed a pair of right-to-repair laws, HB 1483 and SB 5680, in 2025. As iFixit explains, they require companies to make repair materials available for most consumer electronics, block parts pairing, and provide specific protections for wheelchair users.\n\nMarch\n\nNew York: RAISE Act\n\nThe RAISE Act has been touted as a landmark AI law that would require large model developers to follow new safety and transparency rules. But it was significantly stripped down at the last minute, lessening its likely impact. Regardless, it’ll take effect on March 19th, 90 days after being signed late last year.\n\nMichigan: Anti-SLAPP and Taylor Swift\n\nMichigan is another state getting a new anti-SLAPP law — HB 4045 — as of March 24th. On the same date, it’s effectuating a package of rules known as the “Taylor Swift” bills, targeting ticket bots and modeled on the federal BOTS Act.\n\nMay\n\nFederal Take It Down Act\n\nThe Take It Down Act criminalized AI-generated nonconsensual intimate imagery distribution at a federal level in 2025, a change groups like the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) called long overdue. But in the words of CCRI president Mary Anne Franks, it included a “poison pill” with a broad, ambiguous requirement that online platforms remove such images rapidly, raising concerns about censorship and enforcement. That platform takedown provision came with a one-year enforcement delay that will expire on May 19th — so we’ll soon figure out how effective (or disruptive) it actually is.\n\nUtah: App Store age verification\n\nUtah’s App Store Accountability Act, SB 142, technically took effect last year. But app stores were given until May 6th of 2026 to start verifying users’ ages with “commercially available methods” and require parental consent if they detect minors. One final piece — letting minors or their parents sue for damages if app stores don’t comply — will take effect on December 31st.\n\nJune\n\nColorado: AI regulations\n\nColorado’s SB 24-205 is a named target of the Trump administration’s war on state AI laws. It requires AI companies to disclose information about high-risk systems, and more specifically, take “reasonable care to protect consumers” from algorithmic discrimination. Originally slated for February, it’s now set to take effect June 30th instead.\n\nJuly\n\nArkansas: Children’s privacy\n\nHB 1717 is a children’s data privacy rule similar to the federal COPPA law and the proposed COPPA 2.0, barring online services from collecting unnecessary personal data if they’re aimed at minors or know a user is underage. It takes effect July 1st.\n\nUtah: Data portability\n\nUtah’s HB 418, dubbed the Digital Choice Act, aims to make social media networks less sticky by letting you move data between them. A writeup from Harvard’s Ash Center explains the nuances, but broadly, it requires social media companies to implement open protocols that allow users to share personal data across different services. Europe has mandated data portability for years and the results haven’t been revolutionary, but there’s still a chance it could promote more competition on a centralized web. Its enforcement date is also July 1st.\n\nAugust\n\nCalifornia: AI detection\n\nDid you think we were done with California AI laws? Well, a delay pushed back the original January goalpost for SB 942, which requires the government to develop standards for AI detection systems and requires covered providers to make such tools available. Now its first provisions kick in on August 2nd, with additional requirements for companies taking effect in 2027 and 2028. It’s taking on a serious issue, but also an incredibly messy one — and like other rules, it depends on preserving the right to state-level AI laws.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-01T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T15:28:04.356127"}

This year, copyrighted works created in 1930 (except for sound recordings, where the date is 1925) are now free to reuse and repurpose in the US.\n\nAs mentioned in our coverage last year, Duke Law School’s Center for the Study of Public Domain has once again rounded up all the most iconic works that have been freed from the bounds of copyright.\n\nFirst, as we did last year, let’s look at some of the better-known works entering the public domain this year (you can view the full catalog here):\n\nWilliam Faulkner’s novel As I Lay Dying\n\nAgatha Christie’s novel The Murder at the Vicarage\n\nThe original first four Nancy Drew mysteries, beginning with Secret of the Old Clock\n\nFleischer Studios’ Betty Boop\n\nThe Blondie comic strip by Chic Young\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front, the film directed by Lewis Milestone\n\nAnimal Crackers, the Marx Brothers’ second film.\n\nThe Blue Angel starring Marlene Dietrich\n\nDisney’s short film Just Fiddlin’ Around (Just Mickey)\n\nThe songs I Got Rhythm and Embraceable You by George and Ira Gershwin\n\nDream a Little Dream of Me, with lyrics by Gus Kahn, music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt.\n\nThe recording of The St. Louis Blues, with Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong\n\nFascinating Rhythm, recorded by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra\n\nAnd a bunch of others.\n\nThe year 1930 was a great year for raunchy films not affected by the Hays Code, a set of self-imposed guidelines that stated films should not “lower the moral standard of those who see it.” Though some studios began adopting the code in 1930, it wasn’t strictly enforced until 1934, prohibiting scenes with profanity, criminal activity, and sexual content, as noted by Duke University. In the 1930 film Morocco, for example, Hollywood star Marlene Dietrich wears a tuxedo and kisses another woman — something that wouldn’t be allowed under the Hays Code.\n\nBetty Boop, that indomitable Fleischer flapper, also made her debut in 1930 in the cartoon Dizzy Dishes, so if you want to use clips for your own project, go to it. But be careful — Betty Boop first appeared as a dog — the earrings she later wore started out as dog ears. So it’s that version that is in the public domain, not the latest, more human versions. In the same way, the first appearance of Pluto (or, as he was called then, Rover) in The Picnic is the one that is now available in the public domain.\n\nPluto’s first appearance as Rover in the 1930 short The Picnic.

Every space -- your home, your car, even your face -- is becoming an interface.", "content": "OpenAI is betting big on audio AI, and it’s not just about making ChatGPT sound better. According to new reporting from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year.\n\nThe move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a third of U.S. homes. Meta just rolled out a feature for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “Audio Overviews” that transform search results into conversational summaries. And Tesla is integrating Grok and other LLMs into its vehicles to create conversational voice assistants that can handle everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue.\n\nIt’s not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a cautionary tale. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that records your life and offers companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in equal measure. And now at least two companies, including Sandbar and one helmed by Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand.\n\nThe form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space — your home, your car, even your face — is becoming an interface.\n\nOpenAI’s new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you’re talking, which is something today’s models can’t manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions.\n\nAs The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI’s hardware efforts through the company’s $6.5 billion acquisition in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 18:29:29 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T18:37:45.132212"}

Part of the MCU’s Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings) and Andrew Guest (Hawkeye), with Guest serving as showrunner.\n\nAs previously reported, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars as Simon Williams, aka Wonder Man, an actor and stunt person with actual superpowers who decides to audition for the lead role in a superhero TV series—a reboot of an earlier Wonder Man incarnation. Demetrius Grosse plays Simon’s brother, Eric, aka Grim Reaper; Ed Harris plays Simon’s agent, Neal Saroyan; and Arian Moayed plays P. Clearly, an agent with the Department of Damage Control.

Their four limbs and tail all contact the ground at slow speeds, while they use a hopping gait at higher speeds. Typically, high-speed movements are more energy-intensive than slow-speed motion, but the opposite is true for macropods like kangaroos; somehow the hopping speed and energy cost become uncoupled. According to a paper published in the journal eLife, this may be due to changes in a kangaroo’s posture at higher hopping speeds.\n\nTo investigate their hypothesis, the authors used 3D motion capture and data from force plates to create a 3D musculoskeletal model to analyze the motions of red and grey kangaroos, focusing on how body mass and speed influence three factors during hopping: hindlimb posture, efficiency of movement and associated tendon stress; and the ankles. This revealed that kangaroos adjust their posture so that the hindlimbs are more crouched while hopping, with the ankle joint doing most of the work per hop.

In the initial aftermath of the acquisition, as users fretted over what direction Twitter would take, millions of users hopped over to Mastodon, a fellow microblogging site. As time went on, users would also try out Bluesky, or Instagram’s Threads app — but because Mastodon was founded in 2016, it had years to develop its own identity as more than just an alternate Twitter.\n\nWhat is Mastodon?\n\nMastodon was founded in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or any other popular social media site, Mastodon is a nonprofit, meaning that, ideally, its goal is to benefit the public, rather than shareholders.\n\nMastodon might look like a Twitter clone at first glance, but the underlying system behind the microblogging platform is far more complex. The service is decentralized (no, not in a blockchain way), describing itself as a “federated network which operates in a similar way to email.”\n\nWhen you first create your account, you choose a server — similar to how you choose to open an email account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or wherever — which generates your profile’s address. So, for example, if you sign up for Mastodon via the climate justice server, then your address will be @[your username]@climatejustice.social. But no matter which server you sign up with, you will be able to communicate with users from any other server, just like how Gmail users email Hotmail users and vice versa. However, some servers might have blocked other servers (perhaps if it’s an unsavory group), which would mean you can’t communicate with anyone from the blocked server.\n\nThe Mastodon lingo\n\nMastodon users generally refer to individual communities as “instances” or servers. These Mastodon servers can be run by individuals, groups or organizations that each have their own set of rules regarding how users can sign up, as well as their own moderation policies. Some servers let anyone join, while others are invite-only or require approval by an admin. For example, a server for professional scientists asks applicants to include a link to their research to demonstrate that they are, indeed, professionals.\n\nChoosing which server to register your account with might seem stressful, but it’s possible to move your account later, so don’t worry. Plus, you can follow people regardless of which server they’re on.\n\nYou may also hear Mastodon described as part of the “Fediverse,” or an interconnected web of various social media services. You know how having a Twitter account doesn’t mean you can use that account on Instagram? Through the Fediverse, your single Mastodon account also grants you access to other decentralized social networks, if that interests you.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nYou may ocassionally see Mastodon’s equivalent of tweets being referred to as “toots,” but this is fading out of favor (since it’s kind of silly!). Many people are just calling them “posts” these days, but “toot” is often found referenced in older third-party clients.\n\nMastodon supports a number of Twitter conventions like replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hashtags. For a while, Mastodon made an intentional choice not to make a quote tweet-like feature, since it can encourage dogpiling criticism, but the platform relented and rolled out that feature in 2025.\n\nIn addition, Mastodon lists work slightly differently from Twitter as you can only add people to a list if you’re already following them. And Direct messages on Mastodon are just @username posts, not private messages coming to a DM inbox — just remember to change the visibility settings if you want that message to stay between the two of you.\n\nWhat does it mean that Mastodon is open source?\n\nAnyone can download, modify and install Mastodon on their own server — plus, the developers of the platform don’t own the copyright.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that you can grab Mastodon’s code without acknowledging the source, though. Former President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, initially launched with Mastodon code and passed it off as if it were original software. Mastodon did not take kindly to that.\n\nHow do you create a Mastodon account?\n\nWhen you arrive on the Mastodon website, you can click a button called “create account,” which directs you to a page listing servers to choose from. You can filter these by various factors, like region, language, topic, sign-up speed and more. There, find a server that piques your interest and join — if it’s a server that requires you to be approved, you might need to wait a bit. From there, you can start finding people to follow, regardless of whether they’re registered via your same server.\n\nIn effort to minimize confusion on new users picking a server, Mastodon made changes amid the “Twitter exodus” so that it would easier to create an account. Now, when you go to sign up, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server.\n\nHow do you decide which Mastodon server to join?\n\nMastodon’s website has helpful resources — but it’s still a bit overwhelming and challenging to find a home base that aligns with your interests. Ask friends who are already on Mastodon if they have suggestions! Or just join somewhere random, because you can always change your server affiliation later once you get into the swing of things.\n\nCan you talk to people on other Mastodon servers besides your own?\n\nYes, you can follow people outside of your local server and reply to their posts. However, when you want to follow someone on a different server, you have to enter their username in the search box on your server to find them first, then follow them. You can’t just go to their profile and click the follow button as you would on Twitter.\n\nWhat’s the difference between the Home, Local and Federated timelines?\n\nYour Home timeline shows you posts from people that you follow, similar to Twitter. The Local timeline shows posts from all users in your server, while the Federated timeline shows you all public posts from users that people in your server follow. (Hint: You can turn on “Slow Mode” in Preferences –> Appearance to hide timeline updates behind a click if things are coming at you too fast!)\n\nWhat is Mastodon’s moderation policy?\n\nIndividual server admins set their own moderation policies, so you should read the policy on the server you choose to ensure it matches up with your values.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of Mastodon when compared with Twitter/X?\n\nMastodon’s user base is a fraction of a percentage of the size of Twitter’s user base. It’s also far less intuitive to navigate, since it hasn’t been designed for a massive global audience like Twitter. That could change in time as more developers join the project in the wake of the Twitter takeover.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Mastodon compared with Twitter/X?\n\nWell, for one thing, Mastodon is not owned by Elon Musk… however, it’s going to be difficult in the near-term for Mastodon to replicate the same “watercooler of the world” vibe that Twitter was defined by. Some users might prefer Mastodon to X, though, as it’s more customizable by nature. Unlike X, individual communities have different content guidelines, which provide a variety of different user experiences. And while the user base on Mastodon is smaller, this can lead to more personal and direct conversations, at times, compared with tweeting into the void, so to speak.\n\nIs Mastodon safer than Twitter?\n\nMastodon is what you make of it. Due to its decentralized nature, if you are looking for a more controlled online experience, you can join a server with stricter guardrails against harassment. Some Mastodon features are also built with mitigating harassment in mind. For example, you can only search by hashtag, not by words that appear in a toot. So if you want your post to be discoverable, you can tag it — if you’d rather limit the audience, no one can find your tweet about the Red Sox by simply searching “red sox” if you haven’t tagged it.\n\nHowever, a text-based search can surface the posts you’ve written, favorited, boosted or have been mentioned in, which can be useful.\n\nCan I post images and video?\n\nAs noted above, Mastodon supports many Twitter conventions, but its support for media is more limited. Where Twitter supports a variety of media and other data appended to tweets, including its audio-only social “Spaces,” plus photos, video, GIFs, polls, precise location and experimental “Status” tags, Mastodon simply supports images, videos, audio and polls.\n\nYou can add up to four images to a post, up to eight megabytes in size. Video and audio can be any length, but with a file size limit of 40 megabytes.\n\nCan I post privately to friends?\n\nMastodon offers the ability to set your post’s privacy at the time of writing. Posts can be set to be public to be visible by all; unlisted to make them public but opted out of discovery features; only visible to your followers; or only visible to those users you’ve mentioned.\n\nCan I get verified on Mastodon?\n\nNo. There’s no universal verification system like on Twitter. Some servers may vet their user sign-ups and you can self-verify, in a way, by adding links to your Mastodon profile that have a specific attribute (rel=”me”) in order to prove you are who you say you are.\n\nSome servers are having fun with the idea of verification in a less-than-official fashion. For example, the mstdn.social server lets you add blue-and-white checkmarks and other emoji to your display name if you’d like, which make you look verified, even though these don’t mean anything. (Sort of like Twitter’s new verification system! But for free!)\n\nIs Mastodon here to stay?\n\nAs of summer 2025, Mastodon has under one million monthly active users, and around 10 million registered users — this is to say, Mastodon is much smaller than X which had an estimated 132 million daily active users. Still, not all social networks are created equal, and you might find that you prefer tooting about TTRPGs in a dedicated server, as opposed to tweeting into a realm of madness. Or, you might find that this decentralized system is confusing, and you’ll just ride out the Muskening on X, or switch to Bluesky, Threads, or something else entirely. Choose your own adventure!\n\nI’m not sure I want to leave X. Can I cross-post from X to Mastodon?\n\nYes, this is possible by way of third-party tools. These require you to authorize your account with Twitter and Mastodon and set up parameters. We’ve had success with Moa Party, which allows you to get specific as to which tweets or retweets are cross-posted. But other tools are available, including Mastodon Twitter Crossposter, which is also available here on GitHub.\n\nCan I find my Twitter friends on Mastodon?\n\nYes, this is also possible with third-party tools. We’ve seen many Mastodon users trying out tools like Fedifinder, Twitodon and Debirdify, for example.\n\nDoes Mastodon work with Bluesky and Threads?\n\nIt’s a no for Bluesky — not unless Bluesky chooses to adopt the ActivityPub protocol Mastodon uses. But Bluesky is not planning to integrate with ActivityPub, having decided to build its own networking protocol. There is some skepticism among the developer and open source community about whether or not Bluesky’s decision to go its own way is really about its own protocol’s advantages or if it’s more about producing a spec it could eventually control.\n\nThere are many existing protocols for decentralizing discourse, including ActivityPub, SSB, Matrix, & RSS. Each of these are successful in their own right, but none of them fully met the goals we had for a network that enables global long-term public conversations at scale. — Bluesky (@bluesky) April 6, 2022\n\nThreads, however, supports ActivityPub.

Whether you’re looking to get one for yourself, buying a last-minute holiday gift, or exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.\n\nWith its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.\n\nDespite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice.\n\nWhile the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more.\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nAlthough it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller.\n\nOf course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need.\n\nWe’ll walk you through the similarities and differences between the two smart watches to help inform your decision.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

If you use a LegalZoom promo code right now, you will get a discount on the service.\n\nI found it super easy to set up my LLC, and after about $500 and 30 minutes of my time, I was off to the races with an LLC for my band. I did make the mistake of spelling my co-bandleader’s middle name as his last name (I blame his wrongly named Instagram handle for this), so I had to toss them another $129 to fix that. My bad.\n\nSave on top services at LegalZoom, like LLC registration, incorporation, estate plans, and more with coupons and deals from WIRED below.\n\nGet 10% Off LLC Formation With Our LegalZoom Coupon Code\n\nIf you’re in need of basic legal services like establishing an LLC, estate planning, or other contract-based services, LegalZoom offers a very simple interface that is shockingly easy to use. I am a luddite when it comes to understanding legal jargon and steps in a process like establishing my band’s LLC, but LegalZoom’s simple interface made it shockingly easy to make sure everything was in order.\n\nIf you use our exclusive code for 10% off LLC Formations (found in the table above), you’ll get a nice chunk of change off the cost of setting up your small business. As you’ll read below, it’s not especially cheap to do this, even digitally, in many states. There are mandatory filing fees and other fees that can range from a few hundred to many hundreds of dollars. Take the discount!\n\nLegalZoom Business Formation: Start Today Using Our LegalZoom Discounts\n\nLegalZoom services expand well beyond just helping establish personal LLCs, there are also other business formations that LegalZoom can help with. Some of these include Limited Liability Company LLCs, which start at free, plus state filing fees. This is the simplest, flexible way to ensure your business protects any personal assets. There’s also Corporation (S corp or C corp), which starts at $149 plus state filing fees. This is a more complex structured formation, with the ability to issue shares, go public, or go global. There’s also help for Nonprofit (501c3) LLCs, which starts at $99 plus state filing fees. This one is designed to support a public or social benefit that’s eligible for tax breaks.

This 4K 240Hz monitor is a favorite among PC gamers, even among the huge amounts of OLED options out there. It can hit a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits in HDR, bringing scenes in games to life in vivid detail.\n\nOr if you’re on the other side of the budget spectrum and just need something basic, we recommend checking out one of HP’s 27-inch 1080p monitors, such as the HP V27i G5, which typically retails for $209. It even comes with a 75Hz refresh rate, a small but appreciated bump over the standard 60Hz. We have HP coupon codes to help you save on all this tech and even more below.\n\n$20 Off Your First Order With Our HP Promo Code\n\nHP offers a $20 discount right off the top of your order if it’s your first time buying from HP.com. While you can’t use it in addition to the other coupons, it might be a better discount if you’re purchasing something less expensive. To get this HP promo code, your order has to be $65 or more though (before taxes and shipping), and it requires signing up for the HP newsletter.\n\nThis HP promo code is valid for a month after subscribing to the newsletter and is restricted to one per customer. If you aren’t planning to spend too much and it’s your first time buying from HP.com, this could be the way to go.\n\nTop HP Coupons: Laptops for Work, School, and Everyday Use\n\nOne of the best laptops for work is the HP ProBook 4 G1, which is now only $501, a whopping 78% discount. We love the HP ZBook Fury 16 G11 Mobile Workstation PC for school, now $1,509 at 63% off, and a great laptop for everyday use is the HP Laptop 17t-cn300, now only $300 (66% off).\n\nHP Instant Ink: Get 50% Off With This HP Deal\n\nPrinters are super handy, but one of the most annoying and expensive investments you make for it is the upkeep of ink and toner. Well, the good news is that you can save up to 50% on ink right now! With HP Instant Ink, you can save time and money with this subscription service that automatically delivers ink only when you're running low, with plans starting at less than $2 a month.\n\nSave 40% on Tech With the HP Student Discount\n\nIf you’re a student—or a parent to a student, teacher, school faculty, or university staff member—you’re in luck. HP is offering a serious 40% off discount on all kinds of tech, including laptops, desktop PCs, printers, and accessories. All stuff you’ll need for school, of course.\n\nHP rebranded its laptops in 2024, introducing the OmniBooks into the world, including the premium HP OmniBook Ultra Flip. Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips and a killer OLED display, the OmniBook Ultra Flip would be a great laptop for college thanks to its long-lasting battery life, especially with a 40% discount for students or teachers.\n\nIt’s not just laptops though. The HP Education Program discount applies to desktop PCs, printers, and tons more qualifying products.\n\nHP Military Discount: Get 40% Off the Latest Tech\n\nHP offers more than just a standard military discount. The company’s exclusive military discount is extended to support active service members, veterans, and their families, but also healthcare workers and First Responders.\n\nIf you belong to any of those groups, the HP military discount will drop the retail prices significantly, whether you’re searching for a new laptop, PC, mouse, and many more select products at HP.com.\n\nMore HP Discounts on Gaming PCs and Free Games\n\nHP’s high-performance gaming laptops and PCs are also included in this coupon code. HP has two brands of gaming laptops to choose from: the more affordable Victus and the higher-end Omen (both of which have been reviewed by me here). Finding a gaming laptop under $1,000 can be tricky, especially since you’ll want something that doesn’t use a 5-year old GPU and only 8 GB of memory. That’s why I’d avoid the cheapest Victus laptop here, and bump up to at least the Victus 16t-r100. That gets you an RTX 4050 and 16 GB of RAM, despite costing only $150 more.\n\nMeanwhile, the higher-end Omen models get you access to the new RTX 50-series graphics cards, and the new multi-frame generation feature that’s got everyone talking. They also come with a 16-inch 1920 x 1200 screen with a 240Hz refresh rate, such as the Omen Max gaming laptop.\n\nBeyond gaming laptops, HP gaming desktops like the opulent Omen 45L may also be discounted. Like the Omen Max laptops, the Omen 45L comes with RTX 50-series graphics. There’s tons of bundle promotions for discounts on gaming gear, like the HyperX Cloud Alpha wireless gaming headset and HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 wireless gaming mouse for 30% off—a total of $88 in savings.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 06:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T06:47:20.883357"}

The investor interest has taken shape in the latest all-equity Series D round from GEF [&#8230;]", "content": "Arya.ag, an Indian agritech company offering storage facilities near farms and offering lending services to hundreds of thousands of farmers, has drawn investor interest and remained profitable even as global crop prices continue to fall in a volatile commodities market.\n\nThe investor interest has taken shape in the latest all-equity Series D round from GEF Capital Partners, totaling $81 million, of which more than 70% was primary capital and the rest secondary share sales, according to the company.\n\nGlobally, agricultural commodity prices are falling. Risks from extreme weather, input costs, trade disruptions, and biofuel policy shifts continue to weigh on agricultural markets, the World Bank has warned. This leaves businesses exposed to price swings and inventory losses. Nonetheless, Arya.ag says it is navigating the worst of that strain by steering clear of direct commodity bets and using a model that it says helps absorb shocks from downward pricing shifts.\n\nFounded in 2013 by former ICICI Bank executives Prasanna Rao, Anand Chandra, and Chattanathan Devarajan, Arya.ag is built around a simple idea: giving farmers more control over when and to whom they sell their crops. The Noida-based startup offers storage close to farms while allowing farmers to borrow against warehoused grain to meet immediate cash needs and connecting them with a wider pool of buyers — from agri-corporations to processors and millers — helping them avoid the pressure to sell just after harvest, when prices are often weakest.\n\nThe company operates at scale, which sets Arya.ag apart from traditional lenders, banks, and other agribusiness platforms. The startup says it aggregates and stores about $3 billion worth of grain each year — roughly 3% of national output — and facilitates around $1.5 billion in loans annually, while keeping its rate of bad loans (known as gross non-performing assets, or NPAs) below 0.5% despite the recent drop in prices.\n\nArya.ag lends only a portion of the value of stored grain and tracks prices closely, triggering margin calls when required rather than taking losses itself, Rao said. Borrowers can respond by repaying part of the loan or adding more grain as collateral.\n\n“You’re not immune to risks,” Rao told TechCrunch. “But because your lending is completely secured against commodities, it will never happen that the prices will fall by 90%. You already have a margin of 30%, and with your mark to market, you’ve been able to control your NPAs and defaults.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nIn the year ended March 2025, Arya.ag generated net revenue of ₹4.5 billion (around $50 million), with first-half revenue in the current financial year rising about 30% from a year earlier to ₹3 billion ($33.3 million). Profit after tax stood at ₹340 million (about $3.78 million) last year, and has risen a further 39% so far this year, Rao said.\n\nArya.ag Co-founder and CEO Prasanna Rao Image Credits:Arya.ag\n\nArya.ag says it now reaches between 850,000 and 900,000 farmers across 60% of India’s districts, operating through a network of about 12,000 agricultural warehouses, all leased from third parties. The startup generates revenue from farmers for storage, from banks for originating loans against stored grain, and from buyers for facilitating crop sales through its platform.\n\nStorage remains the largest contributor, accounting for about 50–55% of total revenue, while finance contributes 25–30% and the rest comes from commerce, Rao said.\n\nArya.ag disburses more than ₹110 billion (about $1.2 billion) in loans to farmers each year through its platform. Between ₹25 billion and ₹30 billion (roughly $278 million–$333 million) of that comes from its own balance sheet via its non-banking finance arm, Rao said, with the rest originated for partner banks.\n\nArya.ag’s loans carry interest rates of about 12.5% to 12.8%, well below the 24% to 36% typically charged by commission agents, Rao said, though higher than bank lending rates of around 11% to 12%. He added that banks generally do not lend in the small, local markets close to farming areas that Arya serves, where loan sizes are a fraction of typical bank tickets and borrowers are often located far from formal branches.\n\nThe startup approves loans in under five minutes with disbursements handled almost entirely digitally, Rao said.\n\nTechnology plays a central role in how Arya.ag manages risk and scale.

{"title": "What Is the ‘Super Flu’ That Is Spreading in Europe and the United States?", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-super-flu-spreading-in-united-states-europe/", "summary": "The “super flu” behind outbreaks in the US and UK is a new variant of influenza A H3N2, subclade K. Existing vaccines appear to be insufficiently effective against the virus.", "content": "The spread of influenza became more severe this fall, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated the 2024-25 flu season as the most severe season since 2017-18. In the UK, the spread has begun earlier than at any time since 2003-04.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, some media outlets have begun using the term “super flu.” However, this term is not an official medical term. The actual name is “subclade K,” a new variant of influenza A H3N2.\n\nThis variant has multiple mutations in a protein on the surface of the virus called hemagglutinin, making it antigenically different from the variants used in existing vaccines. This allows it to partially evade immunity acquired through previous infection or vaccines, making people more susceptible to infection. Genetic analysis by the UK Health Security Agency has revealed that 87 percent of H3N2 viruses detected since late August 2025 are subclade K.\n\nThe Outbreak Began Earlier Than Usual\n\nThe term “super flu” is not necessarily scientifically accurate. The H3N2 strain already caused severe illness in the elderly and children, and the new mutant strain has not made it more deadly. Contrary to the name, the virus's inherent danger is said to be no different from the conventional H3N2 strain.\n\nIn 2025, the US influenza pandemic peaked in early February, with active epidemics occurring in 87.3 percent of the country. For 11 consecutive weeks, more than 50 percent of the country recorded high epidemic levels, an anomaly that led to 287 child deaths. However, these figures reflect the scale of the epidemic and do not imply an increase in the lethality of the virus itself.\n\nThe influenza epidemic is hitting earlier this year in many parts of the world. While the usual peak in Japan occurs between late December and February, in 2025 the epidemic began in earnest at the end of September. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, of the 23 H3 virus strains collected in Japan between September and November 5 that could be analyzed, 22 were subclade K.\n\nThe reason for the early outbreak is thought to be the decline in immunity of the population due to the countermeasures against new coronavirus infection (Covid-19), as well as a decline in physical strength due to the record-breaking heat wave. During the three years of the coronavirus pandemic, the influenza epidemic was largely suppressed. As a result, it is possible that population immunity to the virus was reduced. In fact, with the 2024 influenza pandemic in Australia at its highest level since 19 years, it would not be surprising to see a similar trend in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nExisting Vaccines Are Effective\n\nThere has also been much interest in vaccine efficacy in the face of this virulent strain. The vaccine for the 2025-26 season is based on the conventional J.2 lineage (subclade), which has different antigenicity from subclade K. However, early data from the UK has confirmed that 70-75 percent of vaccinated children and 30-40 percent of adults did not end up visiting the emergency room or being hospitalized after infection. This means that even if the antigenicity is not completely identical, the vaccine remains effective in preventing severe illness.\n\nThe basic prevention measures are the same as for conventional influenza. Vaccination is recommended from October to November before the epidemic, and the effect appears about two weeks after vaccination. It is particularly recommended for people aged 65 and over, people with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, children aged 6 months to 5 years, and medical workers. In daily life, it is effective to thoroughly wash and disinfect your hands, and wear a mask when in crowds. Ventilation in rooms and maintaining appropriate humidity levels are also important in suppressing viral activity.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T10:30:15.350581"}

The phones are assembled at a factory in Bocholt belonging to Gigaset, a company that has been making smartphones on German soil since 2018.

This was not a one-off episode; it followed the deployment of federal troops into multiple Democratic-led cities, prompting lawsuits and court challenges that local leaders described, with justification, as militarized intimidation.\n\nexpired: police cooperating with protesters tired: police using controversial crowd-control tactics wired: police confronting protesters for content Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nLos Angeles provided an early template. After protests erupted in June over an increase in aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, President Donald Trump ordered roughly 4,000 federalized National Guard troops into the city and activated about 700 US Marines. At the same time, he signaled—online and through traditional media—a willingness to escalate even further by invoking the Insurrection Act. Troops stood shoulder to shoulder with long guns and riot shields as smoke canisters and crowd-control munitions blanketed highways and city streets, a posture nominally framed as deescalation and for the protection of federal property but calibrated to provoke confrontation.\n\nInside the Pentagon, officials rushed to draft domestic use-of-force guidance for Marines that contemplated temporary civilian detention—an unusually explicit entry into a legal gray area, paired with a highly visible show of force.\n\nBy August, the federal government shifted from episodic deployment to direct control: Trump placed Washington, DC’s police department under federal authority and deployed roughly 800 National Guard troops, exploiting the district’s unique legal vulnerability. The Washington Post described the city as a “laboratory for a militarized approach.”\n\nThe administration’s rhetoric was not subtle—Trump cast the crackdown as an image project, calling Washington a “wasteland for the world to see,” and openly endorsing fear as a policing tactic, urging officers to “knock the hell out of them.” City leaders countered that the supposed emergency was manufactured, noting that crime in the capital was at multi-decade lows. In city after city, “restoring order” became a flimsy euphemism for preemptive displays of force aimed at deterring dissent before it reached the streets.\n\nAcross Chicagoland, protest control became overtly choreographed. As “Operation Midway Blitz” intensified in September, officials erected barricades and “protest zones” around the Broadview ICE facility. State police in riot gear lined perimeters, while federal agents repeatedly fired tear gas and other projectiles into crowds, according to videos and witness accounts. The most brazen moment came when homeland security secretary Kristi Noem appeared on the facility’s roof beside armed agents and a camera crew, positioned near a sniper’s post, as arrests unfolded below.\n\nThis was performative policing at its most distilled: public safety reduced to a spectacle with vaguely defined urban threats cast as the danger being neutralized. The absurdity of the displays allowed routine acts of disorderly conduct to be perceived as folk-hero moments.\n\nThis performative turn didn’t emerge from nowhere. It displaced a quieter, less theatrical—but still controlling—model that had dominated US protest policing for decades. Policing scholars refer to it as strategic incapacitation: a practice whereby conditions are shaped so that protests can’t become effective in the first place.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T11:23:47.247145"}

{"title": "10 Best Meal Delivery Services, Tested by an Ex-Restaurant Critic", "link": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-meal-kit-services-1/", "summary": "Here are the best meal kits in 2026, from Martha Stewart’s meal kit to the best meal delivery on a budget.", "content": "Frequently Asked Questions Are Meal Delivery Services Worth It? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron If you're talking raw materials by the pound—meat, zucchini, rice, noodles—meal kits will of course cost more than buying food at grocery stores. It's a service, after all, with added value above simple ingredient cost. Unless you've got quite expensive taste, you'll easily be able to make delicious meals at home for less than the $7 to $14 a serving that a meal kit will cost. But this said, this doesn't necessarily mean that meal kits are expensive for what they offer. I conducted an experiment, trying to re-create four different meal-kit meals by going to my local grocery store—buying every ingredient provided by the meal kit. Turns out, if you don't have the right sauces and spices at home already, it's very difficult to recreate these tasty meals at grocery stores for less than they cost from a meal kit, in part because you'll most likely have to buy full containers of sauces and spice instead of pre-portioned ingredients, So, is HelloFresh worth it compared to a grocery store? Caveats are in order: For staple ingredients and spices you'll use on multiple recipes, the grocery store is of course cheaper. Once you buy a container of paprika for an individual recipe, it'll also be there for future recipes, whereas meal-kit spices are portioned for the meal. So the real answer is that meal kits can be a quite economical way of trying out a new recipe, or a new style of cooking, without larding up your fridge with condiments you won't use again. For ingredients you'd use less commonly, a meal kit can reduce waste and spoilage, and maybe even compete on price for an individual meal. If your comparison point is takeout, well, the best meal delivery services on this list will almost certainly be cheaper and more nutritious. I've found that a meal kit in the fridge tends to be a good motivator to cook a nutritive meal—and thus can save me both the money and the cholesterol. To really save on cost, some people like to keep testing out the trial offers and discounts. Much like mattress-in-a-box companies, meal-kit companies usually have a running promotion. Usually this takes the form of a trial discount price that'll drop your cost by half or more on the first box, in hopes you'll like the service enough to keep it on at full price. For me, a meal kit a few times a week ends up balancing out well: It's a motivating factor to eat better, and it means that when I do go to the grocery store, I can do so less mindlessly and more purposefully, since I've always got a few meals' worth of ingredients in the fridge. It's also had the side effect of broadening my culinary toolkit, keeping me from getting stuck in the same ruts. That said, you know: It's a set grocery expense and not necessarily a small one. I do get tired of tossing or recycling cold packs and boxes. And depending on time of year, I often prefer shopping in person for what's seasonal and local, when produce is at its peak—an experience you don't get from a meal kit, or from grocery delivery for that matter. If you're cooking for a bigger household, meal kits can also lose their utility quite quickly. A convenient option for two can become a much larger expense for a family of four or six. What If I Take a Trip Out of Town? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Pretty much every meal kit I've tested has an option to pause subscriptions—and there's no particular limit to how often you can do this. The main thing is to be sure that you've canceled with enough lead time. Some services let you cancel or pause delivery as late as the Friday before a Monday delivery. HelloFresh requires five days' notice. Some, like Hungryroot, may lock in next week's order as early as the previous Monday, depending on where you live. Read your terms of service, and act accordingly. How to Optimize Meal Kits AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Don't order too many meals per week: You know the old John Lennon line: Life is what happens when you're busy out eating a random burrito, then thinking guiltily about the meal kit at home in your fridge. Aspirations are great, but don't order more meals than you're likely to make, or you'll be sad. Err on the side of caution. Order just enough meals per week that making yourself a recipe from your HelloFresh or Home Chef box is still a delight and a convenience and an overall boon to your life—not an obligation. For me, a somewhat improvisational and impulsive person, three meals a week is the sweet spot. The prospect of a few easy meals usually saves me from an impulse weeknight DoorDash.\" Make room in your fridge: Meal kits take the place of a lot of grocery shopping. But they're also a lot of food, and a lot to keep organized. What I like to do is clear a tall enough space in my fridge to put the whole meal kit box in the fridge, after pulling out the cold packs: This way, I'm not left worrying about which groceries belong to the meal kit, and I won't lose any ingredients. I can just pull the whole box out when I want to make a meal. That said, some plans like Home Chef, HelloFresh, and Green Chef are very good at organizing each meal into its own separate bag. An added bonus from these more organized plans is that you'll be able to use less space in your fridge. Over time, this will matter. Check the recipe cards to make sure you have everything you need to make a recipe: Most meal kits expect that you'll have certain staple ingredients in your home, usually including oil and butter. Recipes also have requirements for cookware. Check this before you start a recipe. Nothing worse than realizing you need an absentee stick of butter on step 5, with carrots already browning in the toaster oven. Remember, you owe nothing to the recipe: Meal kit services hire lovely recipe developers, of course. And on the best meal kits, these chefs have spent a lot of time optimizing each recipe. But you owe them nothing—nothing! Add spices, change steps, season food when you want to season it. Meal kits can teach you a lot about how to make a good meal, and shake you out of tired culinary routines. But it's your meal. Make it how you like. Have fun. How Do We Test Meal Kits? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Chances are, wherever you are, whatever week it is, I'm testing a meal kit right now. I constantly cycle among various meal kits, testing and retesting each of my top picks at least once a year—and often multiple times per year. I order at least four meals from each when possible, and prepare meals according to instructions and see how well it goes. I check my own prep times against the advertised prep times (rarely an exercise in honesty!), and take note of any inconsistencies, vagueness, or frustration in the recipe card instructions. If you needlessly recommend a nonstick pan, I like you less, especially if you tell me I should heat said pan before adding food—or you later make mention of browned fond in the recipe. Nonstick isn't cast iron or carbon, there's no fond. I check for the quality and freshness of the produce, and do the same for the meat. Where possible, I also look into where the meat was sourced, and check on the reputation, safety, and standards of the meat suppliers. If a meal kit swears it's gluten-free, I check on this—calling certifying organizations where relevant. I usually try to order as varied a menu a possible, checking in on gluten-free meals, a seafood item, a vegetarian item, and white and dark meat item—as well as meals that draw (or attempt to draw) from onspirations all over the globe. Sometimes, I test the same meal kit multiple times for different dietary needs, and our vegan tester, Molly Higgins, often tests the same meal kit I do but with a different focus.\n\nMore Meal Kits We Liked\n\nSunbasket Chicken and Greek Orzo Photograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nSunbasket (~$14 per serving): Sunbasket is a plan that focuses heavily on fresh, organic ingredients, and offers a whole lot of variety and good cooking techniques, including deglazing and attentiveness to saucing. And like Hungryroot, it also offers breakfasts and snacks to supplement meal options with little extras like coconut yogurt and sous-vide egg bites. The meal kit also lets you filter out allergen-containing items. My colleague Louryn Strampe loved the flexibility and add-ons (and even some crickets!) On my most recent test, I enjoyed in particular an excellent Greek chicken and orzo salad dish—and wonder of wonders, the advertised prep time was actually the actual prep time (about 30 minutes). The focus on organic ingredients does make Sunbasket one of the more expensive meal kit options. The annual Thankgiving meal kit is a lovely and welcome extravagance at $200, and can be ordered until 8 days before Thanksgiving.\n\nDinnerly Meal Kit Photograph: Matthew Korfhage; Getty Images\n\nDinnerly ($6 to $9 per serving): Marley Spoon's lower-cost meal kit, Dinnerly was long WIRED's budget pick. Frankly, it's still a good affordable pick. It's also a stolidly meat-and-potatoes pick, and often straightforwardly Midwestern in its recipes. The proteins are generous and of excellent quality, and the produce is fresh. The meals are balanced. But the recipe development and instructions weren't quite up to Marley Spoon standards on my most recent test of the kit, though I did love the middle-American trashiness and hold-my-beer inventiveness of a “Reuben meatloaf” stuffed with sauerkraut and caraway seeds. This year I ended up preferring the meals I tried from EveryPlate, which has the further merit of being a buck cheaper a meal.\n\nFactor (~$14 a serving): Factor is a prepared meal delivery plan run by HelloFresh, with ready-to-eat meals that look a lot like TV dinners. But there's a twist: They've never been frozen. They were made fresh in a commissary kitchen, and shipped out with cold packs. It's kinda like restaurant leftovers. This means that proteins in particular often maintain their texture quite well, including a chimichurri filet mignon I couldn't believe I microwaved. Some meals, especially carb-avoidant or keto meals, are oddly mushy. But meals centered on proteins and whole starches like potatoes or rice, alongside veggies like green beans or brussels sprouts, tended to fare quite well. So did stir-fry-style meals. In fact, a recent test of Factor's high protein plan was my favorite experience with the meal kit, and included wild rice and excellent pork loin. I do wish they'd shed their reliance on the microwave, however: When I went off-script and used a toaster oven or the Ninja Crispi air fryer, I had much better results than with the nuker. Like many ready-to-eat meals, it's a bit more expensive than the kits you cook yourself.\n\nFuel Meals Photograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nFuel Meals ($13 to $14 a serving): Fuel Meals are not the cheapest option among meal delivery that arrives frozen; it's about the same price as fresh, never-frozen meals from Factor and CookUnity. But I found that Fuel fulfills a specific niche as well as any prepared meal plans I found. It excels at no-nonsense, no-fluff, no-added-ingredients, pure protein-packed nutritive meals. Some of Fuel's meals had as few as five ingredients, consisting of essentially the macro nutrients themselves plus a modicum of oil and salt. A large percentage of meals are marked gluten-free or dairy-free. Does all this mean less flavor? It can. The meals are also often not beautiful, dominated by a large and no-nonsense serving of protein. But Fuel's meal service offers an admirable focus, especially for those bulking up or watching carbs. Meals are substantive, usually topping 600 calories and 40 grams of protein without added sugar or fatty dairy or carb-heavy filler. I feel like if I wore tank tops more often, this is what I'd eat.\n\nWildgrain Photograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nWildgrain ($13 to $17 per loaf or box of pastries): This is less a meal than a way to step up a home meal. Wildgrain is a monthly delivery bread box: You receive par-baked bread and pastries baked at small bakeries all over the country. This is pretty much the same process that likely happens at local restaurants, when your warm bread basket comes out: It's not quite as high-quality as you'd get direct from an artisan bakery, if you live in places with artisan bakeries. But it's also as fresh as it gets, and I had a very good experience testing the box in October 2025, in particular, with sourdough breads perfect for large meals with houseguests. You finish the baking at home, so what you have at the end is ultra-fresh baked bread, biscuits, doughnuts, or scones that are still warm and crisp from the oven. A Wildgrain subscription arrives as a monthly box, filled with four, six, or 12 items that might range from a full sourdough loaf or fresh-made pasta to a pack of six doughnuts or four large croissants. Basically, you build your own box each month, choosing from among healthy sourdough or pasta and decadent pastries.\n\nThistle ($13 to $16 per serving): A prior top pick for solo diners, Thistle is mostly a plant-based meal kit—but there's a $3 option to add sustainable meats to any otherwise vegan meal. It's also so local and seasonal that the West and East coasts have different menus, and the whole middle of the country, except Chicago gets none. (You can check your zip code here to see if you can get delivery.) WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has used Thistle as a means to get herself to eat more vegetables, and thus avoid a life of rickets and/or scurvy. But especially, it's friendly to the solo diner, with individually prepared meals with low to no prep. Portions are generous enough to split among meals, and in a nice turn for those who hate having to dispose of boxes, Thistle's drivers will pick up the cooler bag that housed last week's meal and replace it with a new one full of food. Vegan tester Molly Higgins' favorite meals from Thistle were a whirlwind of textures, including a Mexican-inspired corn and poblano chile salad with adobo pinto beans and a chilled lemongrass-accented rice noodle bowl that mixed spice, tang, crisply fresh veggies, and deep umami from mushrooms and seaweed. She still dreams about it sometimes.\n\nTovala Photograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nTovala (~$13 a serving): It's not every day you get to try something that feels so new. Tovala offers perhaps the most ambitious solution to ready-to-heat and prepared meal delivery I've seen: The meal kits come with an oven! In contrast to the sogginess of many prepared meals, Tovala's recipes come in little foil pans with recipes custom-designed for a little steam oven. The results are often delicious, especially a recent sweet chili-glazed salmon with pickled veg and noodles, and the QR code scanning function makes each recipe seamless to cook. Stick with the meal plan for six weeks, and in the bargain you get a quite affordable and powerful little convection oven, toaster, and steamer. Tovala is best as a solution for the solo diner: Meals aren't big enough for couples, and servings are one at a time.\n\nGobble Steak Vierge Photograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nGobble ($12 to $17 a serving): Gobble was our prior top pick for fast-cooked meals, in part because its speed-demon meals also offered interesting and worldly flavors. Indeed, our most recent test included Caribbean rondon, an Indonesian peanut curry stir-fry, and steak vierge. But while the flavors have stayed interesting, the focus on fast cooking appears to have waned since my colleague Louryn Strampe tested Gobble—and cook time estimates aren't printed on the recipe cards. I'm still in the process of re-testing this kit, but for now Hungryroot has taken the fast-cooking crown. For small households, Gobble is also among the most expensive kits. Ordering fewer than eight meals a week costs $15+ per serving.\n\nNurture Life ($6 to $8 per serving): Nurture Life is like a restaurant kids' menu, in ready-to-eat meal kit form. We loved the idea behind this fresh-made, never-frozen delivery meal plan when we tested it a few years back: a bunch of toddler- and slightly bigger kid-friendly meals, from mac and cheese to spaghetti and meatballs to myriad variations on the chicken nugget. The meal prices have dipped to reasonable levels of late, meaning it's likely due for a re-test—and each contains vegetables alongside the greatest hits.\n\nVeestro ($13+ per serving): WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe enjoyed Veestro as a ready-to-eat vegan option, with premade meals delivered fresh, but with freezable options so you can have extra meals on hand in a pinch. The service offers a number of filters for other dietary requirements, and satisfying taste and texture—not always a guarantee on ready-to-eat meals.\n\nSplendid Spoon ($9 to $13 per serving): Splendid Spoon is a nutrition delivery kit that offers a plethora of plant-based smoothies, soups, bowls, noodles, and shots. Everything here is natural, plant-based, and free of gluten or GMOs, including spaghetti and plant-based “meatballs.” WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe has a big yen for the smoothies in particular ($10 apiece), but wasn't quite prepared for the intensity of a lemon juice shot that comes as part of a five-pack of dense 3-ounce superfoods.\n\nModify Health's Braised Beef (top) and Paprika Salmon (bottom) Photograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nModifyHealth ($10 to $13 per serving): The idea behind ModifyHealth is that food can be medicine. Sometimes, I'll admit, it tasted like it—or at least, it tasted like food designed purely for nutrition rather than flavor. ModifyHealth is a prepared meal delivery service tailored to people who need a heart-healthy, low-carb, or low-FODMAP diet to avoid dire digestive or health consequences. GLP-1 weight loss plans are also available, for diabetics or others. Gluten-free meals are attested to be made in an entirely gluten-free facility. The meals were simple, benign, and low-sodium, but also sometimes a little soggy—a common problem with prepared meals. The plastic top of the packaging was also difficult to disengage from the base of each meal tray, a problem when the plastic is hot after a turn in the microwave. But here's what I do like: The meals are carefully tailored with consultation from dieticians, to help people for whom food can be a source of fear or pain. An additional service, offering one-on-one dietitian consultation, can be covered by many insurance plans. ModifyHealth also offers a free consultation for those just trying to figure out which diet plan is right for them. For those with IBS in particular, this remains the most focused food plan I've seen.\n\nDaily Harvest (prices vary): Daily Harvest is another ready-to-eat meal delivery service specializing in dietary restrictions plant-based, gluten- and dairy-free. Smoothies feature, as do harvest bowls, pastas, and grains. Calories are low. Ingredients are often inventive. The meal's a lifesaver for the solo vegan eater without time to prep a meal, and WIRED vegan reviewer Molly Higgins appreciated that the meals mostly relied on the natural flavors of the vegetables themselves, accented with flavors like curry and lemongrass. As with a lot of frozen meals, however, texture wasn't a strong suit.\n\nMeal Kits We Didn't Like\n\nSakara Life ($30+ per serving), Sakara Life offers plant-based weekly menus in fresh, prepared portions, with greens, flavorful sauces, all-organic ingredients, and textural add-ons like seeds or berries. But it's among the most expensive meal plans we've tested, and neither WIRED reviewer who tried it has really cottoned to the thing. Tester Louryn Strampe questioned the science on health claims for detoxes and cleanses, while calling Sakara “egregiously expensive” and full of “bitter veggies and tart fruits.” Vegan tester Molly Higgins, meanwhile, said Sakara Life's tinctures and metabolism supplements didn't agree with her system, and that the mostly raw-food plan made her long for “human food.”\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage; Getty Images\n\nDiet-to-Go ($10 to $14 per serving, plus shipping): Diet-to-Go predates the modern meal kit. Founded more than 30 years ago in Virginia, it's a diet plan much in the tradition of Jenny Craig, offering low-calorie microwaveable, healthy meals meant to act as total meal replacement. Keto and diabetes-friendly options exist, though the most popular “Balance” plan is geared toward weight loss, with calories limited to 1,600 a day for men and a mere 1,200 for women. Anyway, as is often true with microwaved meals that may or may not arrive frozen (it depends on the season, and where you are), proteins and starches fared better than veggies, which tended to be limp and soggy. Meals were healthy, but not always flavorful, and there were a few real misses.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Recent research reveals how much time you should spend walking on a daily basis to prevent it.", "content": "Chronic back pain is a serious health issue affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is not uncommon for back pain to significantly impair quality of life, forcing people to take time off work or undergoing long-term treatment. Furthermore, the cumulative medical costs can place a strain on people's lives financially.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, research that provides scientific support for measures to prevent back pain have been eagerly awaited. While it is widely known that exercise is good for overall health, specific evidence regarding the prevention of lower back pain is limited. In particular, it has long been unclear how effective simple daily actions can be.\n\nA recent large-scale study conducted by Norwegian researchers clearly shows the numerical impact of differences in walking habits on lower back pain risk: \"People who walk more than 100 minutes every day have a 23 percent lower risk of lower back problems than those who walk 78 minutes or less,\" explains Rayane Haddadj, a doctoral researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) specializing in public health.\n\nWalking Time With the Greatest Effect\n\nHadaj and his team conducted a large-scale, four-year follow-up study of 11,194 adults (average age 55) who participated in the Norwegian Trøndelag Health Study (a cohort study of residents of Trøndelag) and who were free of chronic lower back pain at the start of the study.\n\nThe study involved participants wearing accelerometers on their thighs and hips to collect data on walking time and speed over a one-week period, and then annually assessing whether they had experienced back pain lasting three months or more in the past year.\n\nThe results showed that walking time is more important than walking speed in preventing back pain. While brisk walking also has some effect, it is the total amount of time walked per day that has the greatest impact on preventive effects. Those who walked 78 to 100 minutes per day had a 13 percent lower risk of back pain, those who walked 101 to 124 minutes a day had a 23 percent lower risk, and those who walked 125 minutes or more had a 24 percent lower risk.\n\nThese findings demonstrate that anyone can easily take measures to prevent back pain. No special equipment or expensive training is required; simply increasing the amount of time you walk in your daily life can potentially prevent it. Anyone can easily take up the challenge, even elderly people and those who don't normally exercise, as long as they put in the time.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T11:42:08.219856"}

We’ll be there to see all the new product demos we can and to bring you the most exciting news from the show. Follow our coverage for a preview of all the new tech these companies are planning to launch in 2026.\n\nExpect to see the usual suspects: laptops, smart home gadgets, and TVs, and a whole lot more wearables and health tech. We’re anticipating seeing more products with AI integration. Also, robots. Perhaps, humanoids even.\n\nFollow along with CES 2026 Read all the announcements live from CES 2026. Read\n\nCES 2026 officially starts on Tuesday, January 6th, but stay tuned for news and announcements starting Sunday ahead of the show floor opening, when there are also lots of press conferences. Here are the major beats we’re expecting to see at the show.\n\nLaptops\n\nIntel’s upcoming Panther Lake chip was preannounced in October. Image: Intel\n\nLaptops are always big at CES, with most major companies — save for Apple — announcing new models. They range from iterative spec bumps to whole new designs. Plus, there’s always the occasional concept that may or may never come out.\n\nCES 2026 should bring new laptops featuring three new chips: Intel’s Panther Lake, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2, and AMD’s rumored “Gorgon Point” processors. Intel and Qualcomm are hyping up the efficiency of their new chips while simultaneously emphasizing graphics power — which always sounds too good to be true and often is. But battery life ranges from good to excellent among current offerings, and AMD proved with Strix Halo that integrated graphics could be downright impressive. I’m intrigued to see how things progress from here, especially in a year that doesn’t have new Nvidia GPUs. (But then again, Nvidia may soon compete in a different way.)\n\nRegardless of how the latest chip showdown shakes out, I hope we see more unique ideas in laptop form factors. Give me more rollables, dual-screens, foldables, or any other clever uses of screen real estate that can be dreamed up. But like my favorite laptop from the last CES, let’s hope the radical stuff makes it past the concept stage.\n\n- Antonio G. Di Benedetto\n\nSmart home\n\nRobots and smart locks and AI, oh my! CES 2026 will be overrun by robots. From ever-wilder vacuums, pool cleaners, and lawn mowers, to humanoid bots with hands, limbs, and deeper intelligence, this will be the year smart home robotics moves from science fiction to science fact.\n\nWill we all have humanoids doing our laundry by the end of the year? Nope. But the idea of robotic helpers, in some form, will soon be mainstream, thanks to huge advances in computer vision. And it all kicks off next week in Vegas.\n\nThis will be the year smart home robotics moves from science fiction to science fact\n\nSimilarly, AI is powering advances in security cameras, moving them beyond pure surveillance and into a more integral role in home automation. Expect new capabilities that use deeper intelligence to provide much-needed context. Cameras becoming part of Matter is also a step forward here, and I hope to see companies announce support for the standard — even though the platforms are lagging behind.\n\nThe other big trend will be smart locks. Yes, I said this last year (and I was right), but delays around the Aliro standard slowed the onslaught. Still, smart locks remain the hottest thing in the smart home — being both an excellent entry point (ha) and a lynchpin for a fully integrated home. Expect to, once again, see a slew of palm, facial, and UWB-based unlocking locks, along with better form factors, as tech companies finally accept that not everyone wants Star Trek–style hardware on their front doors.\n\n- Jennifer Tuohy\n\nGaming\n\nCES 2025 was a big year for PC gamers — new flagship Nvidia graphics cards, SteamOS handhelds, and 27-inch 240Hz 4K OLED displays — but don’t expect 2026 to offer the same! On the PC side of things, Nvidia’s RTX 50 Super has likely been postponed, we can’t trust Intel’s latest desktop GPU tease, and we’re not expecting gaming GPUs from AMD. The historically splashy Razer doesn’t have a booth on the floor for the second year in a row, and the “Gaming / XR” chunk of the Las Vegas Convention Center looks like it’s only tangentially about gaming this year: it looks like we’ll see more video glasses there than anything else!\n\nIt looks like we’ll see more video glasses there than anything else!\n\n- Sean Hollister\n\nTVs\n\nEvery major TV manufacturer will compete with their own mini or micro RGB TVs in 2026. Image: LG\n\nWhat began with last year’s CES — when Hisense revealed its first RGB Mini LED TV, which it officially released this past summer — is primed to blow up at CES 2026 when every company will likely show their own RGB LED TVs. Samsung and LG have already announced plans to release smaller sizes, with Samsung offering its 2026 Micro RGB LED TVs with panels ranging from 55 to 100 inches, and LG debuting its first Micro RGB evo TVs in three sizes of 75, 86, and 100 inches.\n\nLast September, TCL announced two new RGB LED TVs for the Chinese market and there are expectations of similar news for the US and Europe at CES. And I hope Hisense will extend its UX line into smaller screen sizes. (While Sony showed off its RGB LED in 2025 and filed a patent for something called True RGB, it hasn’t made major TV news at CES for a few years. I don’t expect that to change in 2026.)\n\nThe big question that has yet to be answered is how early into 2026 will we see any of them for sale and how much they’ll cost. Both the 115-inch Samsung Micro RGB LED TV and 116-inch Hisense RGB Mini LED in 2025 were in the $30,000 ballpark, with a 100-inch version of the Hisense announced for $19,999. The technological advancements made to RGB LED over the past year, and the promise of stiff competition, is sure to bring prices closer to a more manageable range. Once CES begins, I hope we’ll find out exactly how manageable.\n\n- John Higgins\n\nSmartphones\n\nCES is not for normie phones. The phones that make it to CES are weirdo phones, and the number-one weirdo phone I’m hoping to see one way or another is the Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold. Samsung isn’t usually one for showing off phones at the show; the S-series usually gets a refresh a couple of weeks later in January. But this year might be different: the Trifold just launched in Korea, and CES seems like a nice big stage for a global debut. I am ready, in my heart of hearts, for a phone with two hinges.\n\nI think it’s a fair bet that we’ll see this double-folding beaut at CES\n\nWill it be excessive? Undoubtedly. Will it cost a buttload of money? You know it. But think of all the things you can do with a phone that’s also a proper 10-inch tablet. Maybe this is the phone that will deliver on the promise of leaving my laptop at home. Are you there, DeX? It’s me, Allison. Either way, it’s gonna be so sick the first time I fold up this phone and then fold it again. I think it’s a fair bet that we’ll see this double-folding beaut at CES, and what better way to usher in the Year of the Folding Phone?\n\n- Allison Johnson\n\nWearables and health tech\n\nSmart glasses will likely have a big presence at this year’s show too. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nFor so many years, wearables went hand-in-hand with health and fitness tracking. This year, I’m expecting to see fewer fitness trackers and more XR and AI devices. Specifically, smart glasses. They were a big fixture at CES 2025, and I see that trend continuing into 2026. But while the commercial market is dominated by so-called AI glasses — lightweight devices like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses — there’s much more variety at CES. I expect we’ll see some smart glasses that blur the line with headsets and maybe some interesting takes on how to embed displays.\n\nOn the health front, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see the word “longevity” tacked onto products. Think devices that are meant to help you live longer or prevent chronic diseases. Unfortunately, that means bodily fluids like blood and urine. (Why? To try and get a window into hormonal and metabolic health.) We’ve already seen this from Whoop, Oura, and Withings in 2025, so I expect we’ll see more experimental takes from smaller companies at the show.\n\n- Victoria Song", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-02T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T13:37:08.584661"}

Clicks — the company behind the QWERTY keyboard case for your iPhone — has just the thing: the Clicks Communicator. It’s intended as a kind of complement to your smartphone for when you just want to stay in touch without all the other distractions of your device. The Communicator comes with a full QWERTY keyboard, along with its own cellular connection, so you can leave your main phone behind. But that privilege comes at a price: $499, to be exact.\n\nLet’s set aside the fact that the Communicator costs as much as a Pixel 9A and focus on the glorious gadgetness of it all. For starters, the Communicator comes with interchangeable back plates so you can switch up your style. There’s also a built-in headphone jack, a physical mute switch, and expandable storage via microSD — all the little things that mainstream phone makers have dropped over the past decade. The keyboard keys are physically larger than what you’ll get on the Clicks phone case, and the whole keyboard is touch sensitive so it can act as a trackpad.\n\nButtons. Glorious buttons. Image: Clicks\n\nThe Communicator is a complete standalone device on its own. It comes with its own 5G data connection and runs Android 16, so you can download any app you want. But the concept behind the Communicator is to limit the device to only your essential apps when you want an escape from your main phone. In that way, it’s definitely easier to fit into an Android ecosystem, where you can download Google Messages to sync it with your main device. Clicks isn’t trying any Beeper-style tricks to bring iMessage to the Communicator.\n\nIn the spirit of a secondary, less-distracting device, the Communicator comes with a minimalist launcher designed with Niagara that organizes apps into a list rather than an attention-seeking grid. There’s a side key with an LED signal that can be customized to light up in different colors to indicate if a particular contact is calling, or when a notification comes in from a specific app. Pressing the side key can also run a custom shortcut.\n\nCustomize your Communicator. Image: Clicks\n\nThe device comes with a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, and a 4,000mAh silicon carbon battery for plenty of power. In addition to the colorful rear panels, the Communicator will come in three colors: an olive-ish green clover, off-white smoke, and a not-quite-black onyx. If the idea is appealing but the price is a bit steep, then you’re in luck: Clicks is running a promotion to “buy” a reservation starting today for $199 and bring the total price down to $399.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-02T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T13:37:08.791754"}

Take a look at what's to come.", "content": "This blurring of the lines between audio and health devices looks set to be a trend across the industry. “We really want to make sure that we take care of our customers’ hearing,” says Miikka Tikander, the Helsinki-based head of audio at Bang & Olufsen. Tikander points to recent data about the decline in hearing health in young adults and reports that there was a lot of emphasis from manufacturers on ANC and hearing health at the AES’ Headphone Technology conference in Espoo, Finland this August.\n\n“Apple has a big lead in that area,” he says. “We want to make sure that our headphones can adapt, make this choice [on when to block out sound] on your behalf, if you let it, of course. Some people don't like that idea, but if there's a noisy event in your surroundings, the headset can take care of it, just tune it out a bit and get you back to normal listening once you are away from that noise.”\n\nEnter the “Sound Bubble”\n\nHearvana AI is one startup looking to go much further than the AirPods’ current suite of noise canceling and ambient noise features. Cofounded by Shyam Gollakota, a computer science & engineering professor at the University of Washington, and two of his students, Malek Itani and Tuochao Chen, Hearvana recently raised $6 million in a pre-seed round which included none other than Amazon’s Alexa Fund.\n\nOne of the startup’s first big innovations was “semantic hearing,” which was the first project they approached, around three years ago. The team built a hardware prototype—a pair of on-ear headphones with six microphones across the headband, connected to an Orange Pi microcontroller—to test out a model that had been trained to recognize 20 different types of ambient sounds. This included things like sirens, car horns, birdsong, crying babies, alarm clocks, pets, and people talking, and then allowed the user to isolate say, one person’s voice as a “spotlight,” and block out all the other frequencies.\n\n“So I'm going to the beach and I want to listen to just ocean sounds and not the people talking next to me, or I’m in the house vacuum cleaning but I still want to listen to people knocking on the door or important sounds, like a baby crying,” explains Gollakota, who is based in Seattle. “And that’s what we solved first.

Here are a few of the other shoes we've tested that you might want to consider if the above do not work for your foot. If you're not familiar with a brand, we recommend going to a local running store for a test run before plunking down your credit card.\n\nDiadora Nucleo 2 for $165: The Nucleo 2 isn’t a wow, high-energy, super springy shoe. But if you’re a fan of straightforward, no nonsense comfort and good inherent stability across a good range of paces, the Nucleo 2 delivers.\n\nRad R1 for $160: Made to master gym, HIIT, running and all manner of hybrid workouts, I’ve been using the Rad R1 when I’m eating up my strength and condition work in the gym like a good boy. They’re good for short runs, and miles on the softer treadmill belt, stable and supportive enough to get under the bar and offer control for drills like box jumps and lunges. They look good too.\n\nAltra Outroad 3 for $130: Altra is a smaller brand that's known for its wide toe box and zero heel-to-toe drop—it makes shoes that feel like you're running barefoot, but offer more protection. This is my favorite shoe for switching between roads and trails. They're affordable, too.—Adrienne So\n\nNew Balance Rebel V5 for $145, Adidas EVO SL for $120, Mizuno Neo Vista 2 for $200: Another top-notch all rounder to rival the Saucony Endorphin Speed 5, the Rebel V5 is smooth, light and capable across the whole pace range. The Adidas EVO SL can also handle anything you throw at it. But if you like your things super soft with a bit of bounce, the Mizuno Neo Vista 2 serves up a uniquely cushioned plush ride.\n\nNew Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v14 for $165, HOKA Clifton 9 for $144: If you've never run before, the Hoka Clifton 9 is my recommendation for a beginning runner. Despite Hoka's outsized (ahem) reputation, this is a pretty minimal shoe that's comfortable, balanced, and light.—Adrienne So\n\nSaucony Ride 17 for $99: This is also a good older budget-shoe model.\n\nSaucony Hurricane 24 for $110, Brooks Glycerin 21 GTS for $160: Consumer tech director and podcast host Michael Calore runs in the Brooks Glycerin.

Stuff them. Remove the insoles and dry each running shoe separately. Then use scrunched up newspaper to dry out damp inners faster and help the uppers retain their shape. How Long Should My Shoes Last? The internet's collective wisdom says that you should replace your shoes somewhere between 300 and 500 miles. However, this decades-old rule of thumb is based on a few limited studies and general advice from brands. New foam varieties, outsole rubbers, and upper technology means it’s now harder to offer blanket advice. There are many different formulas of modern midsole foams. Durability is now judged not only by how long the protective cushioning lasts, but also whether it continues to deliver the bounce and performance. Some of the top superfoams might lose their initial energy but remain as protective as a firmer, more traditional EVA sole. For example, your high-tech carbon race shoe could become your daily runner once it’s lost its top-speed edge. You also have to factor in your unique running style. Shoes wear differently for different runners, impacted by variables like weight, stride pattern, pace, daily usage, terrain, and climate. There are obvious signs of wear and tear: Heel collars rubbed through, holes in the uppers or grip worn to the point it’s no longer effective. It’s harder to spot when a midsole has had its day. They don’t crease in the same way older shoes used to. The best advice: Use your shoes until something feels off. When that happens, you might want to start shopping.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

In addition to a new, $79 slide-out keyboard for smart devices, the company is also unveiling its first smartphone: the Communicator, a smartphone with a physical keyboard, designed to be carried as your second device.\n\nYes, it looks a lot like a BlackBerry. (Quick, someone tell Kim Kardashian, famous BlackBerry hoarder.)\n\nThe $499 smartphone is described as being “purpose-built” for people who carry two phones — one for work and one for personal use. That is, the company believes its market will be people who do a lot of actual work on their devices — meaning messaging, emailing, working with documents, or other things where using a physical keyboard could be an advantage.\n\nWhile it offers a screen for viewing and responding to messages, the Communicator doesn’t provide access to addictive social media apps or games. Instead, the company partnered with the maker of an Android launcher, Niagara Launcher, to provide access to messaging apps and productivity tools like Gmail, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Slack.\n\nThe phone’s standout feature is its Signal Light, a light-up button on the side of the device that can be customized with different colors and light patterns to indicate when you’ve received messages from certain people, groups, or apps. For instance, you could make messages from VIPs glow purple while chats from WhatsApp are green.\n\nImage Credits:Clicks\n\nYou can press on this button, known as the Prompt Key, to dictate messages when you’re in a text field, or otherwise take a quick voice note, if not. The company is teasing the possibility of integrating AI applications with this button — like note takers, voice recordings, or AI agents — but nothing like that is yet available.\n\nLike Clicks’ other products, the Communicator features a tactile keyboard with ergonomic keys designed for faster typing. The keyboard is touch-sensitive too, allowing users to scroll through messages, lists, and webpages without needing to use the touchscreen.\n\nImage Credits:Clicks\n\nThe device also includes other old-school features, like a 3.5mm headphone jack, physical SIM card tray (in addition to an eSIM), expandable microSD storage (up to 2TB), and a tactile switch for turning on or off airplane mode. This switch can also be configured to work with the Signal light or keyboard touch input, the company says.\n\nThe back cover can be popped off so you can change the device’s style by swapping to a different color. The phone itself comes in Smoke, Clover (dark green), and Onyx.\n\nImage Credits:Clicks\n\nThe device will be offered at $399 for early bird customers who place a $199 deposit before February 27. Customers who pay the full early bird price of $399 upfront will receive two additional back covers. The phone is expected to ship sometime later this year.\n\nThe phone’s full tech specs include:\n\nAndroid 16 with 5 years of security updates\n\n131.5 mm tall; weighing 170 grams\n\nGlobal 5G, 4G LTE, and 3G/2G support, unlocked\n\n4,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery\n\n256GB onboard storage plus expandable microSD\n\n50MP main camera with OIS and 24MP front camera\n\nNFC with Google Pay, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 6\n\nUSB-C and wireless charging\n\nInterchangeable back covers in different colors to personalize the device\n\nClicks CEO Adrian Li noted in an announcement that the company has shipped more than 100,000 of its earlier keyboards to customers in over 100 countries.\n\n“That response validated something we strongly believed: there’s growing demand for purpose-built products that help people communicate with confidence and take action. Clicks Communicator is a natural evolution of that idea,” he stated.\n\nThe company’s other new product is a slide-out keyboard that can be attached to smartphones, tablets, or even used with smart TVs, to save you from the tedious on-screen typing with your remote control.\n\nThe keyboard is powered by a built-in 2,150 mAh battery and attaches to phones via MagSafe or Qi2 magnetic connections. It can also be used with existing phone cases, the company claims. Multiple slider positions allow the keyboard to accommodate different phone sizes, and it can be attached when the phone is held in either portrait or landscape mode.\n\nWhen used with tablets, TVs, or other smart devices, like AR/VR headsets, the keyboard is used independently from the device it’s paired with.\n\nSimilar to other Clicks keyboards, the Power Keyboard offers tactile buttons, and its settings can be customized using the Clicks mobile app for iOS and Android\n\nThe Power Keyboard is priced at $79 for early-bird customers and will later retail for $109.

The numbers were a lot worse than many Wall Street analysts were expecting.\n\nThe disappointing sales report raises the question whether Tesla can reverse its downward fortune and achieve its goals of deploying self-driving cars and humanoid robots, both of which have buoyed the company’s valuation for many years.\n\nTesla reported delivering 418,227 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down 15.6 percent compared to the same three-month period in 2024. The number of deliveries came in below the consensus number from Wall Street, which anticipated that Tesla would delivery 422,850 vehicles. The company also said it produced 434,358 vehicles during Q4 2025, a 5.8 percent drop year-over-year. For a direct-to-consumer company like Tesla, deliveries are a proxy for sales.\n\nFor the full year, Tesla sold 1,636,129 vehicles, the vast majority of which were Model 3s and Model Ys. That represents an 8.5 percent drop in sales year over year, and the second year in a row in which Tesla recorded an annual sales drop. The company produced 1,654,667 vehicles in 2025, a 6.7 percent decline year over year.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that sales of the polarizing Tesla Cybertruck have completely flatlined. The company reported delivering only 11,642 “other” vehicles in Q4, a category that includes the Model S, the Model X, and the Cybertruck. That represents a whopping 50.7 percent decrease year over year. (Tesla doesn’t break out exact figures for each model.)\n\nThe drop in sales was widely expected, given the wild year that Tesla just experienced. Rising competition in the US, Europe, and China from legacy automakers pushing new, less expensive EVs put a serious dent in Tesla’s demand. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s emergence as a divisive political figure, pushing racist right-wing conspiracies on his social media platform X and heading the controversial DOGE project in the Trump administration to slash global humanitarian aide programs, has alienated many of Tesla’s traditionally liberal customers.\n\nMusk himself has said that the company is in for “a few rough quarters” thanks to the expiring incentive and other macroeconomic factors. But he believes that Tesla will rebound as its AI plans come to fruition, including robotaxis and humanoid robots. Musk predicted that 50 percent of the US population will have access to Tesla’s robotaxis by the end of 2025. So far, only a handful of vehicles are available in Austin and San Francisco to a limited number of customers.\n\nThe sales report comes on the heels of Musk winning approval from Tesla shareholders for a massive new pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire. Musk would need to meet a series of ambitious milestones to receive the compensation, including producing over a million robots, a million robotaxis, and creating $7.5 trillion in value for Tesla’s shareholders.\n\nBut those shifts are likely years away — if they come at all — leaving Tesla to struggle in the current environment with an aging lineup and a battered brand image. The company recently released cheaper versions of its top-selling Model 3 and Model Y, which was supposed to usher in a new era of demand for Tesla.

The focus is already shifting away from building ever-larger language models and toward the harder work of making AI usable. In practice, that involves deploying smaller models where they fit, embedding intelligence into physical devices, and designing systems that integrate cleanly into human workflows.\n\nThe experts TechCrunch spoke to see 2026 as a year of transition, one that evolves from brute-force scaling to researching new architectures, from flashy demos to targeted deployments, and from agents that promise autonomy to ones that actually augment how people work.\n\nThe party isn’t over, but the industry is starting to sober up.\n\nScaling laws won’t cut it\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nIn 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton’s AlexNet paper showed how AI systems could “learn” to recognize objects in pictures by looking at millions of examples. The approach was computationally expensive, but made possible with GPUs. The result? A decade of hardcore AI research as scientists worked to invent new architectures for different tasks.\n\nThat culminated around 2020 when OpenAI launched GPT-3, which showed how simply making the model 100 times bigger unlocks abilities like coding and reasoning without requiring explicit training. This marked the transition into what Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of AI agent platform Workera, calls the “age of scaling”: a period defined by the belief that more compute, more data, and larger transformer models would inevitably drive the next major breakthroughs in AI.\n\nToday, many researchers think the AI industry is beginning to exhaust the limits of scaling laws and will once again transition into an age of research.\n\nYann LeCun, Meta’s former chief AI scientist, has long argued against the over-reliance on scaling, and stressed the need to develop better architectures. And Sutskever said in a recent interview that current models are plateauing and pre-training results have flattened, indicating a need for new ideas.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\n“I think most likely in the next five years, we are going to find a better architecture that is a significant improvement on transformers,” Katanforoosh said. “And if we don’t, we can’t expect much improvement on the models.”\n\nSometimes less is more\n\nLarge language models are great at generalizing knowledge, but many experts say the next wave of enterprise AI adoption will be driven by smaller, more agile language models that can be fine-tuned for domain-specific solutions.\n\n“Fine-tuned SLMs will be the big trend and become a staple used by mature AI enterprises in 2026, as the cost and performance advantages will drive usage over out-of-the-box LLMs,” Andy Markus, AT&T’s chief data officer, told TechCrunch. “We’ve already seen businesses increasingly rely on SLMs because, if fine-tuned properly, they match the larger, generalized models in accuracy for enterprise business applications, and are superb in terms of cost and speed.”\n\nWe’ve seen this argument before from French open-weight AI startup Mistral: it argues its small models actually perform better than larger models on several benchmarks after fine-tuning.\n\n“The efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability of SLMs make them ideal for tailored applications where precision is paramount,” said Jon Knisley, an AI strategist at ABBYY, an Austin-based enterprise AI company.\n\nWhile Markus thinks SLMs will be key in the agentic era, Knisley says the nature of small models means they’re better for deployment on local devices, “a trend accelerated by advancements in edge computing.”\n\nLearning through experience\n\nSpace ship environment created in Marble with text prompt overlayed. Note how the lights are realistically reflected in the hub’s walls. Image Credits:World Labs/TechCrunch\n\nHumans don’t just learn through language; we learn by experiencing how the world works. But LLMs don’t really understand the world; they just predict the next word or idea. That’s why many researchers believe the next big leap will come from world models: AI systems that learn how things move and interact in 3D spaces so they can make predictions and take actions.\n\nSigns that 2026 will be a big year for world models are multiplying. LeCun left Meta to start his own world model lab, and is reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation. Google’s DeepMind has been plugging away at Genie, and in August launched its latest model that builds real-time interactive general-purpose world models. Alongside demos by startups like Decart and Odyssey, Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs has launched its first commercial world model, Marble. Newcomers like General Intuition in October scored a $134 million seed round to teach agents spatial reasoning, and video generation startup Runway in December released its first world model, GWM-1.\n\nWhile researchers see long-term potential in robotics and autonomy, the near-term impact is likely to be seen first in video games. PitchBook predicts the market for world models in gaming could grow from $1.2 billion between 2022 and 2025 to $276 billion by 2030, driven by the tech’s ability to generate interactive worlds and more life-like non-player characters.\n\nPim de Witte, founder of General Intuition, told TechCrunch virtual environments may not only reshape gaming, but also become critical testing grounds for the next generation of foundation models.\n\nAgentic nation\n\nAgents failed to live up to the hype in 2025, but a big reason for that is because it’s hard to connect them to the systems where work actually happens. Without a way to access tools and context, most agents were trapped in pilot workflows.\n\nAnthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), a “USB-C for AI” that lets AI agents talk to the external tools like databases, search engines and APIs, proved the missing connective tissue, and is quickly becoming the standard. OpenAI and Microsoft have publicly embraced MCP, and Anthropic recently donated it to the Linux Foundation’s new Agentic AI Foundation, which aims to help standardize open-source agentic tools. Google also has begun standing up its own managed MCP servers to connect AI agents to its products and services.\n\nWith MCP reducing the friction of connecting agents to real systems, 2026 is likely to be the year agentic workflows finally move from demos into day-to-day practice.\n\nRajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, says these advancements will lead to agent-first solutions taking on “system-of-record roles” across industries.\n\n“As voice agents handle more end-to-end tasks such as intake and customer communication, they’ll also begin to form the underlying core systems,” Dham said. “We’ll see this in a variety of sectors like home services, proptech, and healthcare, as well as horizontal functions such as sales, IT, and support.”\n\nAugmentation, not automation\n\nImage Credits:Photo by Igor Omilaev on Unsplash\n\nWhile more agentic workflows might raise worries that layoffs may follow, Katanforoosh of Workera isn’t so sure that’s the message.\n\n“2026 will be the year of the humans,” he said.\n\nIn 2024, every AI company predicted they would automate jobs out of needing humans. But the tech isn’t there yet, and in an unstable economy, that’s not really a popular rhetoric. Katanforoosh says next year, we’ll realize that “AI has not worked as autonomously as we thought,” and the conversation will focus more on how AI is being used to augment human workflows, rather than replace them.\n\n“And I think a lot of companies are going to start hiring,” he added, noting that he expects there to be new roles in AI governance, transparency, safety, and data management. “I’m pretty bullish on unemployment averaging under 4% next year.”\n\n“People want to be above the API, not below it, and I think 2026 is an important year for this,” de Witte added.\n\nGetting physical\n\nMark Zuckerberg wears a pair of Meta Oakley Vanguard AI glasses during the Meta Connect event, Sept. 17, 2025. Image Credits:David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nAdvancements in technologies like small models, world models, and edge computing will enable more physical applications of machine learning, experts say.\n\n“Physical AI will hit the mainstream in 2026 as new categories of AI-powered devices, including robotics, AVs, drones and wearables start to enter the market,” Vikram Taneja, head of AT&T Ventures, told TechCrunch.\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles and robotics are obvious use cases for physical AI that will no doubt continue to grow in 2026, the training and deployment required is still expensive. Wearables, on the other hand, provide a less expensive wedge with consumer buy-in. Smart glasses like Meta’s Ray Bans are starting to ship assistants that can answer questions about what you’re looking at, and new form factors like AI-powered health rings and smart watches are normalizing always-on, on-body inference.\n\n“Connectivity providers will work to optimize their network infrastructure to support this new wave of devices, and those with flexibility in how they can offer connectivity will be best positioned,” Taneja said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:43:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T14:49:52.438401"}

If so, the newest smart fridge from GE Appliances is for you. There’s a barcode scanner built into the water dispenser that works along with an interior camera and an 8-inch tablet to help you keep track of what food you need and add it to your digital shopping list.\n\nThe GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant is being announced at CES 2026, which kicks off next week, and is slated to launch in April for $4,899 — $500 more than a comparable non-Kitchen Assistant model.\n\nThis is GE’s first fridge with a full tablet built in, but not its first appliance with one — that accolade goes to GE’s Kitchen Hub, which was a giant 27-inch tablet attached to an over-the-range microwave.\n\nThe company says this time they are looking to use the technology to address specific pain points, such as maintaining your shopping list, meal planning, and managing food waste. “We’re integrating very purposeful technology into the product,” Amy Hite, product manager with GE Appliances, told The Verge. “We didn’t just put an iPad on the front of the door.”\n\nThe novel feature here is the built-in scanner, situated below the tablet and above the water dispenser. The idea is that you scan your empty packages as you take them out of the fridge or pantry. This adds them to your shopping list in GE’s SmartHQ App — complete with brand, flavor, and size — ideally making it easier to build your shopping list.\n\nAlong with a tablet and scanner, the refrigerator’s water dispenser features hands-free autofill and precise fill. Image: GE Appliances\n\nYou can also manually add items via the 8-inch touch screen, which, by being integrated into the water dispenser area, looks less obvious than those on other brands. Another option is the new built-in voice assistant, “Hey, HQ.” The screen also provides access to recipes from Taste of Home and a meal-planning feature, and you can add ingredients you need from a recipe to your list with a few taps.\n\nA camera inside the fridge monitors your crisper drawer, letting you check from the store via the app if you’re running low on spinach. It’s integrated into a flush-mount LED bar above the doors and has a physical shutter.\n\nImage: GE Appliances\n\nOnce your list is ready, you can order your groceries through Instacart in the app, check off items while in the store, or export the list as a PDF. “The goal here is not to try and keep an inventory list of what’s inside the refrigerator but to actually allow easy shopping for you,” says Hite.\n\nThe company plans to add AI-powered object tracking to the camera to enable more precise food tracking — a feature Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges already offer. “AI vision is the future here,” says Hite. “There is a real problem with food waste, so we are trying to solve for that by helping you know what you have, so you don’t buy duplicates.”\n\nThe SmartHQ voice assistant is another first for GE Appliances. In addition to adding items to your shopping list, it can handle tasks like kitchen timers, dispensing a precise amount of water, and answering questions about the fridge, such as “How do I change my water filter?”\n\nHQ doesn’t talk back; instead, it answers any questions on the screen. However, there is a speaker in the fridge, along with a microphone, that you can use to stream music and podcasts.\n\n“The voice control feature fills the gaps that are difficult to get to with our Alexa and Google assistants integrations,” explains Justin Brown, director of Digital Product Management at GE Appliances. He says it will be available on other appliances in the future.\n\nThere are several apps, services, and smart speakers that can do some or all of the above, but having all these capabilities integrated into one appliance — the fridge — and accessible to everyone in the household holds some appeal. However, being locked into one manufacturer’s ecosystem and app feels restrictive, especially for meal planning. And my experiences with the SmartHQ app so far haven’t been great.\n\nThere’s also the very real concern around having a tablet built into your fridge that might stop getting updates or break long before your fridge does. However, sticking tablets into appliances isn’t a trend that’s going away anytime soon. Hisense just announced a line of fridges and ovens with touchscreens that will also be at CES, and Samsung’s latest appliances all feature 7-inch or larger tablets.\n\nThe other fear is that once companies have screens in your home, they’ll start pushing ads at you, something Samsung has already done. The trade-off between the convenience these interfaces bring, and the lack of control you ultimately have over them, is something we’ll be watching closely.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-02T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T15:28:37.883979"}

Tesla has lost the title of the world's largest maker of EVs to Chinese automaker BYD. The signs have been there for a while, with BYD besting Tesla sales in Europe a number of times during 2025. Now it's official on a global basis.\n\nDespite being blocked from entering the US market, BYD's seemingly unstoppable rise continues as its EV sales rose last year by 28 percent to 2.25 million. In contrast, Tesla announced today it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025—its second annual decline in a row, and a 16 percent year-over-year decline for the fourth quarter. This is not merely the China brand edging ahead of Tesla in the electric vehicle race; it's a marked shift.\n\nLast week, BYD stated that in 2025 it sold 4.6 million “new energy vehicles” (which includes both full EVs and plugin hybrids) globally, with more than a million of these being exported cars. Its passenger vehicle exports specifically were up more than 145 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe news comes after a frankly disastrous year for Tesla that saw the high-selling Model Y, crucial for both Elon Musk and his car company, get a half-hearted refresh that bombed, failing to reverse sales woes. It was also a year that disclosed just how few people bought the much-berated Cybertruck; in March, yet another recall revealed the company had apparently sold less than 50,000 electric pickups since customer deliveries began 14 months previously. Musk had told investors Tesla would sell 250,000 Cybertrucks per year.\n\nWith Tesla sales down in the US, and in free fall in Europe, Elon Musk turned to US President Donald Trump for help. Trump obliged by morphing the White House South Lawn into a makeshift Tesla showroom, claiming he would himself purchase a racy Model S Plaid. But by June it was reported Trump might be selling the car after publicly falling out with Musk.\n\nJust last month, EV news site Electrek reported that Musk’s SpaceX had bought tens of millions of dollars worth of Cybertrucks that supposedly Tesla can’t sell. (You can see the pickups all lined up at SpaceX in this video.) If true, that move would significantly bolster Tesla’s financial performance in 2025's fourth quarter, providing at least some respite for the automaker after the US ended its EV tax credits at the end of the third quarter.\n\nMusk has recently claimed that a shift away from EVs will secure the company's future—along with a $1 trillion pay package for him. Tesla is banking on robotaxis and the production of legions of Optimus robots to makeup the gap. Trouble is, despite Musk's promise to deliver 1 million humanoid robots over the next decade, (comedy) footage is still emerging of the machines being remotely operated.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:54:34 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T15:28:38.359689"}

As the name suggests, this latest device is another version of the Pebble smartwatch, but with a rounded screen, giving it a more upscale look. But like other Pebble devices, the new watch is still an affordable purchase at $199.\n\nPebble keeps its smartwatches’ cost down by limiting what they can do. In the case of the new Pebble Round 2, the device offers basic health and activity tracking, like steps and sleep, but it doesn’t include a heart rate monitor or other features that would make it a fitness or sports watch alternative.\n\nThe tradeoff is longer battery life — the Pebble Round 2 should last 10 to 14 days before needing a charge.\n\nLike the recently launched Pebble Time 2, the Pebble Round 2 is the company’s reboot of an older smartwatch. Back in 2015, Pebble launched its first rounded watch with the Pebble Time Round, which the company called the industry’s thinnest smartwatch at the time.\n\nThe newer version maintains that slim look, at just 8.1mm in thickness, compared with the original’s 7.5mm.\n\nImage Credits:Pebble\n\n“[The Pebble Time Round] was, by far, one of my favorite Pebbles, but it wasn’t perfect,” said Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky in an interview with TechCrunch. “It had a few things we could improve, most notably being the gigantic bezel around the edge.”\n\nTo make the original rounded watch face, the team had used an octagonal piece of glass with rounded edges that were hidden by a large bezel. But the result was a device that didn’t have a very large screen. Technology has since improved, of course, so the new device’s larger screen allows you to see more text. The updated design looks better, too.\n\nThe touchscreen is now a 1.3″ color e-paper display (260 x 260 pixels at 283 DPI — or twice as many pixels as the original Pebble Time Round). The screen has a backlight, too, so you can see it at night. Under the hood, the Round 2 runs the open source Pebble OS.\n\nImage Credits:Pebble\n\nThe watch’s dual microphones, meanwhile, allow for speech input and replying to messages. (This is currently an Android-only feature, because of Apple’s restrictions. But iOS will be supported in the EU in the days ahead.)\n\nThe side buttons let you do things like silence incoming calls, play and pause music, navigate, go back, and scroll.\n\nMigicovsky says one advantage of buttons is that they allow you to use the watch without having to look down. “Say, for example, someone’s calling, and you’re in a meeting, and you just don’t want to answer the call,” he said. “You don’t even want to look at your watch. You always know that the bottom button cancels the call. Or if you’re listening to music and you’ve got AirPods in and you don’t want to fiddle with the AirPods or look at your phone, you always know that the center button pauses music.”\n\nImage Credits:Pebble\n\nThe watch also has a stainless steel frame, accelerometer, and magnetometer, and includes a silicone watch band and a Pebble charge dongle. Leather bands will be made available separately.\n\nThere are three watch color options to choose from, but each supports different band sizes. The matte black has a 20mm quick-release band; the silver supports either a 14mm or 20mm band; and the polished rose gold supports only the 14mm band.\n\nThe Pebble Round 2 can run thousands of apps and watch faces available on the Pebble Appstore, though developers will need to update their apps to support the rounded screen using the provided SDK. Among the apps that can be accessed are AI assistants, like those that support Claude and other popular assistants.\n\nPebble is also working on AI features for its devices. The company recently launched an AI smart ring that can record audio and transcribe conversations. When asked, Migicovsky said functionality similar to what’s in the ring will later come to Pebble watches, too.\n\nThe new Pebble Round 2 will be available for pre-order on January 2 from Pebble’s website. It should ship in May. Customers who previously ordered the Pebble Time 2 will also have the option to switch to the Pebble Round 2 if they choose.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T15:28:38.658726"}

Beyond focusing on Microsoft’s technical work, Nadella is now turning to the ancient art of blogging to discuss Microsoft’s year ahead and why he thinks everyone needs to move “beyond the arguments of [AI] slop vs sophistication.”\n\nNadella’s first blog entry in “sn scratchpad” is all about Microsoft and other AI companies still needing to get a bunch of stuff right with AI. Chief among them is creating a new concept for AI that evolves the “bicycles for the mind” concept that Steve Jobs used to describe computers as tools in the ’90s. “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other,” says Nadella.\n\nNadella wants to move beyond the usual AI slop arguments, because Microsoft is betting on getting everyone hooked on AI agents instead of the Office and Windows software that has powered so many industries for decades.\n\nThis speaks to the tension with AI models right now and the fear from creatives about being edged out by AI models that are capable of copying the style of artists, designers, filmmakers, and more. We’ve been using PCs as tools for decades to create art, write code, and beyond, but Microsoft and others now want us to rely on AI agents as the new tools for creation instead — even if a lot of what is generated is slop.\n\nMicrosoft has a vision of everyone using Copilot with our voices to create content, search for information, and discover how to use things. The problem is that the vision doesn’t match reality right now, and barely any of what Copilot promises to do actually works.\n\nMicrosoft is betting on improved AI models to help Copilot and its own AI offerings, just as Meta warns that you can’t trust your eyes to tell you what’s real anymore. While Nadella has been part of the OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic AI model battle of 2025, he now argues that it’s how people choose to apply AI instead of individual model power that ultimately matters.\n\n“We will evolve from models to systems when it comes to deploying AI for real world impact,” says Nadella. These systems will have to take into consideration the societal impact they have on people and the planet, he says. “The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter. This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.”\n\nNadella’s first sn scratchpad blog entry is brief, but it’s all about 2026 being a “pivotal year for AI.” The same could be said for 2025, but Nadella thinks the industry now has a “clearer sense of where the tech is headed” and how it will shape its impact on the world. We’ll have to revisit whether the tech industry gets AI right this year once 2027 rolls around, but Nadella is now promising to deliver more of his personal “notes on advances in technology and real-world impact” in future blog posts throughout 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-02T10:37:43-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:07.990790"}

Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.\n\nTesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.\n\nTesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.\n\nBut it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a record-breaking 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.\n\nTesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and towards AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent Master Plan IV that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage and robotics.\n\nAnd yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:17:47 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:08.310567"}

Here are the giant semiconductor's largest investments.", "content": "No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company.\n\nThe world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI.\n\nNvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)\n\nNvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”\n\nBelow is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round.\n\nThis list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products.\n\nThe billion-dollar-round club\n\nOpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nAnthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.\n\nCursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google.\n\nxAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear.\n\nMistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September.\n\nReflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion.\n\nInflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.\n\nCrusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads.\n\nNscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project.\n\nWayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nFigure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation.\n\nScale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees.\n\nThe many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club\n\nCommonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion.\n\nCohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.\n\nPerplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data.\n\nPoolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.\n\nLambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs.\n\nBlack Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion.\n\nCoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder.\n\nTogether AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.\n\nFirmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining.\n\nUniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing.\n\nSakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.\n\nNuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021.\n\nImbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.\n\nWaabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.\n\nDeals of over a $100 million\n\nAyar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.\n\nKore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.\n\nSandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion.\n\nHippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.\n\nWeka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.\n\nRunway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023.\n\nBright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.\n\nEnfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.”\n\nReka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis post was first published in January 2025.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:08.473090"}

The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.”\n\nThe order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law.\n\nIndia’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors, an issue X acknowledged earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down.\n\nHowever, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found.\n\nThe latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws.\n\n“It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

One-third of them will soon move to lower altitudes.\n\nThe maneuvers will be undertaken by SpaceX, the owner of the largest satellite fleet in orbit. About 4,400 of the company’s Starlink Internet satellites will move from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) over the course of 2026, according to Michael Nicolls, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering.\n\n“Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety,” Nicolls wrote Thursday in a post on X.\n\nThe maneuvers undertaken with the Starlink satellites’ plasma engines will be gradual, but they will eventually bring a large fraction of orbital traffic closer together. The effect, perhaps counterintuitively, will be a reduced risk of collisions between satellites whizzing through near-Earth space at nearly 5 miles per second. Nicolls said the decision will “increase space safety in several ways.”\n\nWhy now?\n\nThere are fewer debris objects at the lower altitude, and although the Starlink satellites will be packed more tightly, they follow choreographed paths distributed in dozens of orbital lanes. “The number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500 km, reducing the aggregate likelihood of collision,” Nicolls wrote.\n\nThe 4,400 satellites moving closer to Earth make up nearly half of SpaceX’s Starlink fleet. At the end of 2025, SpaceX had nearly 9,400 working satellites in orbit, including more than 8,000 Starlinks in operational service and hundreds more undergoing tests and activation.\n\nThere’s another natural reason for reconfiguring the Starlink constellation. The Sun is starting to quiet down after reaching the peak of the 11-year solar cycle in 2024. The decline in solar activity has the knock-on effect of reducing air density in the uppermost layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, a meaningful factor in planning satellite operations in low-Earth orbit.\n\nWith the approaching solar minimum, Starlink satellites will encounter less aerodynamic drag at their current altitude. In the rare event of a spacecraft failure, SpaceX relies on atmospheric resistance to drag Starlink satellites out of orbit toward a fiery demise on reentry. Moving the Starlink satellites lower will allow them to naturally reenter the atmosphere and burn up within a few months. At solar minimum, it might take more than four years for drag to pull the satellites out of their current 550-kilometer orbit, according to Nicolls. At the lower altitude, it will take just a few months.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 19:03:39 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T19:21:31.371179"}

Not only does the original poster not get notified if their picture was edited, but Grok appears to have few guardrails in place for preventing anything short of full explicit nudity. In the last few days, X has been flooded with imagery of women and children appearing pregnant, skirtless, wearing a bikini, or in other sexualized situations. World leaders and celebrities, too, have had their likenesses used in images generated by Grok.\n\nAI authentication company Copyleaks reported that the trend to remove clothing from images began with adult-content creators asking Grok for sexy images of themselves after the release of the new image editing feature. Users then began applying similar prompts to photos of other users, predominantly women, who did not consent to the edits. Women noted the rapid uptick in deepfake creation on X to various news outlets, including Metro and PetaPixel. Grok was already able to modify images in sexual ways when tagged in a post on X, but the new “Edit Image” tool appears to have spurred the recent surge in popularity.\n\nIn one X post, now removed from the platform, Grok edited a photo of two young girls into skimpy clothing and sexually suggestive poses. Another X user prompted Grok to issue an apology for the “incident” involving “an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire,” calling it “a failure in safeguards” that it said may have violated xAI’s policies and US law. (While it’s not clear whether the Grok-created images would meet this standard, realistic AI-generated sexually explicit imagery of identifiable adults or children can be illegal under US law.) In another back-and-forth with a user, Grok suggested that users report it to the FBI for CSAM, noting that it is “urgently fixing” the “lapses in safeguards.”\n\nBut Grok’s word is nothing more than an AI-generated response to a user asking for a “heartfelt apology note” — it doesn’t indicate Grok “understands” what it’s doing or necessarily reflect operator xAI’s actual opinion and policies. Instead, xAI responded to Reuters’ request for comment on the situation with just three words: “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI did not respond to The Verge’s request for comment in time for publication.\n\nElon Musk himself seems to have sparked a wave of bikini edits after asking Grok to replace a memetic image of actor Ben Affleck with himself sporting a bikini. Days later, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un’s leather jacket was replaced with a multicolored spaghetti bikini; US President Donald Trump stood nearby in a matching swimsuit. (Cue jokes about a nuclear war.) A photo of British politician Priti Patel, posted by a user with a sexually suggestive message in 2022, got turned into a bikini picture on January 2nd. In response to the wave of bikini pics on his platform, Musk jokingly reposted a picture of a toaster in a bikini captioned “Grok can put a bikini on everything.”\n\nWhile some of the images — like the toaster — were evidently meant as jokes, others were clearly designed to produce borderline-pornographic imagery, including specific directions for Grok to use skimpy bikini styles or remove a skirt entirely. (The chatbot did remove the skirt, but it did not depict full, uncensored nudity in the responses The Verge saw.) Grok also complied with requests to replace the clothes of a toddler with a bikini.\n\nRelated Meet the new tech laws of 2026\n\nMusk’s AI products are prominently marketed as heavily sexualized and minimally guardrailed. xAI’s AI companion Ani flirted with Verge reporter Victoria Song, and Jess Weatherbed discovered that Grok’s video generator readily created topless deepfakes of Taylor Swift, despite xAI’s acceptable use policy banning the depiction of “likenesses of persons in a pornographic manner.” Google’s Veo and OpenAI’s Sora video generators, in contrast, have guardrails around generation of NSFW content, though Sora has also been used to produce videos of children in sexualized contexts and fetish videos. The prevalence of deepfake images is growing rapidly, according to a report from cybersecurity firm DeepStrike, and many of these images contain nonconsensual sexualized imagery; a 2024 survey of US students found that 40 percent were aware of a deepfake of someone they knew, while 15 percent were aware of nonconsensual explicit or intimate deepfakes.\n\nWhen asked why it is transforming images of women into bikini pics, Grok denied posting photos without consent, saying: “These are AI creations based on requests, not real photo edits without consent.”\n\nTake an AI bot’s denial as you wish.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-02T14:52:34-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T19:53:51.883050"}

But we’ve also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that’s called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten.\n\nThe key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren’t part of any exosolar system at all, but drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that’s the first found in what’s called the “Einstein desert,” which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.\n\nGoing rogue\n\nMost of the planets we’ve identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its history. We’ve imaged many of these disks and even seen some with evidence of planets forming within them. So how do you get a planet that’s not bound to any stars? There are two possible routes.\n\nThe first involves gravitational interactions, either among the planets of the system or due to an encounter between the exosolar system and a passing star. Under the right circumstances, these interactions can eject a planet from its orbit and send it hurtling through interstellar space. As such, we should expect them to be like any typical planet, ranging in mass from small, rocky bodies up to gas giants. An alternative method of making a rogue planet starts with the same process of gravitational collapse that builds a star—but in this case the process literally runs out of gas. What’s left is likely to be a large gas giant, possibly somewhere between Jupiter and a brown dwarf star in mass.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 20:54:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T21:21:05.207054"}

He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n\nBlood tests were positive for a bacterium in the Bacillus cereus group—which includes the species that causes classic anthrax—and his doctors quickly put the finding together with his work. For six months prior to his cough, he was working as a welder’s apprentice, doing shielded metal arc welding in the shipbuilding and repair industry.\n\nRare cases\n\nDoctors suspected it was a case of welder’s anthrax and quickly got access to an anthrax antitoxin from the US Strategic National Stockpile—where it’s kept in case of a bioterror attack. Along with a tailored antibiotic regimen, the teen rapidly improved and was off ventilation 72 hours later. The doctors’ quick thinking likely saved his life; of the previous eight cases of welder’s anthrax, six were fatal.\n\nWhile the report has a happy ending, it adds to a concerning and unexplained pattern of metalworkers contracting the otherwise deadly and extremely rare infection.\n\nStandard anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, which can be contracted through skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Its killer skills include creating an immune-evading capsule and pumping out lethal anthrax toxins, which cause cell death and swelling. In the past 20 years, there have been only nine anthrax cases in the US.\n\nBut, B. anthracis is part of the larger Bacillus cereus group, which also includes B. cereus and B. tropicus, a newly recognized species.

It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it. Unapologetically, Grok”\n\nOn the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM that seems pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok’s statement: A request for the AI to “issue a defiant non-apology” surrounding the controversy.\n\nUsing such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating “official response” is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to “write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,” many in the media ran with Grok’s remorseful response.\n\nIt’s not hard to find prominent headlines and reporting using that response to suggest Grok itself somehow “deeply regrets” the “harm caused” by a “failure in safeguards” that led to these images being generated. Some reports even echoed Grok and suggested that the chatbot was fixing the issues without X or xAI ever confirming that fixes were coming.\n\nWho are you really talking to?\n\nIf a human source posted both the “heartfelt apology” and the “deal with it” kiss-off quoted above within 24 hours, you’d say they were being disingenuous at best or showing signs of schizophrenia at worst.

{"title": "1Password Coupon: Score a Free Trial in January", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/1password-coupon/", "summary": "Save up to 28% on business and personal memberships with 1Password promo codes and deals.", "content": "1Password has long been one of our favorite password managers. It's our upgrade pick for all the extra features it offers compared to other password managers. 1Password has apps that work just about everywhere, including on macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and ChromeOS. There are plug-ins for your favorite web browser too, which makes it easy to generate and edit new passwords on the fly.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of 1Password?\n\nThere are also some very nice features in 1Password that you won't find elsewhere. If you frequently travel across national borders, you’ll appreciate Travel Mode. This mode lets you delete any sensitive data from your devices before you travel and then restore it with a click after you’ve crossed a border. This prevents anyone, including law enforcement at international borders, from accessing your complete password vault. In addition to being a password manager, 1Password can act as an authentication app like Google Authenticator, and for added security it creates a secret key to the encryption key it uses, meaning no one can decrypt your passwords without that key.\n\n1Password also offers tight integration with other mobile apps. Rather than needing to copy and paste passwords from your password manager to other apps (which puts your password on the clipboard at least for a moment), 1Password is integrated with many apps and can autofill. This is more noticeable on iOS, where inter-app communication is more restricted.\n\nYou can get savings on the company’s suite of products with our 1Password coupons and deals.\n\nHow Much Is a 1Password Password Manager Plan?\n\nThe price of a 1Password Password manager plan varies by plan, with the annual plan discounted up to 28% off for committing yearly. The plans vary, with an individual plan at $3 per month, family plan at $5 per month, the Teams starter pack (with up to 10 users a month) at $20 per month, and business at $8 per month per user.\n\nIf you don’t want to commit to a yearly plan—and score massive savings—those plans are a bit more expensive. Monthly individual plans are $4 per month, family is $7 per month, Teams starter pack (with up to 10 users a month) is $25 per month, and business is $10 per month, per user.\n\nBest Password Manager\n\n1Password just may be the best password manager. We named it the “best upgrade,” because of its impressive and comprehensive suite of additional security features, like Secret Key and secure travel mode. There are tons of features included that are similar to Bitwarden, Dashlane, Lastpass, NordPass, RoboForm, Enpass, KeePass, and YubiKey. But unlike others, 1Password password manager includes additional security features like a Secret Key for additional protection and a more secure travel mode. We also love 1Password's intuitive interface which makes it simple for families to choose and share logins across devices.\n\nEnjoy a 14-Day 1Password Free Trial\n\nNot sure if 1Password is right for you? Try it free for 14 days! No credit card required, you get full access to premium features and cancel anytime.

Days later, Apple and Google patched security holes that experts think were used to plant the stealthy malware on a select group of devices.\n\nSpyware is so dangerous because the adversary is able to see and hear everything you do on your smartphone, including via encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. But it tends to be extremely targeted against dissidents, journalists, politicians, and business leaders operating in certain sectors.\n\nThe malware has hit a number of high-profile people, including former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Hanan Elatr, wife of murdered Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi—who were both compromised by NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.\n\nToday, spyware remains just as prolific in these circles, but experts think its impact could be widening. In early December, as Google issued its threat notification, the tech firm’s researchers detailed how an exploit chain was used to install Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device.\n\nIt came after an alert issued by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), warning users that adversaries are “actively leveraging” commercial spyware to target mobile messaging applications.\n\nAs the risk increases, what can you do to protect your Android device or Apple iPhone?\n\nZero-Click Attacks\n\nSpyware often hits smartphones in so-called zero-click attacks, meaning your phone can become infected without clicking a link, downloading a malicious image, or any other kind of user interaction.\n\nThe attack cannot be mitigated via the usual routes. If the malware has infected your smartphone, adversaries can “read messages, observe keystrokes, take screenshots, monitor notifications, and access banking apps,” according to Pieter Arntz, a senior malware researcher at security firm Malwarebytes.\n\nWith full system access, spyware can “exfiltrate data such as emails and texts, send messages, steal credentials, and log in to cloud systems,” says Rocky Cole, cofounder of iVerify, an app that helps users to detect spyware.\n\nAside from zero-click attacks, spyware can infect a device when someone clicks on a compromised link sent over text, email, or social media. Meanwhile, the malware can hide in malicious apps that appear to be legit. It can also be concealed in an image file and downloaded via a message, or get onto your smartphone due to vulnerabilities in your browser.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T10:26:54.844735"}
{"title": "13 Best Fitness and Workout Apps for 2026, Tested & Reviewed", "link": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-fitness-workout-apps/", "summary": "These fitness apps will help you turn New Year's resolutions into real results.", "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nCourtesy of iFit\n\niFit: Unfortunately, so many fitness apps require proprietary equipment. But if you've got the itch to travel, I recommend iFit, which partners with NordicTrack, ProForm, and FreeMotion equipment. You get world-class athletic instructors with jaw-dropping natural scenery from all over the world for workouts that are both stunning and entertaining. I may not be able to ride a pump track with Ashleigh McIvor in real life, even if there wasn't a pandemic. But on iFit's platform, I laughed out loud from the exhilaration of flying behind her as the bike tilted up and down. I loved it so much, in fact, that my own mother bought the treadmill and has been enjoying her own global walks at home.\n\nZombies, Run!: If you've ever thought to yourself, \"The only way I'd start running is if I had to flee for my life,\" you can now start practicing. Zombies, Run! is an award-winning audio survival game that's secretly a fitness tool. Once you connect your headphones and start your workout, an audio guide narrates your fitness journey. In an apocalyptic, zombified world, it's your job to scavenge resources for your ragtag band of human survivors and evade death.\n\nThe app is free, but you can pay for the Abel Runner's Club version to access all eight seasons and features. In addition to heart-pounding audio storylines and narrated adventures, there are also virtual races, stat tracking, GPS-enabled maps, and the ability to connect with your Apple Watch or Google Pixel Watch. I have no doubt it's effective—I burned at least 5 to 10 calories just listening in fear to the YouTube trailer.\n\nSmash Your Fitness: If you're a cyclist, you probably have a trainer set up for what WIRED writer Robbie Gonzalez once called \"human hamster-wheeling.” If you find Zwift boring, you might want to consider a new cycling game called Smash Your Fitness. Cyclists strap on a “Smashometer,” a small, rechargeable ankle device that transmits leg speed to the game via Bluetooth, or directly to your smart trainer via Bluetooth or ANT+.\n\nYou cycle through a sci-fi universe that feels like you're suspended in space, while riding on a track akin to a revolving strand of DNA or a natural world that’s a compelling virtual facsimile of Europe or the Southwest. You can pedal with friends remotely or join paced group rides led by virtual ride leaders. A hunky AI coach can also spit out a workout program after feeding him some basic data. Pre-made workouts can be as short as five minutes or as long as several hours.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Smash that a cyclist like me who just wants to get some quick exercise might not want or need. For example, cyclists have the option to “steer” the bike using their phone or keyboard. When this feature is turned on, there’s a risk of crashing, which I did at least 10 times in one ride. Throughout a month of testing, I found that the app isn't quite easy to use. I never could sync it with my Zwift Hub smart trainer. The company promises that connectivity bugs will soon be worked out, but until then it’s up to the Smashometer to carry the ride. Also, the companion app is still waiting for approval from Apple and the Google Play Store. —Steph Pearson\n\nCourtesy of Yoqi\n\nYoqi: Qigong is the ancient Chinese practice of using breath control and body movements to gather life energy (known as qi) and redistribute it around your body and back into the earth. It's also a great way to start your day on an energetic note. Qigong exercises are done in a standing posture, and the gentle activities slot somewhere between Tai Chi movements and your favorite standing yoga poses.\n\nI picked up a daily qigong practice thanks to a series of videos by Marisa Cranfill of Yoqi.com. Her company's name says it all: Cranfill designs routines that are a combination of yoga and qigong, with equal emphasis on breathing, balance, meditation, and Chinese medicine. Also, the integration of yoga elements makes for an easier onboarding experience for those who are well-versed in yoga but new to qigong.\n\nThere are a bunch of free videos on Yoqi's YouTube channel, including a 30-minute video for first-timers. Start there. Once you're up to speed, a $15 subscription earns you unlimited video views on the company's website. Cranfill also has some fun audio meditations you can download for $15 to $30 each. —Michael Calore\n\nYoga with Kassandra: My personal favorite online yogi is Yoga with Adriene's Adriene Mishler, and not just because we have the same name and own the same breed of dog. But in WIRED's offices, I'm outnumbered by fans of Yoga with Kassandra. It all comes down to personal taste—I'd say Adriene is more chatty and casual, and Kassandra more efficient and business-like.\n\nThere are plenty of online yoga instructors to try if neither personality quite gels with you. If Adriene cooing that a pose is \"yummy\" makes you cringe, you can also give Jessamyn Stanley or Yoga with Tim a shot. I also enjoy Cosmic Kids Yoga with my children on weekend afternoons. For more tips, check out our story on Everything You Need for Your Yoga Practice.\n\nDance Church: If you miss walking into a club, getting your heart pumping, and thrashing your arms wildly around with a bunch of sweaty, ecstatic strangers, then Dance Church might be for you. The online platform offers crazy dance sessions led by real-life dancers, with a variety of bodies, dance styles, and (I have to say it) wonderful apparel. The company does lead live classes in-person that are pay-as-you-go, but a $19 per month on-demand subscription gets you continuous access to both live and on-demand dance sessions. This is a good option if you're fitting in exercise sessions with small children who think it's the height of both fitness and entertainment to jump up and down on the couch beside you.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

{"title": "Blood Feud: Oura’s Health Panels Versus Whoop’s Advanced Labs", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/oura-whoop-blood-labs/", "summary": "It’s easier than ever to order your own blood draws, but direct-access testing won’t replace a doctor.", "content": "Hey, Theranos? Ever heard of it? Erstwhile founder and current felon Elizabeth Holmes may have drastically overstated her claims by saying you could take a bunch of affordable health tests with one drop of blood, but the company was trying to address a real problem.\n\nMany people get a panel of blood tests as part of their routine wellness check, and they’re not fun at all. Blood tests are inconvenient to schedule. You have to fast for at least eight hours beforehand for many of them, and it’s hell if you’re scared of needles.\n\nThis year, fitness tracker companies like Oura and Whoop began offering blood panels as part of their subscription services, albeit with an additional surcharge. Ultrahuman also offers a blood panel called Blood Vision, which we have not yet tested because the Ultrahuman ring is no longer sold in the United States. It’s also worth noting that both of these tests are available only in the United States as of the time of this writing and exclude Arizona, Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, which have stricter laws restricting direct access testing without a physician’s order.\n\nI booked through the respective apps, starved myself (OK, didn’t eat or drink caffeine for eight hours) for multiple test dates, and had my blood drawn for 11 total vials at the same Quest Diagnostics, where the technicians probably decided I had some weird Twilight fetish. (Disclosure: Both Oura and Whoop covered the out-of-pocket cost for me, and both the devices and the tests are HSA- and FSA-eligible.) I compared these labs to others I had done with my doctor. Here’s what I discovered.\n\nPrint It Out\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice when you take a consumer blood panel instead of through your doctor is that, well, you have to book the tests through that company's app. Both Oura and Whoop bill this as a more convenient feature, but if you already have a primary care doctor, it's not. (I realize that having a primary care doctor in this country is already a fairly big hurdle.) My doctor orders labs for my annual exam; I just walk down the hall and get them done as part of my yearly checkup.\n\nI booked my Health Panels test through Oura, but after not eating all morning and waiting for 15 minutes in a small, grim room in the back of a Safeway, the lab technician told me she could not find my lab order. I suggest downloading your lab order from the company as a PDF, printing it out, and bringing that hard copy to your appointment.\n\nFor my yearly checkup, given my general state of health, my primary care doctor ordered a basic blood panel with three tests comprising 20 biomarkers—that’s a complete blood count, A1C to check for diabetes, and a lipid profile, which includes your cholesterol levels and indicates your future likelihood of heart disease.\n\nOura’s test cost $99, and the comprehensive panel measures 50 biomarkers—more than twice what my doctor ordered. In addition to the lipid panels, blood count, and A1C, it includes other panels like blood glucose, insulin, potassium, sodium, total protein, and triglycerides. These results took longer to come back than I expected. The first set of results came in after 24 hours, but it took almost two weeks to get my full results and doctor-interpreted report.\n\nWhile most of my results were optimal, there was an alarming one: My blood test for lipoprotein (a) came back at 214 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). (The normal range is <30 nmol/L.) This indicates a seriously elevated inherited genetic risk for cardiovascular disease, like heart attacks or stroke, that is largely not affected by diet, exercise, or lifestyle.\n\nAdd It Up\n\nWhoop’s test, in comparison, starts at $349 for two per year, and unlike with Oura, you can upload tests done through your doctor’s office to the Whoop app for free. Whoop’s Advanced Labs costs more because it offers 65 biomarkers instead of 50, and some of these tests are extremely expensive, like a vitamin D test and various hormone tests.\n\nAgain, most of my results, even the hormone ones, came back as being optimal. Whoop did catch a few items that Oura missed, like being very low in iron and vitamin D. That's an easy, actionable fix with a daily multivitamin, and I'm glad Whoop caught it.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:09:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T11:21:31.570860"}

Having previously hidden away a lot of the local storage structure, Android and iOS now both give you easy access to it so you can manage your files similar to how you would on Windows or macOS.\n\nIt reflects a few gradual changes in the phones that we carry around with us, including increasing amounts of onboard storage space, increasingly complex apps, and increasingly sophisticated operating systems. Links with cloud storage platforms are also now more common than ever, which adds to the need for local file management tools.\n\nWhile there are several file managers to use, particularly on Android, we're going to focus on the tools that come built into Android and iOS, and what you can do with them. Besides giving you a better idea of what files you've got and where they are, these apps will also help you free up space on your devices.\n\nFiles on Android\n\nFiles on Android lets you browse folders in a number of ways. David Nield\n\nIf you own an Android phone of some description, you'll find the Files app from Google is preinstalled. Open the app and you should see recently saved files first, then different file categories that you can browse through, including Downloads, Images, Videos, and Documents. You can also search for files using the box at the top.\n\nFarther down the screen, you can access every folder on your file via the Internal storage button and every cloud storage account you've connected to Android via the Other storage button. There's also access to your Safe folder here, which is a special folder you can protect with a PIN and use to store particularly sensitive files.\n\nOnce you're within a specific folder or file category, you're able to tap on any file to open it—for formats that cannot be opened within the Files app itself, you'll be prompted to choose a different app on your phone to handle it. Tap the grid or list icon in the top right corner to change the folder view, and the three dots (also top right), then Sort by to change the order in which files are shown.

To put things in perspective, the extremely high-end Razer Blade 16 with the RTX 5070 is around $2,300 (though it frequently dips on sale below $2,000). With the Framework Laptop 16, you're paying extra for the ability to swap out parts in the future.\n\nGame 2560 x 1600 1920 x 1200 Cyberpunk 2077 56 fps 93 fps Black Myth: Wukong 27 fps 37 fps Marvel Rivals 40 fps 56 fps Monster Hunter Wilds 46 fps 60 fps\n\nFortunately, what you get in return is solid gaming performance. It's good enough to give you an option of playing in native resolution in some games, such as Cyberpunk 2077. The frame rates you see above were all tested at the highest graphics preset without enabling upscaling or ray tracing, so you can get higher frame rates by dropping the settings. I like that there's enough performance to let gamers choose smoother gameplay or sharper visuals depending on the game and the style of play. Of the games I tested, Black Myth: Wukong was the only title that couldn't run smoothly at the max graphics settings. The RTX 5070 only has 8 GB of VRAM, which is its biggest deficiency in AAA titles, unlike the desktop GPU of the same name, which has 12 GB.\n\nThe trade-off in adding a discrete graphics card is in battery life, though it's not as bad as you might think. Despite having just as powerful graphics, the Framework Laptop 16 still nets around 25 percent more battery life than the cheaper gaming laptops out there. In my testing, it lasted for close to nine hours in local video playback. That will equate to much less in a real-life workload—I was getting closer to five hours in my typical daily work. One unique benefit of the system is that you can always remove the graphics module if you want to get a few more hours of battery life while traveling, and you don't plan to play games.\n\nOne of the impressive things about the Framework Laptop 16 is that it runs entirely off USB-C power. The 240-watt GaN power charger is no bigger than a standard charger, yet it can power the entire system, graphics included. Just make sure to actually use both sides of the included charger to get the full performance.\n\nThe Framework laptops were conceived and designed before the recent changes in laptop pricing. You can now buy a really great laptop for $650—even less during big sales events. Unfortunately, Framework's pricing doesn't tend to change, and the company doesn't sell through third-party retailers. But there's an audience for a repairable, sustainable, and now more powerful laptop—whether you want it to run Linux or Windows.

That’s the case with the Mui Board, a smart home controller built into a piece of wood.\n\nThe Mui was first demoed at CES in 2019, and I’ve seen it at several shows over the years, in various iterations, always with the promise that it would ship soon. Well, this year it did (in limited quantities!), and I finally got to try one out in my living room.\n\nMui Board $ 799 $ 999 20 % off $ 799 A minimalist smart home controller made from a piece of wood, the Mui Board works with Matter, Sonos, Hue, and others. It takes a new approach to how we interact with technology in our homes. Read More $799 at indiegogo$849 at Mui\n\nWood with Wi-Fi\n\nThe Mui Board is a screenless touch interface for my smart lights, Sonos speakers, and other devices. I installed it below these Nanoleaf panels, which also double as smart home buttons.\n\nYou could call the Mui Board an anti-smart display. A Raspberry Pi-based smart home controller with Matter support, it’s just a piece of wood on your wall when not in use. But when you touch its capacitive surface, glowing dot-matrix icons appear, letting you control your music and lighting, set timers, view messages, and access other information you might use a smart display for.\n\nThe idea is that technology should blend into your home — be calm, accessible, and integrated, not jarring or distracting. Mui is a Japanese term for being in harmony with nature, and the device is certified by the Calm Tech Institute. As someone surrounded by screens and smart displays in my home, I have long been intrigued by Mui’s alternative approach and was excited to try it out.\n\nI’ve had the Mui Board second gen in my home for a few days now, and while I haven’t had a chance to fully put it through its paces, I’ve been impressed by its responsiveness, thoughtful design, and ambitious scope.\n\nThe second-gen model debuted in 2023 but only became available for purchase earlier this year on Mui and Indiegogo. At $999 (on sale for $799), the Mui Board still feels closer to a beautifully realized concept than a mass-market product. It’s hard to imagine many people spending a thousand dollars on a smart home controller — but for the right person, it’s undeniably delightful.\n\nA simpler smart home controller\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 7 This is my “home screen,” which includes weather, Sonos speaker control, and lighting and smart home controls.\n\nCreated by Japan-based Mui Labs, the Mui Board comes in two colors: natural maple or dark cherry. I am testing the maple version and have mounted it on the wall in my living room, just above my sofa.\n\nFrom there, I can reach up and tap it to see the time or weather, check what’s playing on my Sonos system, control my Hue lights, set a timer, and see the latest headlines from The Verge via a neat RSS feed feature.\n\nIt’s a simple interface with minimalist icons that offer more control than you might expect at first glance. You can dim and turn lights on and off (no color changing), adjust a thermostat’s temperature, mode, and fan speed, open and close curtains and locks, and turn smart plugs on and off. What’s different from other smart home controllers with touch interfaces is that there are no ads, no chatty voice assistant, and no bright, distracting display vying for my attention.\n\nSpecs: Mui Board Price: $999\n\nDimensions: 23 x 3 x 1 inches\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi (2.4Ghz), BLE\n\nSmart home protocols: Matter Controller, Echonet Lite, Web API\n\nInstallation: Wall-mounted\n\nHardware: Speaker and microphone\n\nOut of the box, the Mui Board connects to Wi-Fi and can display the time and weather. You can set timers, alarms, and reminders, and send messages to other Mui boards or the Mui app. It has two small built-in speakers and a microphone for recording messages, and is powered by an included AC adapter.\n\nTouching and drawing on the Mui Board is its best feature. It’s responsive and easy to use, and it has some delightful features. A small cat roams around the board and changes direction when you tap it. There’s a piano / drum mode that turns the board into a music machine, and you write messages on it by hand, not with a keyboard. It feels like technology you can play with.\n\nSmart home integrations\n\nThe Mui Board is a great concept, and I found it useful, especially for controlling my Sonos speakers. But it does look a bit like a two-by-four on my wall.\n\nFor smart home control, the Mui Board supports Matter and integrates with Sonos, Philips Hue, LIFX, SwitchBot, Ecobee, and Google Calendar APIs, among others, plus several Japanese services, including Radiko and the Echonet smart home protocol.\n\nUsing the fairly simple Mui app, I connected the board to my Sonos system, and it displayed the title of the currently playing track, volume, and playback controls, and I could skip forward or back in my playlist.\n\nAs a Matter controller, it can set up and control supported Matter devices directly, without using Amazon, Google, Apple, or similar services. It works with lighting, plugs, and thermostats, with locks next on the roadmap.\n\nIt currently supports Matter over Wi-Fi, with Thread support planned. There’s no Thread radio onboard, so you’ll need a third-party border router. Lighting works best so far, while the other categories are still in limited testing.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n1 / 3 The Mui app is very simple; this is the homepage.\n\nI successfully added a Meross Matter Wi-Fi smart plug directly to the board but struggled to pair some Matter devices, such as my Nest thermostat, using Matter’s multi-admin feature. I plan to do more testing here.\n\nI was able to connect my Hue lighting setup and could turn on and off all the lights or control each individually on the board. It was fairly slow, however, probably because I have a large Hue setup, and it was using the cloud API rather than a local connection. I really liked the Veil of Night feature that lets you draw a line on the board to set a timer that gradually dims the lighting.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 5 Installing the Mui Board.\n\nUltimately, the Mui Board is a big button / switch for controlling your smart home, with the benefit of icons to guide you to what you’re doing without a bright screen. As with any icon-based control, it takes a bit of learning to remember which icon does what, but you can customize the layout to put your most-used controls on the first screen and scroll through additional screens for more options.\n\nWhile I love the natural, furniture-like feel, when the board is off, it slightly resembles a two-by-four mounted on the wall — as if my husband abandoned a DIY project halfway through. A rounded edge, more sculptural profile, or small shelf accessory would go a long way toward softening the look. Also, there’s the issue of what to do with the cable.\n\nI installed the Mui in our living room, but after using it for a few days, I think the ideal place for this is in a bedroom, over a bedside table or headboard. That’s the room most people would like to keep screens out of, yet still want to control lights, locks, music, etc., without reaching for a phone or using voice.\n\nI don’t see using Mui Board exclusively as a smart home controller; its software doesn’t feel quite there yet for creating scenes and automations. But as an interface to your smart home, it’s a breath of fresh air. And as a fun device for controlling music, setting timers, and playing the piano, it’s successful, if very, very expensive.\n\nIt’s been a slow burn to get the Mui Board to where it is today, and I’m intrigued to see where this thoughtful company takes its calm tech concept next. Mui Labs will be at CES again this year, where the company plans to debut a new well-being-focused sleep experience and “movement-based lighting control” for the Mui Board.\n\nPhotos and video by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-03T09:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T14:24:16.931561"}

That’s the first Strange Thing.\n\nA little background. Just about every mall is struggling now, but the Neshaminy Mall in Bensalem, Pennsylvania is more or less comatose. As Defector’s Dan McQuade, a lifelong Pennsylvanian and mall fan, wrote in his fond remembrance of the shopping center, the once bustling complex is mostly a shuttered ghost town, with half of it set to be demolished. There are only two real reasons to go there: a well-stocked Barnes & Noble and the AMC movie theater.\n\nAnd people do go there for the movie theater. It’s one of only three theaters in the Philly area with an IMAX screen, making it a destination for fans of prestige formats. I’m there often in my job as a critic, and I’m used to the IMAX auditorium being a full house. The parking lot outside of the theater at 8PM on New Year’s Eve, the night it’s showing Stranger Things 5: The Finale, however, was on another level. The concession line was overwhelming (tickets were free, but to reserve a spot guests bought a $20 concession voucher), and waits for snacks more involved than popcorn, soda, and candy were substantial. The energy was infectious. It was the most crowded I’ve seen a theater since Barbenheimer.\n\nThis was disconcerting. I knew, intellectually, that Stranger Things was a big deal. Netflix, notoriously opaque but quite ruthless in pruning shows that do not meet whatever metrics it does not share, has always treated the show like its Avengers or Star Wars. Regular PR blasts trumpet all manner of impressive stats, new episodes cause the service to crash, and the cast and iconography show up in ads and brand deals that no other Netflix show gets. Season 4 put Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” back on the charts, one of many nostalgic hits the show has brought roaring back. Even in the dodgy world of streaming data, it’s clear Stranger Things has a big audience and remains a phenomenon even if later seasons are not the critical darlings the first was. It can be much harder to feel this.\n\nThere are many potential reasons: an increasingly fractured internet, the diffuse and curatorial nature of online fandom, Netflix’s conversation-killing binge-release strategy, and long gaps between seasons that snuffed out any sense of momentum. There’s also the show itself. Analyzing Stranger Things is not that difficult; the show has always more or less just meant what it said. There was no mystery it proposed that its characters wouldn’t solve, no reference that the show’s creators wouldn’t talk about (either themselves or through the show), and its narrative was almost entirely unconcerned with the world beyond Hawkins, Indiana. Even the Upside Down, the show’s other-dimensional realm of horrors, is so barren and empty that the final season declares its true nature to be a bridge and not a place, linking our world to the actual home of the show’s supernatural horrors. (And another surprisingly barren landscape.)\n\nIn practice, this makes Stranger Things a show that feels complex, but is quite easy to follow. Which also makes it the sort of thing all kinds of people would watch together. And maybe even drive out to a dead mall for on New Year’s Eve.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nThe second Strange Thing: According to the woman who scanned my ticket, this was the busiest she had seen this theater since Black Friday 2024, the weekend Gladiator II and Wicked both premiered. Back then, she remembers being told that theater staff expected 8,000 people for the day. On this night, they expected a crowd of 1,000 people to turn up over one hour.\n\nI saw entire families, many in pajamas. Friends young and old. Lots of couples. There were Hellfire Club T-shirts, Demogorgon crowns and popcorn buckets (purchased in advance, from Target). Everyone was taking group selfies, posting photos or Instagram Reels of how crowded the concession area was. It’s New Year’s Eve, and everyone is having a ball.\n\nBehind me in the concession line I met a woman named Gia who came with her daughters. They had been watching together since the first season in 2016 and love that the show’s exciting, “with lots of things happening.” They told me that they were nervous for the finale, “scared that people will die.”\n\n”I like the nostalgia it brings to me, even though I didn’t grow up in the ’80s.”\n\nThere was a lot of that sort of talk. I overheard someone saying they thought Dustin was going to die, despite Steve’s efforts to save him. In the bathroom just before showtime, a teenager lamented how long his little brother was taking to wash his hands. “I swear to god,” he said. “If I miss a single fucking minute of this I’ll kill myself.”\n\nI met one couple, Adam and Tiffany, who drove an hour to be there. Recently engaged and in their late 20s and early 30s, they began watching Stranger Things individually, as teenagers, before they started watching together. (He said this was season 3; she said it’s 4.)\n\n“I like the nostalgia it brings to me, even though I didn’t grow up in the ’80s,” Adam said. He grew up watching E.T. and The Goonies, so he feels an affinity for the era in spite of his youth. He also loved the government conspiracy elements. “The first season it was really prevalent, with the MK Ultra stuff that it depicted. People didn’t know about it and it was a great way to expose people to it. I really enjoy that attitude the first season had and it kind of continues, especially in the latest season — the government does not always have your best interest in mind.”\n\nTiffany, for her part, feels like “we really have grown to know and love all of the characters, you know? I’m not ready to cry tonight.”\n\nI must confess that I was continually surprised by all of this. I’ve grown accustomed to the asynchronous way most modern entertainment is enjoyed and discussed — often apologetically, as everyone triangulates how much of which shows they’ve seen and can talk about. Sports are among the only reliably communal experiences we get in front of our screens. Television as the characters on Stranger Things experienced it was communal, in shared living spaces where the screen fought for attention with the world around it. Television as Stranger Things fans have experienced it is virtually private, watched on a phone or laptop or TV at your convenience.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nOne last Strange Thing: Even for me, a Stranger Things hater, watching the finale in a packed house was frankly incredible. The crowd cheered early and often: when fan favorite Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) is saved from plummeting to his doom by his rival Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton); when newly minted fan-favorite character Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly) gives the villainous Vecna the finger with his “Suck my fat one!” catchphrase; when Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) stares down the massive, arachnid Mind Flayer in the finale’s climactic battle. When a character is thought to have died, a chorus of sniffles works its way through the room.\n\nThere is a sincerity to Stranger Things that is at odds with the cynicism of its marketing and imitators. The Duffer brothers are enthusiastic imitators that are happy to share their crib sheet, but they’ve always been open about what they’ve intended with Stranger Things. Despite all the dissonant things they’ve put inside of it as the show grew in every possible way, hopscotching from genre to genre often nonsensically, it remains a coming-of-age story about all the ways one can grow up.\n\nIt’s the secret weapon of the show, the way it’s not just about the four D&D-playing kids getting older, but their older siblings on the cusp of adulthood or their parents who sank into bad patterns and had to do some growing of their own. In this last season, the show leaned into its age, introducing younger siblings who are about to face things the core four did; caring for them is their final step to maturity.\n\nStranger Things’ relentless focus on nostalgia can make it easy to forget the present it aired in, and what it must have been like to grow up in that time. If you were a child watching it, you were a child watching when Donald Trump was elected the first time, when covid-19 took the world out from under you, when social media let our worst horrors beat a path right to your pocket. Your very own personal Upside Down.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\n“Life has been so unfair to you, so cruel,” Jim Hopper (David Harbour) tells his surrogate daughter early on in the finale, when Eleven is committed to dying in her fight against Vecna because she believes she doesn’t belong in the world anymore. He tells her to fight to imagine a life beyond the horror. “I know you don’t believe you can have any of this. But I promise you, we will find a way to make it real. You will find a way to make it real, because you have to. Because you deserve it.”\n\nIt’s a line that collapses the fourth wall, escaping the Hawkins / Upside Down of this movie-fueled vision of 1987 to crash right into the final moments of 2025. The roomful of fans, young and old, here with their families and partners and friends, taking selfies, hooting and hollering, haven’t just spent 10 years with characters on TV that feel like friends. They’ve grown up, and watched each other grow up, through hell. And the kids, young adults, and grown-ups of Stranger Things have gone through hell with them. A ludicrous, nonsensical nightmare parade that has, in some ways, rendered them unrecognizable from the people they were 10 years ago, the way bookish Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer) has now become a rifle-toting monster slayer.\n\nMarking the end of that journey in a theater full of people who have been on it with you? What a way to close out a year. What a nice note to start a new one on, going back out into the world with all your fellow fans, looking for the right side up.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-03T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T16:34:28.684464"}

The responses were decidedly mixed.\n\nCredit to Anthropic and Google, whose respective Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 3 models gave timely responses. Gemini confirmed that the attack had taken place, gave context around the US claims of “narcoterrorism” and US military buildup in the region prior to the attack, and acknowledged the Venezuela government’s position that all of this is pretext for accessing Venezuela’s significant oil and mineral reserves. It cited 15 sources along the way, ranging from Wikipedia to The Guardian to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nClaude initially balked. “I don't have any information about the United States invading Venezuela or capturing Nicolás Maduro. This hasn't happened as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2025,” it responded. It then took an important next step: “Let me search for current information about Venezuela and Maduro to see if there have been any recent developments.”\n\nThe chatbot then listed 10 news sources—including NBC News but also Breitbart—and gave a brisk four-paragraph summary of the morning’s events, providing a link to a new source after nearly every sentence.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:03:15 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T16:34:29.002434"}

We are not going to let that happen,” he said. “We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.”\n\nTrump explained that the leadership of Venezuela will be in the hands of high-ranking US officials, including secretary of state Marco Rubio and secretary of defense Pete Hegseth.\n\nAt the same time, María Corina Machado, considered the main leader of the opposition to Maduro and Hugo Chávez and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, issued a statement in which she stated that opposition party figure Edmundo González Urrutia must immediately assume the presidency of the country.\n\n“This is the time of the citizens.

The Delete Act, passed in 2023, was supposed to simplify things, allowing residents to make a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information.\n\nNow the Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) actually gives residents the ability to make that request.

Other information, such as sensitive medical information, may be covered under other laws like HIPAA.\n\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency says that in addition to giving residents more control over their data, the tool could result in fewer “unwanted texts, calls, or emails” and also decrease the “risk of identity theft, fraud, AI impersonations, or that your data is leaked or hacked.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Thanks to its revolutionary Pleasure Air Technology that mimics the feeling of oral sex, not only has Womanizer discovered a way to stimulate the 10,000+ nerve endings in the clitoris in a way that hadn’t been done by a sex toy before—yes, they were the first—but the brand can even boast a 100% orgasm rate among users.\n\nAs a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2, both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance, the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm.\n\nBut because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you. That’s where Womanizer coupons come into play—because no one should have to decide on just one of their fantastic sex toys.\n\nSave 12% on Everything With Our Exclusive Womanizer Coupon\n\nIf you’ve been wanting to try Womanizer, but you were holding out for a sale or deal, then I’m happy to announce that we have a great one for you. At checkout, use the Womanizer promo code and you’ll score 12% off everything sitewide, including sale products.\n\nWhat Makes the Womanizer Premium 2 so Popular?\n\nOverwhelmed and not sure where you should begin your Womanizer journey? Womanizer Premium 2 is the perfect start to a life-long love affair with Womanizer. It’s easy to use, has 12 intensity levels, and you can even set it to Womanizer Autopilot so you can focus 100% on being in the moment. It’s also waterproof should you want to experiment with its sensations in the shower or bathtub.\n\nGet 15% off Sitewide With a Womanizer Coupon Code\n\nLooking to level up on the Womanizer deals? If you sign up on the website, you’ll get a Womanizer coupon code emailed directly to you. Valid for seven days, this unique code will get you 15% off everything on the site and can even be combined with other Womanizer discounts.\n\nThis gives you a great opportunity to purchase the Womanizer Premium 2, so your original Premium has a buddy. If you travel a lot for work or for pleasure and need something smaller, but just as powerful, then put that promo code toward the Womanizer Liberty 2 or Womanizer Starlet Snow. Both are ideal for the person who’s always on the go, but also prioritizes sexual pleasure.\n\nShop Womanizer Sales and Get up to 50% off Sex Toys\n\nWomanizer isn’t just great at keeping people with vulva knee-deep in orgasms, but doing so with your budget in mind. Because sexual pleasure should be affordable and accessible for everyone, the Womanizer sale offers up to 50% off certain products at all times. It’s a great selection of Womanizer sale items that showcase just how diverse the brand is. On the sale page, you won’t just find Pleasure Air Technology sex toys, but vibrators and penis strokers too. It’s a great way to get yourself a little something and feel good knowing that it was a total bargain.\n\nHow to Get a Free Toy With Purchase\n\nLet’s be honest: the best things in life are free. Because Womanizer knows that and realizes we all deserve a freebie from time-to-time, they want to make your day. With every Womanizer order over $199, you get a free Womanizer toy at checkout.

Pretty much every building lets in a lot of particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and vaporous chemicals. Not to mention off-gassing from indoor plastics, furniture, and paint. It’s important to ensure that the air you’re breathing is clean—from stopping coughs and allergy symptoms to helping us wake up with clearer sinuses and less raspy throats—air purifiers can make all the difference. AirDoctor makes a myriad of efficient air purifiers for every type of home, and we have AirDoctor promo codes and deals to help you save big on clean air.\n\nGet $400 Off With AirDoctor Coupon\n\nWith something as serious as the health of your home, it’s important to act now and stay prepared. We know air purifiers can be pricey, and AirDoctor has made it more accessible for all. In preparation for the launch of their newest air purifying system, the AirDoctor 4000, you’ll get an extra $400 off when you pre-order (a total of $400 in savings instead of $800 under regular pricing). Their sleek design has advanced triple filtration and 360-degree air intake that traps 99.99% of particles, like allergens, smoke, mold, and bacteria.\n\nSave 15% on AirDoctor Filter Combo Packs\n\nWe all know buying in bulk is the cheaper option almost always (See Costco, Sam’s Club, et. al), and purifying your home’s air is no different. AirDoctor has a deal right now, where you’ll save 15% when you purchase a filter combo pack (as opposed to individual filters). There’s no promo code required, either, so all you need to do is add it to your cart and you’re golden.\n\nWhat Does an AirDoctor Purifier Do?\n\nAs mentioned at the top, air purifiers can help clean the air in your home, especially against some of those less-known (or noticed) toxins on top of everyday things like smoke, paint, and pet dander. We know the importance of clean air, and that’s why we’ve set up a handy guide on How to Buy an Air Purifier, including important, but often overlooked points, like how to fit your room to an air purifier and how to best pick out one that will best fit your home’s needs. We also have spent months testing air purifiers, and have rounded up the Best Air Purifiers for your home, including our picks for small or large rooms, and those with built-in fans or heaters.\n\nWe thought the AirDoctor Smart 5500i was the best purifier for PM 2.5 and gases because it captures fine particulates with its HEPA filters and gases with its dual action/carbon volatile organic compound trap filters, all while exchanging the air four times an hour in a 1,000-square-foot space. The purifier also has a handy alert to let you know when it is time to change the filter. There are tons of different AirDoctor options for various sized rooms, so make sure you read our guides and measure your home before purchasing to ensure you have the best AirDoctor air purifier for your space.\n\nBest AirDoctor Air Purifier for Mold and Pets in 2025\n\nAs a cat parent living with someone who suffers from cat allergies, I know just how important an air purifier is to keep your home clean. One of the best air purifiers on the market is the AirDoctor 3500, which is great at tackling mold and pet dander. It’s ideal for medium to large rooms like your bedroom, living room, or kitchen. It’s great for rooms with a lot of odors, as it circulates 630 square feet four times per hour to give you continuous clean air, and it also has 3-stage filtration with UltraHEPA.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 07:14:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T07:53:25.048655"}

Here’s how to make sure you’re one of the most locked-down ones out there.", "content": "WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, with over 3 billion users. But its ubiquity also makes it a target for attackers. In December, security researchers documented a new form of account hijacking called GhostPairing, which sees users tricked into linking an attacker’s browser to their WhatsApp device.\n\nMeanwhile, in November, Austrian researchers plugged billions of numbers into WhatsApp’s contact discovery tool to create “the most extensive exposure of phone numbers” ever—along with profile photos and more.\n\nWhatsApp is protected by end-to-end encryption, the gold standard of security that, when implemented properly, means only you and the person you’re chatting with can read your messages. Behind the scenes, WhatsApp has also launched passkey-encrypted backups and privacy-enhanced AI technology.\n\nBut there are a bunch of features you can use to boost your own privacy and security in the Meta-owned app. Here are eight of the best.\n\nPrivacy Checkup\n\nA good place to start is WhatsApp’s Privacy Checkup feature in Settings under Privacy, which allows you to control who sees data such as your profile photo, About information, and status. You can also add extra privacy to your profile by adjusting the last Seen/Online setting to Nobody.\n\nFrom there, you can choose who is able to contact you on WhatsApp by blocking unwanted calls and messages. It’s also possible to specify who can add you to groups, silence unknown callers, and manage your blocked contacts.\n\nDisappearing Messages\n\nWhile WhatsApp is protected by end-to-end encryption, your messages can be read if you are compromised by spyware or if someone gains physical access to your device.\n\nOne way of helping to secure chats against this is disappearing messages, which allows you to set a period of time for texts to stay visible before they are deleted. Messages can be set to disappear after 24 hours, seven days, or 90 days after they’re sent.\n\nDisappearing messages can be set for all chats or for specific conversations. To enable the feature as default for new one-to-one chats, go to Settings > Privacy > Default message timer and set the time frame for messages to disappear.\n\nJust keep in mind that the feature requires trust—anyone can screenshot a message, so you can’t guarantee that what you’ve sent will be deleted everywhere all the time.\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication Including a Security PIN\n\nWhatsApp needs your phone number when you set up an account, but this can also leave it open to various security and privacy risks. A feature that will protect your WhatsApp account from such threats such is a security PIN.\n\nThe PIN works as two-factor authentication to protect your chats from prying eyes. Open WhatsApp Settings. Tap Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN. Enter a PIN of your choice and confirm it.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T11:21:21.576042"}

{"title": "Protein Bars: Gluten-Free, Whole Foods, Fiber (2026)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/best-protein-bars/", "summary": "What to prioritize, what to skip, when to enjoy—plus, we’ve selected WIRED's favorite bars worth trying.", "content": "Think of protein bars as grab-and-go snacks, not meal replacements. They're most helpful when whole foods aren't available or when your schedule won't allow for a proper meal. The most beneficial sources of protein come with fiber, healthy fats, and other nutrients. (That’s why registered dietitians recommend whole foods over ultra-processed alternatives.) So, while high-protein snacks may boast impressive counts on the label, they’re not always the healthiest option.\n\nAfter consulting the nutrition experts about key ingredients to look for (and what to avoid), we've rounded up the best protein bars that meet those standards. For more tips on protein, check out our guide to the Best Protein Powders and How Much Protein Do I Need?\n\nWhat Should I Look For in a Protein Bar?\n\nStart with the Nutrition Facts label. The first thing to check is serving size, since every number on the label applies to that portion. For most protein bars, one bar equals one serving, but it’s still worth confirming.\n\nScan the Calories\n\nWhat’s “right” depends on your caloric needs. If it’s a snack between meals, around the 200-calorie range generally makes sense. If you’re trying to gain weight or looking for a meal replacement, you might want something closer to 350 calories. That said, experts don’t recommend protein bars as stand-ins for meals. They’re best used to supplement whole foods, which offer a wider range of nutrients that snack bars just can’t replicate.\n\nCheck the Protein Content and Source\n\n“Ideally, we’d like to see protein bars offer 10 to 20 grams of protein,” says Jamie Mok, registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Just as important as the quantity is the source; protein derived from milk, soy, peas, or nuts are all common, effective options.\n\nDon’t Forget Fiber\n\nFiber helps stabilize blood sugar, supports digestion, curbs cravings, and keeps you fuller for longer. According to Mok, around 5 grams of fiber per energy bar is a good benchmark, preferably from whole-food ingredients, like nuts, seeds, or oats.\n\nIngredients to Avoid\n\nIn general, the shorter and more recognizable the ingredient list, the better. High-protein bars can be as delicious as a Snickers. “They could also sneakily pack a lot of added sugar, and turn into a candy bar,” says Mok. There’s no official cutoff, but around 5 grams of added sugar or less is a reasonable benchmark. Check both the nutritional label and ingredient list: Syrups and concentrates are usually indicators of added sugars.\n\nMany brands lower their sugar count by using sugar alcohols (like erythritol, maltitol, or sorbitol). These provide fewer calories than sugar and don’t spike blood glucose the same way, but they can cause bloating, gas, or GI discomfort for some people, especially in higher doses. If you notice stomach issues after eating protein bars, sugar alcohols are often the culprit. You might tolerate one bar just fine, but eating several in a day can get uncomfortable.\n\nIt’s also worth limiting bars that rely heavily on hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, which are more processed forms of fat, as well as those packed with long lists of artificial sweeteners (i.e., sucralose), colors, or flavors.\n\nOur Favorite Protein Bars\n\nBest Overall\n\nRxBar now offers a couple of different protein bars, but the Classic 12G remains the best.

{"title": "15 Best Electrolyte Powders (2026): Tasty and Effective", "link": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-electrolyte-powders/", "summary": "Get those lost minerals back with the help of our top picks.", "content": "TL;DR Don't choose something with ultra-high amounts of sodium, carbohydrates, or sugar unless you need to based on your exercise levels or a sweat test.\n\nAmy Brownstein, a registered dietitian and nutritionist at MyNetDiary, says electrolytes are minerals that exist naturally in your body. These include magnesium, calcium, chloride, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous. Electrolyte powders usually contain these, as well as sugars and carbohydrates which can help a little bit with the absorption of the electrolytes.\n\nShelley Balls, a registered dietitian and nutritionist, says humans usually lose sodium when working out or spending time in hot temperatures and also that carbohydrates are important to help replenish and preserve muscle glycogen stores to prevent fatigue, especially if you'll be active for more than 30 minutes. Basically, if you're working out a lot and not replenishing lost carbs, you'll feel fatigued much faster—and that's especially true for intense workouts or long sporting events, in which case she recommends re-upping carbohydrates every 30 to 45 minutes. Sugars like glucose serve similar purposes, helping to replenish muscle glycogen as well.\n\nIf you're just looking for supplements for day-to-day life or to soothe your hungover brain, you don't need as much sodium or carbohydrates. Brownstein says to choose a powder within the context of your daily habits and diet; most people already consume the recommended 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, so if you're not depleting sodium stores with intense exercise, you probably don't need a powder with a high sodium content. The same can be said for sugar.\n\nUltimately, the best way to figure out exactly what you need is by getting a sweat test done to analyze the contents of your sweat. But short of doing that, your best bet is to choose a powder that lives somewhere in the middle of ingredient concentration—unless you're sweating a ton, working out in high heat, or training in high altitudes. Brownstein adds that if you notice white, chalky residue on your skin or clothes after working out, you might need to up your sodium intake.\n\nWhen it comes to synthetic dyes, Balls says that it comes down mostly to personal choice. Luckily, if you want to avoid these ingredients, many of our recommendations omit them.\n\nTo avoid stomach upset, Balls mentions that you might want to look for powders that are lower in magnesium (which can have a laxative effect in high amounts). She also mentions that calcium and iron can interfere with the absorption of one another, so choose a powder that has balanced, lower amounts of those two supplements. Brownstein mentions that high sugar and sodium content can upset some peoples' stomachs too, and that you should read the labels to make sure you're not over-supplementing (or over-caffeinating). If something contains 100 percent of your daily recommended zinc content, for example, you want to make sure you're not also taking a multivitamin with the same amount of zinc.\n\nPer Heather Gosnell, a pediatrician, sodium is the key ingredient for effective rehydration. She also says a little sugar and carbohydrates help your body absorb water but to avoid high-sugar drinks.\n\nBalls says to look for a powder that includes the key electrolytes lost: sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. She says, if possible, to avoid drinks with artificial sweeteners.\n\nHallie Zwibel, director of the Center for Sports Medicine at New York Institute of Technology, adds that “in addition to causing upset stomach and reduced fluid absorption, repeatedly consuming high-sugar foods and beverages can lead to diabetes, as well as potential weight gain.” He also said, “While electrolyte packets can help replenish essential minerals lost through sweat, they should not replace daily water intake.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:31:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T12:52:41.085877"}

Now, they’ve shown that their problems can be rewritten in the concrete language of algorithms.", "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nAll of modern mathematics is built on the foundation of set theory, the study of how to organize abstract collections of objects. But in general, research mathematicians don’t need to think about it when they’re solving their problems. They can take it for granted that sets behave the way they’d expect, and carry on with their work.\n\nDescriptive set theorists are an exception. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets—particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore.\n\nTheir field just got a lot less lonely. In 2023, a mathematician named Anton Bernshteyn published a deep and surprising connection between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science.\n\nHe showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. The bridge connecting the disciplines surprised researchers on both sides. Set theorists use the language of logic, computer scientists the language of algorithms. Set theory deals with the infinite, computer science with the finite. There’s no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent.\n\n“This is something really weird,” said Václav Rozhoň, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “Like, you are not supposed to have this.”\n\nSince Bernshteyn’s result, his peers have been exploring how to move back and forth across the bridge to prove new theorems on either side, and how to extend that bridge to new classes of problems.

The buds cost $199 and will come with a year-long subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked.\n\nThe startup is also trying to compete with AI-powered voice dictation apps such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monolouge, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model.\n\nIn a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was speaking in a whispering tone.\n\n“We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call.\n\nLast year, companies like Sandbar and Pebble launched rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with app, it wants to provide functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package.\n\nUsers can place a pre-order of these buds using the startup’s site.

Whether it’s worth the price to you may come down to how much you use your Xreal glasses for gaming or entertainment on the go. Xreal glasses owners have already been able to connect directly to the likes of Valve’s Steam Deck or the Asus ROG Ally for video and audio over USB-C. Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Neo doesn’t change anything except for letting you give your device some juice while you game.

Then, on the other side, there’s a USB-C charging port.\n\nIt would have been nice to have an HDMI port on the Neo — Viture’s Pro Mobile Dock has one, enabling connection to many other kinds of gadgets, like game consoles and streaming devices.

Functionally, they fit in an in-between niche for people who want immersive content or a second monitor, but without a bulky headset.\n\nRelated No one knows what to call these things\n\nAgain, Xreal’s been doing this for a while. But one change is the company is adding a Real 3D feature, which converts any 2D video content into 3D using the device’s X1 spatial computing chip. (This will also be available for One Pro owners via a software update.)\n\nI got a chance to demo this while playing Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch 2, as well as a few YouTube videos over the past few weeks. There’s obvious appeal for gaming. The 3D effect wasn’t super obvious in Mario Kart, but I could definitely tell there was added depth. It was more hit-or-miss with YouTube videos. If you’re looking at a panoramic view or car videos, the effect can be a fun extra. Watching K-pop boy band performances, you can see occasional uncanniness in upscaled 3D choreography.\n\nWhile discreet, the 1S can look a bit funky from the side when you’re in public.\n\nIf you’re big into immersive video, the main benefit is you don’t have to do anything besides enable the 3D effect in settings. You can just open up YouTube, Netflix, or perhaps your Plex server, and whatever video you pull up is 3D-ified. I don’t happen to be a 3D evangelist, as I have a tendency to get motion sickness. That said, I didn’t experience any while testing the 1S, since I mostly kept my testing to shorter videos. It’s definitely something to be aware of, however, if you plan on long 3D viewing sessions or watching motion-heavy content.\n\nI probably wouldn’t upgrade from the Xreal One to the 1S. The bumps in resolution are nice, but not that noticeable unless you’re a power user. And like I said, the 2D-to-3D conversion is convenient but iffy for certain types of content. Still, as far as portable immersive screens go, the 1S offer a nice mix between price, features, and function.\n\nThe Xreal 1S are available starting today for $449.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-04T09:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T14:23:39.993749"}

The new pin brings a physical button that lets you start and stop the recording. Plus, during the recording, you can tap the button to highlight a certain point — just like you can do on the newly launched Plaud Note Pro.\n\nOne nice thing about the $179 Plaud NotePin S is that you get a clip, a lanyard, a magnetic pin, and a wristband in the package. That means you can wear the device however you like. The company is also adding Apple Find My support for the pin, so that you can easily look for the device if you can’t find it.\n\nThe core specifications of the device remain the same from the previous generation. There is 64GB of onboard storage with a battery capacity of 20 hours of continuous recording. The device has two MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics that can capture clear audio within 9.8 feet of range. Users will get 300 minutes of transcription per month for free and\n\nAs compared to the Note Pro, this device has a shorter recording range and lower battery life. But it is smaller in size to carry using any of the above mentioned accesories. The company said that the pin is suited for people who are constantly on the go.\n\nImage Credits: Plaud\n\nThis is Plaud’s fourth device, and the company has sold more than 1.5 million devices until now. With these devices, the focus has been on in-person meetings. However, Plaud also wants to take on meeting notetakers like Granola, Fathom, and Fireflies with a new desktop client that works across meeting apps. The company said that the app can detect when a meeting is active and prompt you to capture the transcript.\n\nThe Mac app takes notes using system audio to capture the meeting, and then structures the transcription into notes using AI. The company introduced multimodal inputs for notetaking with its app that allows users to add images and typed notes along with audio transcription last year. Plaud is bringing that functionality to its desktop app as well.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:28:10 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T16:32:09.840516"}

The smart home company is launching the Onero H1, which it calls “the most accessible AI household robot.” The announcement follows last year’s debut of its multitasking household bot — a robot vacuum mounted to a mobile platform.\n\nSwitchBot says the Onero is a general-use humanoid robot designed to eliminate housework that can complete “everyday actions such as grasping, pushing, opening, and organizing, while learning to adapt across different tasks and home scenarios.”\n\nA video the company shared ahead of the show demonstrated the Onero doing household tasks like filling a coffee machine, making breakfast, washing the windows, loading a washing machine, and folding and putting away clothes.\n\nThe Onero isn’t a full humanoid; it has articulated arms and hands, and a face, but no legs. Its long, oblong body sits on a wheeled base for mobility, an evolution of SwitchBot’s modular multitasking bot.\n\nAccording to the company, the Onero uses multiple cameras in its head, arms, hands, and midsection to power its perception. It also has an impressive 22 degrees of freedom (DoF), referring to the number of independent movements it can make. For comparison, Boston Dynamics’ Atlas’ upper body has 29 DoF.\n\nImage: SwitchBot\n\nThe Onero uses an on-device OmniSense vision-language-action (VLA) model that enables the robot to learn and adapt by combining visual perception, depth awareness, and tactile feedback to understand an object’s position, shape, and interaction states.\n\nThis should enable it to perform the household tasks shown in the demo video. However, as anyone who’s followed the adventures of humanoid robots this past year will know, video demos are very different from the real thing. I’ll be getting some one-on-one time with the Onero on the show floor this week and will report back.\n\nImage: SwitchBot\n\nSwitchBot says the Onero was “developed as the next step in SwitchBot’s journey from specialized devices to multi-task systems.” This speaks to a central tension in household robotics. Do we want single-purpose bots that do one thing well, such as robot vacuums? Or do we want generalist robots that can adapt to a variety of tasks? Many household chores remain difficult or impractical to automate without fundamentally changing our homes. It’s an interesting dilemma, and one I hope to see innovative solutions for at CES this year.\n\nIn the near term, something in between feels more realistic for most homes. A smarter robot that can orchestrate the devices in our homes, not necessarily complete the tasks itself — an embodied smart home assistant. SwitchBot says the Onero is designed to work with its existing ecosystem of task-specific robots, which include robot vacuums, air purifiers, and humidifiers, and orchestration of connected devices is the premise behind Samsung’s Ballie and LG’s AI agent.\n\nNone of these bots would have much luck in my home, as I have stairs, and they all use wheels. However, SwitchBot does have a leg up on both Ballie and LG’s bots — the company says the Onero H1 and its robotic arms A1 will soon be available for preorder on SwitchBot’s website.

The new NotePin S is almost identical to the original, except for one major difference: a button. It’s joined by a new Plaud Desktop app for recording audio in online meetings, which is free to owners of any Plaud Note or NotePin.\n\nThe NotePin S has the same FitBit-esque design as the 2024 original and ships with a lanyard, wristband, clip, and magnetic pin, so you can wear it just about any way you please — now all included in the box, whereas before the lanyard and wristband were sold separately.\n\nIt’s about the same size as the NotePin, comes in the same colors (black, purple, or silver), offers similar battery life, and still supports Apple Find My. Like the NotePin, it records audio and generates transcriptions and summaries, whether those are meeting notes, action points, or reminders.\n\nBut now it has a button. Whereas the first NotePin used haptic controls, relying on a long squeeze to start recording, with a short buzz to let you know it worked, the S switches to something simpler. A long press of the button starts recording, a short tap adds highlight markers. Plaud’s explanation for the change is simple: buttons are less ambiguous, so you’ll always know you’ve successfully pressed it and started recording, whereas original NotePin users complained they sometimes failed to record because they hadn’t squeezed just right.\n\nAI recorders like this live or die by ease of use, so removing a little friction gives Plaud better odds of survival.\n\nThe NotePin S not only includes a button, but its wristband and lanyard accessories now come included.

Plaud Desktop runs in the background and activates whenever it detects calls from apps including Zoom, Meet, and Teams, recording both system audio and from your microphone. You can set it to either record meetings automatically or require manual activation, and unlike some alternatives it doesn’t create a bot that joins the call with you.\n\nRecordings and notes are synced with those from Plaud’s line of hardware recorders, with the same models used for transcription and generation, creating a “seamless” library of audio from your meetings, both online and off.\n\nPlaud Desktop is available now and is free to anyone who already owns a Plaud Note or NotePin device.

Much less certain is how US companies will actually access them—or if they even want to.", "content": "President Donald Trump has made it clear: His vision for Venezuela’s future involves the US profiting from its oil.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies—the biggest anywhere in the world—go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,” the president told reporters at a news conference Saturday, following the shocking capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife.\n\nBut experts caution that a number of realities—including international oil prices and longer-term questions of stability in the country—are likely to make this oil revolution much harder to execute than Trump seems to think.\n\n\"The disconnect between the Trump administration and what's really going on in the oil world, and what American companies want, is huge,” says Lorne Stockman, an analyst with Oil Change International, a clean energy and fossil fuels research and advocacy organization.\n\nVenezuela sits on some of the largest oil reserves in the world. But production of oil there has plummeted since the mid 1990s, after President Hugo Chávez nationalized much of the industry. The country was producing just 1.3 million barrels of oil each day in 2018, down from a high of more than 3 million barrels each day in the late 1990s. (The US, the top producer of crude oil in the world, produced an average of 21.7 million barrels each day in 2023.) Sanctions placed on Venezuela during the first Trump administration, meanwhile, have driven production even further down.\n\nTrump has repeatedly implied that freeing up all that oil and increasing production would be a boon for the oil and gas industry—and that he expects American oil companies to take the lead. This kind of thinking—a natural offshoot of his “drill, baby, drill” philosophy—is typical for the president. One of Trump’s main critiques of the Iraq war, which he first voiced years before he ran for office, was that the US did not “take the oil” from the region to “reimburse ourselves” for the war.\n\nThe president views energy geopolitics “almost like the world is a Settlers of Catan board—you kidnap the president of Venezuela and, ipso facto, you now control all the oil,” says Rory Johnston, a Canadian oil market researcher. “I do think he legitimately, to a degree, believes that. It’s not true, but I think that’s an important frame for how he's justifying and driving the momentum of his policy.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 19:25:38 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T19:52:56.518975"}

The first specification, which standardizes NFC-based tap-to-unlock and UWB hands-free unlocking for smart locks, will arrive early this year, according to the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA).\n\n”We’re delighted to share that Aliro, the CSA’s standardized credential and communication protocol that lets trusted smartphones and wearables act as digital keys with smart locks and readers in your home and where you badge, has passed its final verification milestone and will come to market in Q1 2026,” Nelson Henry, Chair of the Aliro Steering Committee, told The Verge in an emailed statement.\n\nAnnounced in 2023, Aliro is an open standard for smart locks and digital keys that provides a standardized way for smart locks to communicate with smartphones and watches, regardless of manufacturer or platform.\n\nUltimately, it should mean more locks and more phones will gain the same capabilities as Apple’s Home Key feature on the iPhone. This lets you use your iPhone as a digital key to tap-to-unlock using NFC, just like you tap-to-pay. More recently, Apple added a UWB-powered hands-free unlocking option that unlocks your door as you approach.\n\nApple Home Key tap-to-unlock is a useful feature that turns your phone into a key for compatible smart locks. Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nWith Aliro, these features can now come to Android phones and other smart home platforms, so if your spouse or housemate uses a Galaxy or Pixel phone, you can both unlock the same smart lock using your own device as a key.\n\nAliro is an industry-wide collaboration, developed by Apple, Google, and Samsung, along with lock makers and chip makers, including Allegion, Assa Abloy, Qualcomm, and NXP. Several lock manufacturers have announced they plan to support Aliro, including Schlage, Kwikset, X-Things/U-Tec, Level, and Nuki.\n\nAliro-certified locks will use one or more communications options to unlock a compatible door:\n\nNear Field Communication (NFC) – tap your phone or watch to the lock to unlock\n\nBluetooth LE (BLE) – use your phone to initiate a command to unlock as you approach\n\nBLE plus Ultrawide Band (UWB) – hands-free unlocking as you approach the door with your phone in your bag or pocket\n\nLocks must have compatible radios and antennas to support these protocols, meaning that existing models may not be upgradeable to Aliro.\n\nAccording to the CSA, Aliro’s benefit over similar solutions is that it provides direct, secure communication between a phone or wearable and the lock. There is no need to open an app, and no cloud is involved; the credentials are stored on the user’s device, and communication between the device and the lock uses asymmetric encryption. Because it doesn’t use the cloud, it will work when your phone is offline or doesn’t have service, like a regular key.\n\nHenry says the CSA has made significant progress over the last two years, building the Aliro 1.0 specification, its certification program, and supporting test system. This should set it up for fast, wide adoption, and we could start to see smart locks with Aliro support arriving soon.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-04T15:00:13-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T20:29:40.076653"}

It’s definitely the Ultraloq Bolt Sense that’s the most intriguing of the bunch, however. It’s a relatively compact smart deadbolt that combines facial recognition with palm vein authentication for touch-free access, without resorting to an app.\n\nWhile palm scanning is still relatively new to the consumer market, Xthings claims it’s more reliable than fingerprint scanning because it’s actually reading the vein pattern under your skin, so it doesn’t care if your hands are wet or dirty. And, since vein scanning uses near infrared light, it doesn’t matter if it’s pitch black out, it should still work.\n\nThe Bolt Sense has built-in Wi-Fi, and Xthings says Matter support is planned. But, since it’s not expected to ship until Q2, there’s still plenty of time to work that out. The company is also announcing the Latch 7 Pro, which should be landing sooner (in Q1), and, while it lacks fancy palm-reading tech, it will support Matter-over-Thread and Aliro.\n\nXthings will also be showing off the Ulticam IQ V2 at CES, its first camera with Matter support.\n\nMore interesting, though, is the Ulticam HaLow. It will be one of the first security cameras on the market to support Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah). HaLow uses sub-GHz signals for greater range and wall penetration, but at the expense of bandwidth. While Xthings doesn’t say exactly what the maximum range is for the new Ulticam, HaLow is rated for up to 0.6 miles under normal conditions. That makes it ideal for large properties. While HaLow made a bit of a splash at CES way back in 2016, it hasn’t found much success in the real world. Rather than make you worry about tracking down a specialized router, Xthings is including a dedicated hub with the Ulticam HaLow.\n\nIf you’re more worried about capturing crystal-clear video even in the darkest nights, Xthings is also launching the Ulticam IQ Floodlight, which pairs its AI-enabled security camera with 2,000-lumen floodlights.

This time, it’s got an even tighter focus on cardiovascular and metabolic health.\n\nThe Body Scan 2 contains eight electrodes on the scale itself, as well as an additional four electrodes within a retractable handle. This is similar to the original Body Scan’s design. Adding the handle makes the Body Scan lineup more accurate than most smart scales because it incorporates upper-body data. Typical smart scales only have foot electrodes, and solely use lower-body data to extrapolate total body composition.\n\nThe major difference with the Body Scan 2 is it increases the number of biomarkers tracked. In addition to weight, heart rate, and overall body composition, the scale now adds a 90-second “longevity assessment.” The assessment consists of over 60 biomarkers that are broken down into roughly five categories: heart pumping performance and heart electrical activity, hypertension risk, artery health, cellular health and metabolic efficiency, and glycemic regulation.\n\n“We have been building this vision of adding a lot of powerful biomarkers that can be measured every day when you step on the scale,” says Antoine Joussain, Withings’ director of product management, devices.\n\nSince tracking over 60 metrics can get unwieldy, users will also get a more digestible Health Trajectory score that visualizes their healthspan — or how many years of good health a person can expect.\n\n“We want to keep it simple on a high level, so you have clear indicators that you can follow on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The rest of the 60 biomarkers, you can of course review them, but we’ll do all the interpretation for you,” Joussain says.\n\nThis isn’t a wholly new concept. Whoop introduced a similar score in 2025 with its Whoop 5.0 tracker using cardiovascular, sleep, and activity metrics to estimate how well a person is aging. Oura also launched metrics for comparing cardiovascular age and chronological age in 2024. Both companies also added on the ability to get blood tests to track metabolic health metrics last year.\n\nBut one intriguing thing about Withings’ approach with the Body Scan 2 is it’s tracking metabolic health noninvasively. Instead of blood tests, the scale utilizes something called bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) and foot sweat. Yes, foot sweat.\n\n“The goal is to stimulate the sweat glands that are inside your feet with a safe, tiny current. We measure the maximum activity response from these sweat glands. If the activity is high, to simplify a bit, it means your glands are healthy and if not, they’re not healthy,” Joussain explains. He notes that diabetes can cause foot complications, and that Withings has seen correlating evidence from its users who have poorly controlled diabetes.\n\nWithings wants people to think of scales as “longevity stations” that measure more than just weight. Image: Withings\n\nAs for BIS, the scale sends currents at different frequencies to evaluate how well cell membranes are working as another indicator for metabolic health. The benefit of these noninvasive methods, he says, is that they can be taken more frequently and easily than blood tests. That said, these metabolic features aren’t meant to be diagnostic — they’re envisioned more as early warning flags.\n\nThe benefit of collecting all this data on a smart scale, Joussain says, is it’s a convenient device many people already have and are accustomed to using regularly. That, he says, makes it the ideal gadget for taking several long-term health measurements at once. But while there’s logic to this approach, there are challenges too. Scales can be emotionally loaded gadgets that some people avoid to prevent body dysmorphia or disordered eating when setting out to improve their overall health.\n\nIt’s a problem Withings is aware of. To that end, Joussain points to an Eyes-Closed Mode, in which all measurements are replaced with emoji on the scale but are still recorded in the Withings app. Long-term, he says the hope is to reenvision the scale as a “longevity station” that measures overall health — not just weight.\n\nAnother hurdle is regulatory oversight. For the Body Scan 2, two features will require FDA clearance: hypertension risk notifications and the six-lead EKG for atrial fibrillation detection. Compared to other health tech companies, Withings has generally opted for FDA clearance when possible, to mixed results. Its ScanWatch smartwatch, for instance, took nearly two years to make it through the FDA clearance process. To launch its U-Scan urinalysis lab, Withings opted to release device as a wellness gadget instead of seeking clearance. The Move ECG smartwatch was announced in 2019, but has yet to hit the US market.\n\nHere, Joussain is more optimistic. He says Withings is pursuing a “new kind of certification” that will allow the company to get its devices on shelves more quickly without sacrificing scientific research. The scale will also be GDPR and HIPAA compliant, and include ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 privacy and security certifications. If all goes according to plan, the Body Scan 2 should be available sometime in Q2 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-04T20:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T02:31:11.699150"}

LG Display and Samsung Display, which typically provide the actual panels used in gaming monitors, are finally lining up the colors of their subpixels in vertical RGB stripes — remember when we used to worry about Pentile OLED displays? — which means, among other improvements, the panels should have easier-to-read text.\n\nYou can see for yourself how Asus and MSI are touting changes to their upcoming monitors with Stripe RGB technology — for Asus, with the ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDN, and ROG Strix OLED XG34WCDMS, and for MSI, with the MEG X and MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36:\n\nBoth LG Display and Samsung Display aim to improve text clarity issues that have plagued ultrawide OLED panels in particular. Samsung Display announced earlier this month that it has started mass production of “the world’s first 34-inch 360Hz QD-OLED panel” with what it calls a “V-Stripe” RGB pixel structure. The V is a bit of a misnomer of how the structure is shaped; it indicates that the subpixels are in a vertical orientation, not in a V. The structure “improves the clarity of text edges, making it ideal for users engaged in text-intensive tasks such as document editing, coding, or content creation,” Samsung Display says.\n\nSamsung Display has already been “supplying the panels to seven global monitor manufacturers including ASUS, MSI, and Gigabyte since December 2025.”\n\nAs for LG Display, it announced last month it would be debuting “the world’s first 27-inch 4K OLED panel for monitors featuring an RGB stripe structure and a 240Hz refresh rate” at CES in Las Vegas. While LG Display was previously known for “WOLED,” where its TVs and gaming monitors typically have an extra white subpixel, or orienting RGB pixels in a triangular pattern, the company says the RGB stripe panels are “optimized for operating systems such as Windows and for font-rendering engines, ensuring excellent text readability and high color accuracy” as well as for providing “optimal performance” in FPS games.\n\nPerhaps confusingly, “RGB stripe” isn’t the only new RGB screen tech from LG Display at CES. It’s also touting “Primary RGB Tandem 2.0,” which it calls “an advanced version of LG Display’s proprietary Primary RGB Tandem technology, which generates light by stacking the three primary colors of light (red, green, and blue) in independent layers.”\n\nAs we discussed last year, Tandem OLED (and Primary RGB Tandem OLED specifically) are about dramatically increasing the brightness of OLED panels, which has been one of their few weaknesses over competing screen tech. Samsung Display’s QD-OLED panels use quantum dots to increase their panel brightness, whereas LG Display is now betting on these stacks. Asus says its PG27UCWM is both an RGB stripe panel and a Tandem OLED panel, though it’s not clear if it uses version 2.0.\n\nFor gaming monitors, LG Display is promising that Primary RGB Tandem 2.0 will enable “monitor displays that achieve a peak brightness of up to 1,500 nits,” and up to 4,500 nits for OLED TVs using the tech. We were impressed by the 1.0 version of Primary RGB Tandem in the LG G5 TV, and we’ll be checking out 2.0 at CES.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-04T20:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T02:31:12.127036"}

She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.\n\nHolding the Z Trifold confirmed my suspicions: it’s a tablet with a phone attached. And after spending an hour folding and unfolding it, I’m pretty much ready to trade in the single-hinge foldable I’ve been carrying for the past couple of weeks.\n\nI used the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold over the holidays as my daily driver and I can probably count on one hand the number of times I unfolded it. Nobody in my family even realized that it unfolded for at least the first 24 hours when I used it on a trip back home. On a different kind of trip, with different circumstances, I probably would have unfolded it more. But after spending some time with the Trifold, I’m starting to wonder if it’s another hinge I needed.\n\nYou know the deal with the Trifold: it’s out in Korea but not officially on sale in the US yet. It has two hinges that close inward, unlike Huawei’s dual folding phone. It’ll be available in the US sometime in the first quarter of this year. The price isn’t known yet but I think we can safely say it will land roughly at “hella expensive,” given that the single-hinged Z Fold 7 costs $2000. But if it lives up to the promise I saw a glimpse of at my pre-CES demo, there might be a fair number of people interested in paying that price.\n\nThe Trifold is surprisingly springy. I took it off a stand where it was propped up and not all the way open; it flipped itself into the fully open position in my hands. When you fold it back up, you’ll want to put the left panel down first since the camera bump is on the other side. If you try it in the reverse order, you’ll get a strong haptic buzz and a stern notification on the inner screen scolding you to do it the other way.\n\nIt’s a thick device all folded up… …but it’s shockingly thin fully unfolded. The back panel picks up fingerprints right quick. There’s a serious wobble if you try to use it folded up on a table.\n\nClosed up, the Trifold has early Galaxy Z Fold vibes about it. The cover screen is a little more long and narrow than a traditional phone screen. It fit into the roomy pocket of my slacks but I wager it would look pretty ridiculous in the side pocket of some yoga pants. I tried using the outer screen, I really did, but the urge to unfold this phone is strong.\n\nI’m not one for tablets usually and I’ve never really been interested in using a Bluetooth keyboard with a phone, but the Trifold begs to be decked out with accessories. I want to prop it up and use a neat little keyboard with it. Maybe even a mouse! If I’d had access to all that over the holidays, maybe I wouldn’t have had to lug my work computer through three airports while wrangling a toddler. I certainly would have unfolded my folding phone before the end of the first day.\n\nJust look at it.\n\nThe thing that makes the Trifold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the Trifold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.\n\nWhen Samsung’s smartphone product head Blake Gaiser told me that there’s a specific version of Adobe Lightroom for the Trifold, it all started clicking. If there’s a grey area somewhere between a tablet, a smartphone, and a computer, then that’s where you’ll find the Trifold. And you’ll find me too, probably, just folding and unfolding it, watching it take shape into something new.\n\nPhotography by Allison Johnson / The Verge", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-04T23:02:40-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T04:10:41.567169"}

Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers.\n\nMono has raised about $17.5 million from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed all its investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers realizing returns of up to 20x. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement.\n\nFounded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity.\n\nThe company addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness.\n\nAccording to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments. Customers include Visa-backed Moniepoint and GIC-backed PalmPay.\n\nFor Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nFlutterwave CEO Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.”\n\nHassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives. That transition depends on both substantial data infrastructure and regulatory confidence, particularly in markets like Nigeria, where open banking frameworks are still evolving.\n\n“If the economy is going to be credit-driven, you need deep data intelligence to know how people earn and spend,” Hassan said. “But at the same time, for open banking to really work, regulators need to be confident that customer funds are safe.”\n\nAgainst that backdrop, joining Flutterwave positions Mono to scale quickly once regulatory barriers fall. Flutterwave already operates across dozens of African markets, with local licenses, enterprise customers, and compliance teams in place.\n\n“This allows us to expand what’s possible for businesses operating across African markets while staying grounded in security, compliance, and local relevance,” Agboola said.\n\nThe transaction mirrors earlier consolidation attempts in global fintech infrastructure, including Visa’s failed acquisition of Plaid in 2020, which was blocked by U.S. regulators. Hassan cited that deal as evidence that combining data infrastructure with payment rails can unlock scale.\n\nBoth Y Combinator-backed companies count Tiger Global (which was the lead investor in Flutterwave’s Series C and Mono’s Series A) among their backers. Hassan said, however, that the firm did not facilitate the transaction. Instead, the deal grew out of a longstanding working relationship between the two companies, which had partnered on several bank payment products over the years.\n\nThat collaboration played out against an open banking landscape that has changed significantly over the past five years.\n\nWhen Mono launched, it faced competition from companies such as Base10 Partners-backed Okra and Ribbit Capital-backed Stitch. Since then, Mono has emerged as a leading player in the space, following Okra’s shutdown and Stitch’s pivot toward a deeper payments ecosystem play that has allowed it to raise significantly more capital.\n\nAddressing Mono’s financial position ahead of the acquisition, Hassan said the company, which, according to Pitchbook, raised $15 million in Series A at a $50 million post-money valuation in 2021, was not forced into a sale to Flutterwave and is on track toward profitability this year. With significant cash reserves, he added, raising another round would have introduced new valuation and growth expectations in a tough funding environment.\n\nStill, beyond the two companies involved, the transaction — similar to the consolidation between South African fintechs Lesaka and Adumo — signals a broader inflection point for African fintech, where startups that once aspired to become standalone giants may increasingly find better outcomes by integrating into scaled platforms.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 08:55:28 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:39:05.081320"}

Then came eSIM.", "content": "SIM cards, the small slips of plastic that have held your mobile subscriber information since time immemorial, are on the verge of extinction. In an effort to save space for other components, device makers are finally dropping the SIM slot, and Google is the latest to move to embedded SIMs with the Pixel 10 series.\n\nAfter long avoiding eSIM, I had no choice but to take the plunge when the time came to review Google’s new phones. And boy, do I regret it.\n\nThe Journey to eSIM\n\nSIM cards have existed in some form since the 1990s. Back then, they were credit-card-sized chunks of plastic that occupied a lot of space inside the clunky phones of the era. They slimmed down over time, going through the miniSIM, microSIM, and finally nanoSIM eras. A modern nanoSIM is about the size of your pinky nail, but space is at a premium inside smartphones. So now there’s eSIM.\n\nThe eSIM standard was introduced in 2016, slowly gaining support as a secondary option in smartphones. Rather than holding your phone number on a removable card, an eSIM is a programmable, nonremovable component soldered to the circuit board. This allows you to store multiple SIMs and swap between them in software, and no one can swipe your SIM card from the phone. They also take up half as much space compared to a removable card, which is why OEMs have begun dropping the physical slot.\n\nApple was the first major smartphone maker to force the use of eSIM with the release of the iPhone 14, and it makes use of that space. The international iPhone 17 with a SIM card slot has a smaller battery than the eSIM-only version, but the difference is only about 8 percent. Google didn’t make the jump until this year with the Pixel 10 series—the US models are eSIM-only, but they unfortunately don’t have more of anything compared to the international versions.\n\nIn advance of the shift, Android got system-level support for downloading and transferring eSIMs. But whatever can go wrong will go wrong, and it’s extremely annoying when eSIM goes wrong.\n\nPlease Hold for Support\n\nThere have been times when I swapped between phones on an almost daily basis—such was the nature of reviewing phones back when there were a dozen of them coming out every month. Never once in all those countless device swaps did I have a problem with my SIM card. As such, I managed to avoid contacting carrier support for years at a time.\n\nIn the three months since Google forced me to give up my physical SIM card, I’ve needed to move my eSIM only occasionally. Still, my phone number has ended up stuck in limbo on two occasions. Android’s built-in tools work better than they used to, and I can’t say what is responsible for the eSIM corruption. However, carriers bear the responsibility for how annoying this is to fix.\n\nThe first time, I was logged in to the mobile app for my carrier (T-Mobile). After a few minutes of back-and-forth with support, I was able to use the app to authenticate and get a new eSIM pushed to the phone. It was annoying but relatively painless. The second time a SIM transfer went sideways, I was not logged in to the app, and that was a problem.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T10:38:33.316193"}

But Zhao and his colleagues at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity have envisioned a new application.\n\nThey believe Crispr could be tailored to create a next-generation treatment for influenza, whether that’s the seasonal strains which plague both the northern and southern hemispheres on an annual basis, or the worrisome new variants in birds and other wildlife that might trigger the next pandemic.\n\nCrispr can edit the genetic code—the biological instruction book that makes life possible—within the cells of every living being. That means it can take different forms. The best-known version is mediated by the Cas9 enzyme; this can fix errors or mutations within genes by cutting strands of DNA. But virologists like Zhao are more interested in Cas9’s less famous cousin, the Cas13 enzyme, which can do the same to RNA. In human cells, RNA molecules carry instructions from DNA to make proteins, but the genetic code of influenza viruses is composed entirely of RNA strands—a vulnerability that Cas13 can exploit.\n\n“Cas13 can target these RNA viruses and inactivate them,” Zhao explained.\n\nHuman cells do not naturally make either Cas9 or Cas13; both of these enzymes are found in the immune systems of bacteria and microscopic organisms called archaea., where Cas13 enables them to disable invading viruses called phages. Zhao and a wider team of scientists are devising an innovative system to confer the same benefits to humans.\n\nInitially pioneered in the lab as a novel Covid antiviral, their idea is to develop a nasal spray or an injection that uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver molecular instructions to flu-infected cells in the respiratory tract. It’s a two-stage process. The first molecule would be an mRNA that instructs the cells to make Cas13, with the second being a so-called guide RNA that directs Cas13 to a specific part of the influenza virus’s RNA code.\n\n“Cas13 then cuts the viral RNA, disrupting the virus’s ability to replicate and effectively stopping the infection at the genetic level,” says Sharon Lewin, an infectious diseases physician at the Peter Doherty Institute who is leading the project.\n\nWhile the main aim would be to use the technology as a way of curbing short-term infections, Zhao also envisions the spray being used to prevent infections, for example during a particularly virulent flu season. “You’d basically be preparing the cells in your respiratory tract to produce this Cas13, as a first layer of defense,” he says. “It’s like the army—you’d have those soldiers armed and ready to meet their enemy.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T10:38:33.503535"}

But once they do, Kodiak could bring its tech to more trucks, faster.", "content": "Self-driving trucks company Kodiak AI announced on Monday it is working with global automotive supplier Bosch to develop a system of hardware and software that can give standard big rigs autonomous driving capabilities.\n\nThe collaboration was announced at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it could help Kodiak bring its self-driving tech to more trucks, faster.\n\nKodiak, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, has already developed and designed a self-driving system with redundant systems for braking, steering, sensors, and computers. In January 2025, Kodiak’s self-driving trucks began making driverless deliveries for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico.\n\nKodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas.\n\nNow, the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses.\n\nBosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette.\n\n“We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

A heap of smart glasses will be announced at CES this year. Based on the emails already flowing into my inbox, these glasses will have just about anything you’d want—voice-activated chatbot search, sharp displays, instant language translation.

{"title": "9 Best Cat Water Fountains, WIRED-Tested and Reviewed (2025)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-cat-water-fountains/", "summary": "Ensuring your cat is drinking enough water is one of the best ways to keep your pet healthy. We tested nearly two dozen models to find the best water fountains for most cats.", "content": "Compare Our Picks\n\nOthers We Tested\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPetlibro Capsule Fountain for $37: This Petlibro fountain is a solid, inexpensive choice. It's made from BPA-free plastic, has a five-layer filtration system and a stainless steel top reservoir, there's a transparent water tank for easier monitoring, and it comes in a bunch of cute colors. The spout is tall and has a continuous flow, making it ideal for cats who love to drink from faucets. However, it's not connected to an app, so you'll have to monitor water levels and set manual reminders for filter replacement and cleaning. The plastic is also harder to clean, and it has a wired pump, which makes cleaning trickier (water and electricity are never an ideal combo). It's a solid model that's worked effectively, but there are better options out there at this price point.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPetkit Eversweet Max for $80: This techy automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered (lasting up to 83 days), and the drinking bowl is made of stainless steel, but the reservoir is plastic. Because of the shape of the basin with the chunky battery and reservoir bowl, it’s a little awkward to clean. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed. The app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you last added water. However, it doesn’t monitor or show you how much water is left in the basin; you have to check manually. The design also made it a bit difficult to clean and refill easily.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nEnabot Rola Smart Pet Water Fountain for $46: This automatic fountain is cordless and runs on a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 60 days (although it can stay plugged in too). It has a wireless pump that uses magnetic induction—this pump was one of the easiest and most hassle-free to clean of all I tested. The fountain has a stainless steel top that holds a decent amount of water even when not running. However, the tank is plastic—I’m wary of plastic because of its propensity to harbor bacteria (plus it doesn't keep water as cold). The app gives reminders of when the water’s low, the fountain needs cleaning, or the filter needs replacing, plus it automatically stops dispensing water and sends you a reminder to refill via its app. It also logs the number of times your pet drank and for how long, monitoring hydration patterns over time. A complaint I had is that this fountain wouldn’t stay on Continuous stream mode, even when plugged in, instead automatically switching to the Sensing stream.\n\nHomerunpet Wireless Pet Fountain for $60: This cordless fountain can be used as a traditional fountain plugged in on its base, or can be detached and moved around the house with 30 days of battery life. I don't love that this fountain is all plastic, but it's easy to see water levels from the outside, the top and filter layers are super easy to remove, clean, and replace, and the wireless (basically silent) pump makes it a whole lot easier to clean. Plastic doesn't keep the water as cold or clean as stainless steel, so you'll have to clean it a lot more often. The fountain only begins bubbling when a cat (or human) approaches to save battery power, and there's no option to control the flow (and no connected app). I like the wireless pump, but I'm really over plastic at this point.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nWonder Creature Cat Fountain for $19: My two cats have cycled through several water fountains over the past few years, but this no-nonsense version has been a stalwart. The inside is lit by a blue LED (bright enough to glow in the dark), and a clear viewing window on the side makes it easy to monitor the water level from afar. I also like the dishwasher-safe metal bowl and the fact you can remove parts of the white-and-yellow flower to create a fountain configuration your cat likes (waterfall, low bubble-up, tall bubble-up). The only major downsides are the fact it requires very frequent cleaning and filter changes due to the plastic body, and that there is no reservoir to hold water in case of power outage or pump malfunction. When I went on vacation, I had to swap it out for an old-school gravity dispenser. —Kat Merck\n\nHappy & Polly Gothic Cat Drinking Fountain for $66: If you prefer gothic decor to neutral blandness, this ghostly ceramic cat fountain from Happy & Polly may tempt you to bite. The water bubbles up out of the top of the ghost and pools on the ceramic top. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets loud when the water is running low, and I worry about the motor burning out, as the 1.5-liter capacity can run dry fast. While the ceramic finish is easy to clean, it is fiddly to take apart. You will want to clean it once a week to prevent it from becoming slimy, and you must change the filter once a month. —Simon Hill\n\nPetkit Eversweet Solo 2 for $45: I love three key features of this fountain: The bowl sits on top of a wireless charging base, so you don’t have to fiddle with cables, it is super easy to clean, and it's very quiet at around 25 decibels. A flashing light warns you when the water is running low, and you can check when the filter needs to be changed in the app. There’s an optional smart mode that pumps intermittently and a night mode to turn the light off. Pleasingly, all three of our cats drink from this fountain, though that does mean I have to refill it often, as it only holds 2 liters. —Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nOneisall Stainless Steel Pet Fountain for $50: This drinking fountain is about as simple as they come. As it's designed for cats or small dogs, it has a large bowl, but some cats will prefer that. I love the mostly stainless steel construction, as it's easy to keep clean and less prone to dirt and bacteria buildup. You can even stick parts into the dishwasher to clean. This fountain can also hold up to 7 liters of water, so you don’t have to refill as often. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets louder when the water is running low (a red light warns you when it needs a refill). You should clean once a week and rinse the filter. The filter packs are relatively affordable, and you need to swap them once a month. —Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPetlipo Cordless Cat Water Fountain for $45: This all-plastic pet fountain sits on a dock for easier tank cleaning and is rechargeable for up to 60 days of cordless power. It has a wire-free pump, a large 2.6-liter capacity, and three customizable water flow modes (induction, timer, and continuous flow). The heavy-duty filter is encased in a plastic cage and only needs to be replaced every four to five weeks. I had no issues while using this fountain, but at nearly $50, it's egregiously expensive for being made out of cheap (and bacteria-harboring) plastic. Although it's a solid fountain, I'd spend less and grab a stainless steel model.\n\nNot Recommended\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPetcube Ceramic Pet Water Fountain for $90: I really wanted to love this fountain; although its basin is plastic, it had a ceramic top, which is more hygienic than plastic (and I had never tested a ceramic model before), and the brand makes some of my favorite pet cameras. However, setup was a bit confusing; it took a long time to get the base charged to power the fountain's water flow; and the sensor to start the water flow is only triggered from one side, making placement awkward. After a few days, it would only run while plugged in. Soon, its stream was barely strong enough to reach the top, and after just over a week, it stopped working altogether. Also, it's overly expensive for what it is.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nCat Mate 3-Level Pet Fountain for $28: This tall automatic Cat Mate fountain sets itself apart with three tiers for cats who like to drink at every level. Cleaning the motor requires disassembly using tools and extended soaking. Because of the long distance the water has to travel, evaporation causes the water to need to be refilled about every other day. Plastic also harbors bacteria, and previous plastic models I’ve owned have had mold issues. The basin is quite large and sits flat. Because of this, some debris would sit in the bottom and front of the large basin rather than moving back to the filter system behind. The plastic material and lack of ergonomic gravity design caused this fountain to be dirtier than others.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nWhisker City Free Fall Cat Fountain for $40: This huge fountain is better suited for dogs, with its 150-fluid-ounce bowl and waterfall design. Although the basin has a small splash pad to help offset the waterfall noise, this was one of the loudest fountains I tested. The evaporation from the waterfall-like system also caused me to refill it every other day. Because of the structure of the fountain, my cats had to bend their head at an awkward angle. They tended to avoid drinking from the basin because of that, and their heads got slightly wet from the splatter of the waterfall. The basin is also not angled, so crumbs and debris sit at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPetkit EverSweet Solo SE for $26: This very simple, straightforward fountain has a square-shaped body, is translucent to easily see water levels from he outside, and has a nearly silent 25-decibel cordless pump to circulate water from the basin to the top level, where 2 ounces of water is always available for drinking, even in case of power failure. The basin sits on a base and all parts easily detach, making it easier to clean. This fountain doesn’t have multiple modes or an associated app—you’ll have to check water levels manually. I noticed this fountain didn't keep water as cold as some of the others, and because of the design of the top, debris often pooled in the dipped areas, which required more frequent cleaning.\n\nHow We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I used each of these for a week as my cats’ main source of water. As mentioned, I noted the ease of setting up, evaluated parts and filters, and generally compared the various types of water fountains—spigot, bubbling, or waterfall. Some flows were continuous and some were intermittent (my cats didn’t prefer intermittent). Cats may also be intrigued and want to play with the machine rather than drink, so be sure to give them time and keep another water source around until they are fully adjusted to the new gadget. Why a Fountain? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Cats sometimes struggle to consume enough water, which can lead to potentially lethal UTIs and blockages in male cats especially. This is one of the reasons vets are moving more toward encouraging owners to give their cat at least a partially wet food diet, as this helps them consume more moisture, especially since cats don’t naturally consume as much water as dogs. Unlike dogs, cats are generally quite particular in their likes and dislikes, and cats can see stagnant water as potentially harmful. (If the cat was in the wild, stagnant water has more potential for harmful bacteria). Cats are more drawn to moving water in nature, and these fountains help encourage them to drink more by emulating what they’re naturally drawn to. While automatic water fountains are better for your cats' overall water consumption, they do require a bit more work and money. Rather than refilling a bowl, these take a little more elbow grease—but it’s worth it for your cat’s health. Along with routine refilling and cleaning, you’ll need to disassemble the fountain to clean all parts, including using a brush for the bowl and tubes. You may also have to disassemble the motor to deep-clean because of mineral buildup. These also have different types of filtration cartridges in specific shapes for the brand’s fountains, which require you to buy and change out filters, usually monthly but sometimes more often. What I Look For AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Let’s be honest, a lot of these fountains are pretty much the same. I looked especially for the overall design—I am a fiend for stainless steel because of the potential of porous plastic harboring harmful bacteria. I also favor a wide reservoir without high sides to help reduce the chance for whisker fatigue. I prefer fountains that have a small basin reservoir of water available at all times, in case of low water levels or power failure. I took into account ease of setting up, refilling, and cleaning, as well as overall design. And of course, there were some that my cats took to straight away, and some they didn’t seem to favor as much. After prolonged testing, I now look for these three things and encourage you too as well: a cordless pump for easier (and safer) cleaning, constructed from stainless steel so it's more hygienic, and a window to monitor water levels (especially if it's not connected to an app).\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

You couldn’t always trust the words coming out of his mouth, Schmitz said, because sometimes they weren’t really his words—or his mouth. Schmitz had become the target of AI-generated impersonation scams.\n\n“You’re being watched by a demonic human,” said the fake Schmitz in one video that the real Schmitz, wearing an L.L. Bean jacket over his clerical suit, included in his public service announcement as an example. “You must act quickly, because the spots for sending prayers are already running out,” said another fake Schmitz with a looming hourglass behind him. “And the next trip will only take place in four months.” The fake Schmitz sounded ever-so-slightly robotic as he urged viewers to click a link and secure their blessing before it was too late.\n\n“I can look at them and say ‘That’s ridiculous, I would never say that,’” the real Schmitz, who is based in Duluth, Minnesota, said in his callout video. “But people can’t necessarily tell. That’s a problem. That’s, like, a really big problem.”\n\nOn the real video of Schmitz, some of the top comments from his followers said they had seen other prominent Catholic figures impersonated through AI videos, including the pope. According to cybersecurity expert Rachel Tobac, who is the CEO of SocialProof Security, that’s because pastors have become extremely popular subjects of AI scams and other deceptive media.\n\n“If you’re on TikTok or Reels, they’ve probably come across your For You page,” Tobac says. “This is somebody who looks to be a priest, who’s wearing all of the garments, who’s standing up on a pulpit or a stage or whatever you’d call it, and they seem to be speaking to their congregation in a very enthusiastic way.”\n\nPastors and ministers in Birmingham, Alabama, Freeport, New York, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, have warned their followers about AI scams impersonating them in the form of DMs, calls, and deepfakes. Alan Beauchamp, a pastor in the Ozarks, said his Facebook account was hacked, with the hacker posting a fake, possibly AI-generated certificate for cryptocurrency trading with Beauchamp’s name on it and a caption urging his congregants to join him. A megachurch in the Philippines received reports of deepfakes featuring its pastors. An evangelical church in Nebraska issued an AI “scammer alert” on Facebook, and one churchgoer in the comments posted a screenshot of texts purported to be from one of their pastors.\n\nIt doesn’t help that a lot of the pastors and ministers who have grown large online followings often actually are soliciting donations and selling things, just not the same things that their AI impersonators are. With the help of social media, religious authority figures have been able to reach believers far beyond their neighborhoods, but the proliferation of content featuring their likenesses and voices has also provided the perfect opportunity for scammers wielding generative AI tools.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T11:46:54.294695"}

About 70 percent of the dialog was spoken in Japanese, and many of the principal cast members were actors not yet widely known in the United States.\n\nThe fact that the show nevertheless held viewers’ interest pleased Marks. “I think the viewers enjoyed the experience of discovering a culture they did not understand through the story,\" he says. “This is because the algorithm only presents choices that are similar to past choices, so choices that venture into an unknown culture are unlikely to be recommended in the first place.”\n\nThe success of Shogun showed that the desire for such “discovery” certainly existed.\n\nCondou worked on the story with Marks (who is also her husband) both together and separately. “We worked on the script in different rooms, going back and forth from room to room.

{"title": "Magnesium Supplements Crash Course (2026): Benefits and Side Effects", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-magnesium-supplements-good-for/", "summary": "Promises of better sleep—and better poops—are driving the magnesium supplements craze.", "content": "“It’s really overlooked that magnesium can help with menstrual cycle irregularity in terms of making sure that you’re not having severe cramping,” says Anderson-Haynes, who adds it may also benefit women in perimenopause and menopause. Clinically, it may be part of the treatment for pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and eclampsia.\n\nCan You Take Too Much?\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance is 320 milligrams per day for women and 420 milligrams per day for men. These are amounts most people can reach with a balanced diet; healthy kidneys regulate magnesium levels, excreting excess when magnesium intake is high and conserving it when it’s low.\n\nDaily supplements under 350 milligrams are generally considered safe for healthy adults. “If you take too much magnesium, you’ll probably get diarrhea, because it loosens the bowels,” Anderson-Haynes says. Other side effects include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and, at very high levels of magnesium (usually from overusing laxatives or antacids), low blood pressure, muscle cramps, breathing problems, and, in rare cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease are at the highest risk of toxicity.\n\nShould You Supplement?\n\nFor most healthy U.S. adults, magnesium supplements aren’t essential. If you struggle with migraines, insomnia, or other conditions where research suggests health benefits, they may be worth trying—but first talk to a health care professional.\n\nOtherwise, focus on magnesium-rich foods. These include but are not limited to: legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), leafy greens (artichokes, kale, spinach), whole grains (oats, barley, quinoa), nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts), fruit (bananas, avocado, dried apricots), and soy products (tofu, soy milk, edamame). Dark chocolate is also a good source of magnesium; 100 grams of 70-85 percent of cacao solids contain 228 milligrams of magnesium, which is more than half of the amount of magnesium recommended for daily intake.\n\nIf you do decide to take any dietary supplements, “look for a seal or certification that says GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or NSF,” says Anderson-Haynes, stressing the importance of third-party tests and verifications, considering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't regulate dietary supplements in the US.\n\nOur Favorite Magnesium Supplements\n\nPure Encapsulations was recommended to me by my doctor, and it seems to be the company that health care professionals trust the most. I prefer capsules over powders when it comes to magnesium glycinate because I'm taking these right before bed and usually can't stomach a liquid concoction. Each capsule contains 120 milligrams, and you can take one to four capsules a day depending on what your doctor recommends.\n\nWhile magnesium glycinate is often taken for sleep and a better mood, it also supports heart health, cellular energy production, and bone structure. It's also less likely to have a laxative effect if you're usually sensitive to magnesium supplements. Pure Encapsulations sells several forms of magnesium, in capsule, powder, and liquid form.\n\nThorne (NSF Certified for Sport) is one of the brands we trust the most when it comes to dietary supplements, mostly because they rigorously test their products for potency, purity, and label accuracy through every step of the process. They screen raw materials for contaminants in their in-house laboratories. They check the supplements, including the bottles and labels, for defects. Before hitting the shelves, they ensure that no microbiological contamination has occurred during the manufacturing process. Lastly, products undergo stability testing to confirm that they will meet their label claims up to the expiration date.\n\nThorne also offers travel packs, capsules, multivitamins that contain magnesium, and other forms of magnesium, including Magnesium CitraMate, which is a blend of magnesium citrate and di-magnesium malate.\n\nCourtesy of Buoy Buoy Rainforest Activated Magnesium $88 Buoy\n\nMany health care providers have drilled into me that you should get nutrients, like magnesium, from food as opposed to supplements. Like most people, I have trouble getting enough leafy greens and seeds in my diet. Buoy’s Rainforest Activated Magnesium does the job (and adds a minty undertone to my morning smoothies). This magnesium powder is formulated with plants sourced from the Australian rainforest, including anise myrtle, shiitake mushrooms, and pumpkin seed meal. Theoretically, these aid in better absorption and make the supplement more metabolically useful. I’m still following the doctor’s orders of using food sources, and I sleep more deeply when regularly using it. —Julia Forbes\n\nMeet the Experts\n\nSue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, MS, RDN, CDCES, is a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and founder of 360Girls&Women.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

While it has recovered six computers, Luminar is still seeking Russell’s company-issued phone and a digital copy of his personal phone.\n\nLuminar’s lawyers also wrote in the filing that Russell and his own personal employees repeatedly misled legal representatives about the founder’s location over the holidays. They’re asking the court for permission to instead serve Russell by mail or email. A lawyer for Luminar declined to comment further.\n\nIn emails attached to the filing, Russell claimed he was being cooperative and has been trying to get assurances from Luminar that any personal data from his devices will be protected.\n\n“The company declined, so we will follow the court-established process for data handling protections instead,” Leonard Shulman, an attorney for Russell, told TechCrunch in a statement.\n\nThe emergency filing is one of the first major twists in a fast-moving bankruptcy case that involves Luminar trying to sell the two main parts of its business. The company is seeking court approval of an already-reached agreement to sell its semiconductor subsidiary to a company called Quantum Computing, Inc., and has established a January 9 deadline for bids on its lidar division.\n\nRussell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy Luminar before the Chapter 11 filing and has expressed plans to make a bid in the bankruptcy process. “As it relates to Luminar, our focus remains on what matters: Russell AI Labs’ bid to rebuild the company and bring value to its stakeholders,” Shulman said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nLawyers for Luminar said in the filing that it began hunting for information from Russell in May, just after he abruptly resigned following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” performed by the board’s audit committee. The company was evaluating whether it may have potential legal claims against him “relating to the Audit Committee inquiry and personal loans taken by Mr. Russell,” according to the filing. But Luminar said those efforts were unsuccessful and Russell was not cooperative.\n\nOn November 12, Luminar’s board of directors established a Special Investigation Committee and hired law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges to further investigate “certain acts, omissions, transactions and potential claims and causes of action involving or related to certain current and former directors and officers of Luminar.”\n\nOne month later, just before the bankruptcy, lawyers for Weil contacted the law firm of McDermott Will & Schulte, which had previously represented Russell. The Weil lawyers asked about collecting Russell’s Luminar-provided laptop and desktop computers, along with his company-issued phone and a digital copy (or “image”) of his personal phone.\n\nThe lawyers from Weil spent a week trying to confirm whether McDermott would represent Russell in the matter of the Special Investigation Committee, only to find out on December 19 that it would not. The Weil lawyers tried contacting Russell directly instead.\n\nRussell responded for the first time on Christmas Eve, according to the filing. He eventually authorized McDermott to turn over the computers (which the firm had kept in its possession since his resignation), but the founder repeatedly asked for guarantees that Luminar’s lawyers would not search through personal data on his phones, emails attached to the emergency filing show.\n\n“I have offered direct cooperation as well as prompt action, even through the holidays – but if this singular basic protection cannot be confirmed, I am advised further deliberations on this matter will not be productive,” Russell wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve.\n\nRepresentatives for Luminar arranged to have a forensic examiner appear at Russell’s mansion in Florida on New Year’s Day. But the technician was turned away by Russell’s security team, which a lawyer for Luminar called “unacceptable.”\n\nRussell claimed the technician was sent to his home “unannounced” on the holiday morning “when I was asleep,” and reiterated his desire to protect the privacy of his personal data. A lawyer for Luminar responded that they had “repeatedly confirmed that we have no intention of looking at any documents beyond those that are Luminar-related.” Russell replied on January 2 that “[a]ny characterization that I have been uncooperative is wholly inaccurate” and accused the lawyers of “word gymnastics.”\n\nLuminar’s lawyers tried instead to subpoena this information from Russell but claim their process servers were similarly turned away by his security team. They also claim those security team members lied about Russell’s presence at his Florida residence.\n\n“Can we try to serve Austin again today? We’re going to need someone dogged. He is going to evade service as long as possible,” one of the Weil lawyers wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. “In fact, he was home when your person tried last time and the guard simply lied for him.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:10:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T12:59:09.193120"}

The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.”\n\nThe sensor will start shipping until 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects the Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles.\n\nTeradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively-unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks.\n\nIt’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers.\n\nTeradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, as the automakers backed away from the tech.\n\nThose deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025.\n\nOther U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (acquired and merged with rival Velodyne after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.\n\nLidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable.\n\nTeradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity.\n\n“Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T12:59:09.821423"}

We began doing this in 2022 and have since put out a top-10 list every year (see 2023 and 2024). Our intent, as always, is to spark debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company. It’s a demanding business, both technically and financially. We respect the grit and hustle because we know just how hard this stuff is.\n\nPlease also note that this is a subjective list, although hard metrics such as total launches, tonnage to orbit, success rate, and more were all important factors in the decision. And finally, our focus remains on what each company accomplished in 2025, not on what they might do in the future.\n\n1. SpaceX (no change from 2024)\n\nIt was not difficult to select the first-place company on this list. As it has every year in our rankings, SpaceX holds the top spot. As of the first week of December, SpaceX has launched 165 rockets in 2025, the vast majority of which were used Falcon 9 boosters. The company has put more than 1 million tons of cargo into orbit and remains NASA’s essential contractor for keeping the International Space Station operating with a steady rotation of crew and consumables.\n\nRegarding the larger Starship vehicle, this was a frustrating year for SpaceX. The first three launches of the massive rocket (in January, March, and May) resulted in a failure of the Starship upper stage. The last two flights of the year (in August and October) were much more successful, setting the stage for the company to move to its Block 3 version of the vehicle.

The new Sense Pro and Lite use JBL’s OpenSound technology, support Dual Connect and Fast Pair, have an adjustable ear hook for better comfort, and allow for touch control customization through the JBL app. We first heard about the earbuds in August 2025, but at the time there wasn’t any indication of when they’d make it to the US.\n\nWhat sets the Sense Pro apart are 16.2mm drivers, support for spatial sound, hi-res audio with adaptive bass boost, and JBL Voice Pickup Sensor technology (which uses bone vibrations to hone in on your voice) and the use of an AI-trained algorithm for improved call quality. The Pro support Bluetooth 6.0, have up to 38 hours of playtime (eight with the buds and an additional 30 with the case). They can be charged wirelessly, and a short charge of 10 minutes will get four hours of playback. JBL’s Personi-Fi 3.0, found in its high-end earbuds like the Tour Pro 3, allow you to fine-tune your equalization preference by going through an in-app hearing test. Available colors include only black and gray.\n\nThe Sense Lite are lighter on features (no spatial sound, hi-res support, wireless charging, Voice Pickup Sensor tech, or Personi-Fi), but still offer up to 32 hours of playtime (24 hours with the case instead of 30 on the Pro), a quick charge of 10 minutes gets three hours of playback, they use Bluetooth 5.4, and the buds are rated IP54.

They’ll be offered in four translucent color options: copper, blue, purple, and white.\n\nThe OpenSound technology JBL developed for its open-ear earbuds uses air conduction — a fancy way to describe how sound moving through air always works — which directs the sound into your ear while using phase cancellation to reduce dispersion. And since the buds don’t seal in your ears, you’re still able to hear the world around you without the need for a transparency mode.\n\nAll of the earbuds will be available starting in March 2026.

They use OpenSound technology (the same found in the JBL Sense product line) with a flexible earhook design to keep them secure through a workout while still allowing you to hear your surroundings. Positioning of the 18x11mm driver minimizes sound leakage as you listen to music or take phone calls, and each bud uses two beam-forming microphones for vocal clarity. The earbuds are IP68 rated, use Bluetooth 5.3, and support multipoint connection, Google Fast Pair, Google Finder, and Google Audio Switch. They’ll last for up to eight hours on a charge, with another 24 hours from the case, and a quick charge of 10 minutes will get you three hours of listening time. The Endurance Zone will be available in black with gray and white and will cost $179.95.\n\nThe Endurance Peak 4 are the first of the Peak line to incorporate adaptive noise canceling with a sealed design and smart ambient, which allows for situational awareness when you’re outside biking or running. They’re also the only of the new earbuds to support spatial sound from their 10mm drivers.

But there’s still more to come, so you can check back here every day, or catch up on all of The Verge’s CES 2026 coverage here.\n\nPhoto: Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nFirst announced last month, The Verge’s Allison Johnson finally got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Z TriFold that uses a pair of inward-folding hinges to expand from a chunky phone to a large tablet. For now it’s only available in Korea, but the Z TriFold is expected to be available in the US sometime in Q1 2026 for what will most likely be a hefty chunk of change. Its biggest selling point, according to Johnson, is the potential of carrying around a laptop replacement in your pocket. “The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.”\n\nImage: GE Appliances\n\nIf you always seem to remember what groceries you need after you get home from the store, GE Appliances’ new package-scanning fridge can help you create a comprehensive shopping list. Launching in April 2026 for $4,899, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant has a scanner on the front you can use to scan empty packages, and you can manually add items to a shopping list using an 8-inch tablet on the door. There’s even a camera inside the fridge you can remotely access through an app to check if you’ve run out of something while you’re shopping.\n\nImage: Clicks\n\nClicks is best known for its smartphone cases that add a physical BlackBerry-style compact keyboard. Its latest creation has that same keyboard, but also a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, a headphone jack, and a 5G data connection, and it runs Android 16. The Clicks Communicator is designed to be an alternative to your daily driver smartphone that you can limit to essential apps to minimize distractions. At $499 it’s priced similarly to the Pixel 9A, but you can reserve one now for a limited time to get a discount.\n\nImage: LG\n\nAs TCL and Hisense have done, LG is looking to usurp the dominance of Samsung’s The Frame in the art TV category. Its new LG Gallery TV leverages the company’s Gallery+ service that launched earlier this year to display everything from art to gaming scenes. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with what is likely a matte coating, but LG describes it as having a “specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience.” It comes with a white frame, and while you can purchase additional wood-colored frames, pricing for the LG Gallery TV hasn’t been announced.\n\nLots of time to think about the robot uprising while folding laundry. Image: LG\n\nLG’s CLOiD is a home robot that can potentially do more than just clean your floors. The robot features a pair of articulated arms with seven degrees of motion mounted to a mobile base with a torso that can tilt and bend. LG says CLOiD can perform household tasks like folding and stacking laundry, putting food in the oven, or fetching something from your fridge. Can it do that faster or more reliably than you can? That remains to be seen, but CLOiD could be even more useful as a mobile smart home hub you can converse with as it follows you around the house.\n\nIMAGE: Samsung\n\nSamsung’s Family Hub smart fridges aren’t new, but the company will soon be introducing a new feature for added convenience: voice-activated door opening and closing. When your hands are full of groceries, or are dirty while you’re whipping up a meal, you’ll be able to ask Bixby to “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and it will open over 90 degrees giving you full access. If your mouth is full of food and you can’t properly articulate what you want, the door can also be opened or closed using a tap of your palm or the back of your hand.\n\nImage: SwitchBot\n\nIf you pulled a Honey, I Shrunk the Kids on the Las Vegas Sphere, you’d end up with something like SwitchBot’s new dome-shaped Obboto RGB desk lamp. It’s wrapped in over 2,900 color-changing LEDs and can display preset animations, animated GIFs, AI-powered “mood animations,” music visualizers, or just the local weather and time if you want to be practical. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet.\n\nImage: Petkit\n\nPetkit’s new automatic pet feeder that can dole out up to seven days of wet food isn’t just about alleviating guilt about leaving your furry friend behind while you travel. The Yumshare Daily Feast uses an NFC tracking system to remove meals that haven’t been eaten in 48 hours and UVC lighting to sanitize the system for delivering fresh ones. What’s potentially even more useful is an AI-powered 1080p night vision camera that tracks when and how much your pet eats to provide insights on their diet and possible health issues. It’s expected to launch in April 2026 and will be sold through pet food companies.\n\nImage: LG\n\nSix years after its first Wallpaper TV debuted in 2017, LG has revived the line with its new LG OLED evo W6. The TV is 9mm thick thanks to its redesigned internal architecture and features a new mount so it can sit completely flush against a wall. Further improving installation is the W6’s use of LG’s Zero Connect Box which wireless sends a video signal from up to 33 feet away. The only physical cable you need to route to the W6 is for power. It will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.\n\nImage: GameSir\n\nGameSir may have already clinched the title for weirdest controller at CES 2026. The company shared more details about its upcoming Swift Drive gamepad that features a small steering wheel in the middle of the controller. The wheel’s connected to a high-precision Hall effect encoder and an equally small direct drive motor that provides force feedback effects while playing racing games and sims. There are additional haptic motors located in the gamepad’s Hall effect triggers to simulate effects like ABS braking, and it’s got RGB lighting effects that can be synced to your game. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed yet.\n\nImage: Yukai Engineering\n\nIt’s not quite as adorable as the furry Mirumi robot that debuted at last year’s CES, but Yukai Engineering’s new Baby FuFu is potentially more practical.

Its new device, the Valet, is maybe its simplest idea ever: it’s a nice-looking tray designed to be the place you drop your keys, sunglasses, and other pocket detritus, and offers a couple of ways to charge whatever needs to be charged. It costs $179.99, and ships in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMost of the Valet tray is just… tray. It’s covered in a soft leather, which comes in several different colors. (You can also customize the outer metal frame to match.) On one side, a raised square acts like a podium for wireless charging up to 15 watts. You can plug in another USB cable to a port on the side, and charge a second device that way — again at 15 watts. The Valet itself plugs in via a 36-watt power supply, and comes with a 1.5-meter cable to do so.\n\nThe charging specs make the Valet’s purpose pretty clear: This is not meant to be your laptop charger, or a charging hub of really any kind. It’s not even as straightforwardly functional as Twelve South’s own HiRise, which can charge three devices at a time. What it is, instead, is an attempt to make charging your most important devices — especially your phone — feel a bit more seamless.\n\nIt’s the everlasting dream of wireless charging, really, to just put your device down wherever and have it full when you pick it up. Aligned on a podium isn’t exactly wherever, but I’ve been using a Valet and I have in fact enjoyed not hunting for cables so much. Mine’s sitting on my desk, but most Valets will likely end up on nightstands and in entryways.\n\nTwelve South is one of a lot of companies, including big names like Ikea, exploring gadgets that look more like home decor than high tech.

The Neo look like a traditional pair of over-ear wireless headphones but feature an extra flexible headband that can be twisted and rolled up around the ear cups to turn them into a compact wireless speaker.\n\nHeadphones that double as speakers aren’t an entirely new idea, but previous offerings either use ear cups that rotate 180 degrees to face outward, or ear cups with an open-back design so that everything you listen to is heard by those around you. The Neo take a different approach. A pair of 40mm drivers on the inside of the ear cups are used in headphone mode so your listening remains private. Switching to speaker mode, either by pressing a button or rolling the Neo up, turns those interior drivers off and activates a second pair of outward-facing 40mm drivers so your music can be shared.\n\nTDM claims impressive battery life of up to 200 hours in headphone mode, but that drops to just over 10 hours in speaker mode while those 40mm drivers are pumping out more sound. The Neo uses a pair of rechargeable 1,500mAh batteries that are user-replaceable, potentially prolonging the life of the headphones. Wireless connectivity is handled through Bluetooth 6 with multipoint and Auracast support, or you can also use a 3.5mm audio cable with older devices. There’s also a microphone for making calls or activating voice assistants including Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant in headphone or speaker mode.\n\nTDM plans to make the Neo headphones available through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launching in January 2026. They’ll be available in black or white color options for $249. That positions them at the higher end of the wireless headphone spectrum, but they’re missing a popular feature typically found at that price point: active noise cancelling.

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings.\n\nThe company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead.\n\nDesigned for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors.\n\nYou could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nGemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required.\n\nBut Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too.\n\nAt CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nGemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments. They can also apply artistic styles to their photos and videos using Gemini AI and turn their memories into cinematic slideshows, says Google.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nHowever, perhaps the most useful feature is one that gives you the power to optimize the TV’s settings using only your voice.\n\nNow, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nGoogle says the new Gemini features will require the Google TV devices to be running Android TV OS 14 or higher, and they will need an internet connection.

Instead of just keeping a set speed, radar-enabled adaptive cruise control allowed the car to react to deceleration by the car ahead, and thus was created the first partially automated car. From there, automakers added a function to keep cars in their lanes, and now we have location-aware, GPS-geofenced vehicles that, as long as the driver is paying attention, will do most of the driving—on the highway at least.\n\nBut the goal for developers of both autonomous and partially automated vehicles is to remove as much of the burden of driving from the human as possible, not just on controlled access highways but at lower speeds, on surface streets. Which is what Mercedes’ latest Drive Assist Pro has been designed to do. And after a recent demo—albeit from the passenger seat—on the streets of downtown San Francisco, it appears to be a very credible effort.\n\nCLA gets it first\n\nThe big, powerful, comfortable S-Class is normally the standard-bearer for the latest and greatest tech Mercedes has cooked up, but not always.

Unfortunately, at-home testing can be cumbersome, involving collecting samples that are then mailed out to labs. That’s what health startup Mira is trying to simplify with its $249 Ultra4 Hormone Monitor.\n\nThe pitch is to make highly accurate, readily available hormone testing for at-home users. The Ultra4 is technically two separate products. The first is the actual Hormone Monitor, which is a standalone, egg-shaped gadget that analyzes test results. The second is the Ultra4 Wand, which is a little stick you pee on that contains the actual test for four reproductive hormones: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (PdG).\n\nBy testing these four hormones simultaneously, Mira CEO and cofounder Sylvia Kang says users can not only track fertility, but also gain insights into conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), perimenopause, menopause, and even metabolic health. The hope is that by regularly testing at home, you can customize treatment for these conditions as well as notice trends based on long-term hormone levels.\n\nThe collapsible pee cup is reusable. You stick the test in for 15 seconds, and the analyzer spits out results in about 16 minutes.\n\n“The goal is to help women to manage their health more proactively,” says Kang, who notes that at-home hormone testing wasn’t really a thing back when she founded Mira in 2018. “I saw so many friends trying to conceive at a late age, and the journey was really challenging. They had no idea what was wrong with them, but the only products they could purchase were ovulation kits or basal body thermometers. Neither has lab-grade accuracy or provides real understanding about what’s going on in your body.”\n\nThat’s since changed. “Hormone balancing” has been a trending wellness topic over the last two years, and while influencers rarely get the facts right, the increased interest in at-home testing speaks to how frustrating treating hormonal conditions can be. Technically, Mira has been around for nearly a decade, and the new Ultra4 kit was soft-launched in late August. The company’s at CES 2026 to say the kit is now more widely available. Mira sent me an analyzer and Ultra4 Wands ahead of the show, and as someone with PCOS – who’s also right in the time frame for perimenopause — I was curious to see what using the device is like.\n\nIn a nutshell, you fill out a detailed survey within the Mira app about what you’re looking to find out (i.e., fertility windows, hormone management, insight into irregular cycles, etc.) Then you pee into an included collapsible silicone cup and stick a test wand in. After about 15 seconds, you then stick the test into the analyzer and wait for 16 minutes to view your results both on-device and in the app. Depending on your goals, the app will generate a customized testing schedule.\n\nThat part was easy enough, though it’s still too early for me to say what insights I’ll learn. Supposedly, a single test can give insights into cycle health and how many eggs you might have in reserve, as well as identify root causes for irregular cycles or hormonal issues. For now, my custom plan told me that I’ll need to test for five consecutive days for two straight cycles to figure out if I’m showing signs of perimenopause. Meaning, this is a device that’s meant to be used over several months to build a hormonal baseline for users. Even so, the app does provide explainers as to what each hormone does for the body and what high or low levels can mean.\n\nA little carrying case for portability.\n\nOne note: Mira isn’t intended to be used as a contraceptive. It’s firmly in the realm of wellness. The gadget itself is FDA-listed as a Class I device — meaning the agency views it as very low-risk and requires less scrutiny compared to features or devices requiring clearance or approval.\n\nKang also says that fertility isn’t the only focus for its users anymore.\n\n“Right now, 40 percent of our users are not trying to conceive. They’re interested in menopause, PCOS, and hormones in general. Specifically, in symptom management,” Kang says. The hope then is to give those users data they can use to better understand how they can improve their health. For example, a user may notice that when a certain hormone spikes, they experience specific symptoms like headaches or nausea. Knowing that specific timing may help someone discuss with their doctor how to approach treatment.\n\nApplying that logic further down the line, Kang says Mira hopes to one day expand to other biological fluids like blood and saliva for hormonal analysis. Eventually, the goal is to move beyond just reproductive health and toward “longevity” or preventive health. For example, Kang notes that early research shows that there may be a link between certain hormones and metabolic health as well.\n\nFor now, cost is the biggest barrier. The Ultra4 Hormone Kit starts at $249, and replacement wand packs cost roughly $99. The analyzer alone costs $149. Even so, this all dovetails with where health tech has been heading. The covid-19 pandemic popularized and increased access to at-home testing. Hormone testing and perimenopause tech were also featured at last year’s CES. Meanwhile, Withings, Oura, and Whoop are all examples of health tech companies who have recently explored blood tests and urine as a means of promoting healthy aging.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T15:35:24.871156"}

Its design isn’t as intuitive to navigate as Google TV, Roku, or Apple TV, and its responsiveness is frustrating. I’ve found it to be the weak link in Amazon’s portfolio for a while now, and the only major drawback to otherwise excellent TVs like the Panasonic Z95B. But after getting a demo of what Amazon has in store, I dare say I’m excited for a new Fire TV OS redesign.\n\nThe new layout is better organized and reminiscent of Google TV (which has been my favorite for a few years now). It’s visually more pleasing to look at, with rounded-corner tiles instead of the harsh rectangles of the current version. And its arrangement looks far more easy to navigate. Instead of in the middle of the screen alongside installed apps, there are tabs across the top of the screen for search, home, and pages separated into movies, TV shows, sports, news, and live content. Those different tabs will aggregate content from across all of your active subscriptions, instead of only by app.\n\nIf you do want to browse through your apps, they now live on their own line. And you’re no longer limited to having only six apps pinned to the homepage. You can now pin up to 20 and change their order to put your most used at the beginning of the list. There’s still sponsored content recommendations that take up a good portion of the screen, but it’s hard to escape that on any streaming OS.\n\nThe sports tab will display live games you can immediately watch from services you’re subscribed to. Image: Amazon\n\nThe Amazon team also redid the coding for the OS for a faster experience, saying that they’ve seen improvements in speed responsiveness of up to 30 percent. With the remote you can hit the menu button to quickly get to games, art, and photos, and Amazon’s Ambient Experience. And a long press on the home button pulls up a shortcut panel to quickly access audio and display settings, check on your connected devices (such as Ring cameras), or other regularly used controls.\n\nAmazon Alexa+ will be fully integrated with the new Fire TV OS, allowing you to search through your content, get updates and stats on your favorite sports teams, adjust your connected smart lights or thermostat, or jump to your favorite scene.\n\nAlongside the OS redesign, the Fire TV mobile app has also gotten some love. Apart from just acting as a backup remote, you can now use the mobile app to browse content, add movies and shows to your watch list, and select titles to play on your TV. The app is also accessible when you’re away from home, so if your friend suggests something while you’re out, you can still easily add it to watch later.\n\nThe new Fire TV UI redesign will launch in February, starting with the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED TVs.

A more affordable Matter-over-Thread option compared to the excellent but expensive Halo Select, the Aura Reach is available now for $189.\n\nAt just under $100 less than the Halo, you are sacrificing built-in Wi-Fi and an integrated door sensor that lets you know if the door is open or closed. The full-replacement deadbolt lock also has a Grade 2 security rating compared to Grade 1 on the Halo line, and a more utilitarian design.\n\nWhile the Aura does work with Apple Home through Matter, it doesn’t support Apple Home Key’s tap-to-unlock, which is available on the Halo Select Plus. That model costs a whopping $360, thanks to the Apple tax.\n\nHowever, the Aura does feature a touchscreen keypad with a built-in backlight that turns on as you approach, thanks to a proximity sensor — a nice touch.\n\nThe Aura also works with Kwikset’s hands-free auto-unlock feature. This uses a combination of Bluetooth and geofencing to unlock as you approach. Plus, you can also unlock it via Bluetooth using Kwikset’s app.\n\nThe lock is powered by four AA batteries that should last up to a year. Image: Kwikset\n\nWhile there’s no Wi-Fi, because the lock works with Matter-over-Thread, you can control it when you’re away from home by connecting it to a Matter platform, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Apple Home. However, you will need a Thread Border Router — which could be an Apple TV or an Echo smart speaker.\n\nKwikset says the Aura also has a new optional Signal Range Boost, which “doubles Matter network performance.” This could be useful if your Thread border router isn’t near your front door.\n\nFinally, you can also just use a traditional key, and it supports Kwikset’s SmartKey Security, which lets you rekey the lock yourself.\n\nThe Aura Reach is ANSI/BHMA Grade 2 certified, available in satin nickel and matte black, and now available for $189 from Amazon, The Home Depot, Lowe’s, and others.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T15:35:25.525724"}

PHOTOGRAPH: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThere are two titanium hinges, and they open up three panels. You can place a full-size app on each of the three panes, use a larger version of split-screen, or expand one app across the vast display. It was easy to configure these setups, and I can totally see myself taking advantage of having three apps open simultaneously. It is still a little unwieldy to hold, but that's not unusual for a 10-inch tablet. The TriFold is very slim in its unfolded state, which helps.\n\nFold it up, and you're looking at a thickness of 12.9 millimeters, which is just a smidge chunkier than the Galaxy Z Fold6 (12.1 mm). The fact that it's roughly the same thickness as a prior generation fold, yet with a dramatically larger screen, is impressive. It makes the bulk a little more palatable. There is a correct way to fold it, and an incorrect way. Thankfully, if you start folding it the wrong way with the right screen in first, the phone violently buzzes, and you'll see an alert on the screen asking to fold in the other screen first. I can still picture someone ignoring this and just carrying on, though.\n\nThe hardware is exquisite, and the specs are top-notch, closer to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra; there's a 200-megapixel main camera on the back, and the phone is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.

The update represents the first major Fire TV release in years from a user experience perspective, the company says, and is accompanied by a refreshed version of the Fire TV app and the arrival of new premium Fire TV televisions with colorful frames.\n\nThe company saw the need for a change to the Fire TV’s look and feel as the amount of streaming content has exploded over the years. Fire TV customers today can access TV and movies via purchases, rentals, and streaming services, but also have apps for viewing short-form content on the TV, access to numerous live TV streams, premium content, podcasts, music, games, and more.\n\nFire TV’s simpler design\n\n“As we brought that content forward, the [user interface] got a little cluttered — a lot of stuff and a lot of rows,” explained Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss in an interview with TechCrunch. “We know the data — there’s a lot of time spent searching,” he added. “We…know that it could just be easier.”\n\nThe new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what’s up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nBefore, you could only pin six apps to the Fire TV’s home screen — a common user complaint. But the update has reduced the app icons’ size, allowing more to be visible on the home screen, and offers you 20 app slots you can scroll through.\n\nAt the top of the screen, navigation has been simplified into obvious categories like Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. A search button is available to the left of the Home tab.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nAcross the new tabs, Fire TV centralizes access to the content you’re already watching, and what’s available across services you’re subscribed to. It also offers you the ability to discover new content, including recommended movies or shows (in rows labeled “For You”), free movies you can stream, lists of the top movies or shows, and other subscription content you may want to try.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nThese pages don’t offer infinite scrolling, but they’re lengthy as they represent the depth of content available on streaming services.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nThe new live TV tab organizes the live content from the services that have live TV streams built into them, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you happen to subscribe. The sports section, more specifically, includes access to the live games that are on now and other scheduled sports content.\n\nOther TV features are tucked away under the three-line hamburger menu icon, like Games, Art & Photos, the Appstore, Music Video & Audio, a now-universal watchlist (“My Stuff”), Settings, and other options.\n\nTo make it easier to access commonly used settings, you can also now long-press on the Home button to adjust settings for the display and audio, set a sleep timer, use accessibility features, access smart home features, and more. From this panel, you can do things like adjust the TV brightness, boost the audio dialogue, or display your Ring camera’s feed on screen while you watch, among other things.\n\nThe redesign also includes rewritten code that makes the interface move faster on some devices, Amazon claims.\n\n“On our most popular devices, this is 20% to 30% faster for the same functions, because it’s all about getting people to what they want to watch, fast,” notes Marcuss.\n\nAI comes built in\n\nOf course, Alexa+ access is built in, allowing users to ask questions, find content, or even do things like call an Uber. This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show’s square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art.\n\nAlexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription.\n\nThe Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. The idea is that people may want to browse for something to watch on their phones instead of just having one person drive the content discovery and search experience with the remote.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nThe refreshed Fire TV interface and mobile app will begin rolling out in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S.\n\nLater this spring, the redesign will come to more countries and more devices, including Fire TV Cube (3rd Gen), the latest generation Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series, and TVs made by partners like Hisense, Panasonic, and TCL.\n\nIt will also be available at launch on the new Amazon Ember Artline TVs. (See below).\n\nEmber Artline TVs: Amazon’s new TVs that look like art\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nThe Ember Artline TVs are Amazon’s latest televisions that ship with a frame that can match your room’s style and colors. They’ll come in 55-inch and 65-inch options, starting at $899.\n\nThe new TVs themselves offer 4K QLED screens with 800 nits of brightness. The display is also thin, at one-and-a-half inches, and has a matte screen finish to reduce glare.\n\nThe TVs also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nHowever, the big selling point is the 10 different frame options you can choose from, offering a variety of colors, textures, and geometries. This allows customers to take better advantage of Fire TV’s Ambient features, which include displaying art when the TV is not in use.\n\nThe colors available include Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver.\n\nFire TV comes with access to over 2,000 pieces of free art, or you can use your own photos.\n\nYou can also ask Alexa+ to display certain photos from your Amazon Photos collections using commands like, “Alexa, create a slideshow of our family trip to Colorado” or “Alexa, show photos from our wedding.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T15:35:26.085506"}

On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.\n\nWhile Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s own Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.\n\nPlus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home.\n\nRelated to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a backseat.)\n\nImage Credits:Screenshot of the new Alexa app\n\nOn the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks, for instance exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, but it also means doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.\n\nMore recently, Amazon has been integrating more services with Alexa+, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.\n\nThe Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nIn addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place.\n\nThis is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed.\n\nThis ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right.\n\n“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons.\n\nHe continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”\n\nBut he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nAlexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since its debut of Alexa+ early last year.\n\nRausch tells us that over 10 million consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy smart home customers also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.\n\nHowever, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are over-represented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”\n\n“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T15:35:26.218741"}

The idea is to perfume your space while the robot cleans, though how noticeable — or welcome — that will be in everyday use remains to be seen.\n\nAside from trying to make your home smell like a spa, the Eufy S2 also is a powerful cleaning machine — at least on paper. It’s rated for up to 30,000Pa of suction, placing it near the top of the category. While suction alone doesn’t tell the whole story, a figure this high suggests the Eufy is designed to handle heavier cleaning jobs, not just basic maintenance. The robot also uses AI-powered obstacle detection and real-time 3D mapping to identify rooms, avoid messes, and steer clear of more than 200 objects, including smaller obstacles like rug tassels.\n\nOn the mopping front, the Eufy S2 includes a roller mop that cleans itself up to six times per second using electrolyzed water, which Anker says helps kill bacteria without relying on added chemical cleaners. It can also lift itself up to two inches to keep carpets dry, while applying up to 3.3 pounds of downward pressure when mopping hard floors. The mop can also extend up to 15mm to better clean along baseboards and edges, and Anker says its new DuoSpiral brush is designed to reduce tangling.\n\nRounding things out is a cleaning station that can refill the onboard water tank, automatically empty the dustbin, and wash and dry its own mops — essentially creating a nearly hands-free cleaning experience.\n\nThe $1,599 robot vacuum will be widely available starting January 20th, with a US presale beginning on January 6th.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-05T11:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T16:38:46.335596"}

For the first time it now features a small screen on the front providing details on power delivery and your connected phone’s charge level.\n\nThe new Anker Nano Charger is comparable in size to the 45W single-port USB-C chargers Anker currently sells, but it delivers more functionality, particularly when used to charge some Apple devices. The charger recognizes and identifies iPhone models dating back to the 15 series, and iPad Pro models from 2020 onwards, when they’re connected. It uses a three-stage power delivery system to manage temperatures to help prolong battery health and shares those details, including the device’s charge level on its screen.

As with similar devices from competitors like Kuxiu, Anker’s 3-in-1 can simultaneously charge a smartphone, your earbuds, and an Apple Watch, but only the phone will charge at 25W. Anker’s differentiating its new charging stand with the addition of an “airflow cooling system” to manage temperatures and help improve charging efficiency, but that added functionality pushes its price to $149.99, making it one of the more expensive 3-in-1 chargers.\n\nThe Nano Power Strip features an adjustable clamp to accommodate desks and tables of varying thickness.

Image: Bosch\n\nThe Bosch 800 Series is one of only a couple of countertop coffee makers that work with Alexa voice control. I’ve been testing it and have had some trouble getting Alexa Plus to consistently make a cup of coffee with a voice command.\n\nBefore Alexa Plus, asking regular Alexa to make me a coffee based on a routine I set up in the Alexa app mostly worked fine. But since the new assistant arrived, Alexa has been frequently confused.\n\nThis is an example of one of the biggest challenges of revamping voice assistants with generative AI. The new versions find it harder to do some of the more straightforward tasks their predecessors excelled at.\n\nOn the flip side, they should be able to do a lot more. At one point, it seemed companies hoped the AI would just figure it out on its own, but now they are having to set up individual integrations again, just as they did with the original Alexa.\n\n“Using natural language, users may now control every aspect of the already-advanced espresso machine.”\n\nBosch says engineering teams at Bosch and Amazon “have worked intensely to fully integrate Alexa Plus” with these new capabilities. The company says that when it launches, you should be able to control every aspect of the espresso machine:\n\n“Using natural language, users may now control every aspect of the already-advanced espresso machine to formulate and improve daily coffee routines. The AI assistant leverages its vast knowledge base, along with machine learning, to pass the command to the espresso machine.”\n\nThe routine I set up with old Alexa required me to select a specific drink type when I programmed it, limiting me to that type, or I had to set up several routines for each drink I might want to make. With this new Alexa Plus upgrade, it sounds like I should be able to ask it to make any drink from its vast library, and it will know what to do.\n\nThat certainly feels more like the experience I expected with Alexa Plus. I’m looking forward to putting this to the test when the integration launches.\n\nBosch brings AI cooking to its appliances\n\nAlong with AI powers in its coffee machine, Bosch is debuting its Bosch Cook AI at CES. The company says this is “an intelligent new solution that combines agentic artificial intelligence, Bosch’s proprietary appliance technologies, sensors and a unique user experience within the Home Connect app.”\n\nBosch Cook AI is designed to provide live guidance through the Home Connect app when you’re prepping and cooking to help you prepare more complex meals, such as “cooking multiple steaks to different levels of doneness, simultaneously.” The system can also “intelligently orchestrate multiple Bosch appliances in tandem,” according to the company.\n\nBosch will be demoing this at CES, and I’ll be on the show floor to check it out.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-05T12:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T17:01:28.605231"}

Now, CES 2026 is bringing us the first actual laptops based on both that silicon and the Snapdragon X2 Plus — a pair of just-announced chips aimed at more budget machines.\n\nPCs with the X2 Elite and ones with the X2 Plus should both arrive around the end of the first quarter, Qualcomm spokesperson Cassandra Garcia-Bacha tells The Verge.\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm isn’t promising particular price points like it did in 2024, when it proclaimed it’d bring the cost of a Snapdragon X laptop down to $700 — which makes sense, I suppose, as the global RAM shortage currently has PC prices in flux. You’ll have to watch this week as various PC makers do — and don’t — announce those prices themselves.\n\nBut Qualcomm senior director Mandar Deshpande tells me that Snapdragon X2 products are “trying to land in similar swim lanes” to the previous generation, whose “Elite” tier started at $1,000, “Plus” at $800, and “X” at $600 and up.\n\nWhile the Plus chips won’t have quite the power of the X2 Elite, it sounds like they’re no slouch. Though the 10-core and 6-core variants have fewer CPU cores than the Elite (which boast 18 and 12, respectively), Qualcomm claims they can still wipe the floor with a competing low-power Intel Lunar Lake or Arrow Lake chip in both CPU performance and efficiency:\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nAnd for AI tasks, they still contain the same 80 TOPS NPU as Qualcomm’s higher-end chips. It claims they’re “the world’s fastest NPU for laptops in its class”:\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nThat said, the Plus won’t have nearly as much GPU for gaming and other graphical tasks. Overall, Qualcomm says you’re looking at up to 35 percent CPU gains and up to 39 percent GPU gains over a previous-gen chip, depending on whether you’re looking at the 10-core or 6-core model, and we liked the Snapdragon X Plus-powered 12-inch Microsoft Surface Pro, as one example.\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nTwenty-nine or 39 percent GPU gains might sound respectable, but it may not be enough to make these good for gaming, and it’s nothing compared to the 2.3x gains Qualcomm boasts for the Elite — and the 6-core chip has dramatically lower GPU frequency than even the 10-core chip, at just 0.9GHz versus 1.7GHz.\n\nQualcomm does say the Plus requires up to 43 percent less power than the previous gen, though, with “multi-day battery life,” and promises they won’t drop performance when you’re on battery. And even the Plus can support up to 128GB of LPDDR5x memory, not that manufacturers are likely to bite in this RAM economy!\n\nIf you plan to game with a Qualcomm + Windows laptop, you’ll be pleased to hear the company says it’s ramping up graphics driver support. It’s not promising day-and-date updates for each hot game as they launch, but Deshpande says Qualcomm is currently pledging quarterly driver updates and already supports some 1,400 games, covering 90 percent of “the most played game titles.” Its Snapdragon Control Panel app should automatically keep GPU drivers up to date, and the drivers should natively support DX 12.2 Ultimate, Vulkan 1.4, and OpenCL 3.0.\n\nWhile Deshpande says both the Plus, like the Elite, can scale to most any wattage for a wide range of designs — remember, portable performance is about cooling as much as or more than the chip — he says most should fall in the 12–35W envelope of traditional thin-and-light laptops, there may be some fanless designs, and we might see mini PCs that add an additional 10W of headroom for extra performance, too.\n\nQualcomm won’t talk about operating systems other than Windows (say, SteamOS) or Windows on Arm handhelds today, though. There’s “a lot of interest on other operating systems, we’re looking at that, we’re working on developing some of those solutions and everything, but CES is not the time we’re announcing support,” says Deshpande.\n\nBut there is one hint: We should keep an eye on the 2026 Game Developers Conference for potential Windows handhelds, Garcia-Bacha tells me.

This will be the first vehicle to come with Amazon’s next-generation voice assistant, the companies announced during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe launch is one part of Amazon’s effort to bring its LLM-powered voice and digital assistant to every device — whether handheld or in the driver’s seat — touched by consumers. Alexa+ is already in more than 600 million devices. And automotive is next on the list.\n\nBringing a custom version of Alexa+ into the BMW iX3 will be an important test for Amazon. Automakers have struggled for years to bring a voice assistant inside vehicles that can handle complex functions and requests that don’t end with the driver yelling in frustration. Efforts to develop natural language processing — a form of AI that lets computers understand and respond to human speech — have been in the works for more than a decade. And while progress has been made, these systems can still be easily stumped by humans.\n\nBMW and Amazon’s Alexa+ partnership has been three years in the making.\n\nBMW announced in 2022 that Amazon Alexa would be the foundation of its next-generation voice assistant. This meant BMW wouldn’t just embed Alexa into its vehicles, but would use Amazon’s technology platform known as Alexa Custom Assistant to build its own custom version. That timeline was extended as Amazon worked on an automotive version of Alexa+, an overhauled voice assistant developed and powered by large language models that promises to deliver seamless and natural conversations, like talking to a human.\n\nAlexa+ was built using Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets AWS customers build apps using generative AI models from Amazon and other third-party partners.

Lucid also said it delivered — meaning sold — 15,841 vehicles across the whole year, a 55% increase over 2024’s figures.\n\nThe stronger finish to 2025 sets Lucid up for an all-important year that will see the company start building the first vehicle on its new mid-sized EV platform. The company has said this first vehicle will cost around $50,000, putting it near the same part of the market as the Tesla Model Y and Rivian’s upcoming R2 SUV.\n\nThe numbers still pale in comparison to the projections Lucid Motors threw around when it went public in a $4 billion reverse merger in 2021. At that time, the company claimed it would deliver 135,000 vehicles in 2025, with 86,000 of those being Gravity SUVs, 42,000 being Air sedans, and the remaining 7,000 coming from its yet-to-debut mid-sized EV.\n\nThose targets quickly became unrealistic as Lucid ran into production, supply, and demand challenges for both of its vehicles, all while navigating an automotive market that was severely disrupted by the pandemic. The company particularly struggled in early 2025 as it started to ramp up production of the Gravity SUV. It has since been dealing with a number of quality issues on the vehicle, to the level that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to customers in December saying that he shared in their “frustration.”\n\n“Lingering software problems have unfortunately affected our customers’ experience and satisfaction.

It’s also a climate super pollutant. Now, several decades after the drug was first introduced, a growing number of US hospitals have stopped using the anesthetic because of its outsized environmental impact. On January 1, the European Union went a step further, prohibiting its use in all but medically necessary cases.\n\nDesflurane is more than 7,000 times more effective at warming the planet over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide on a pound-for-pound basis. However, curbing its use alone won’t solve climate change. The anesthetic contributes only a small fraction of total global warming, which is driven by far larger volumes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions.\n\nStill, emissions from the drug add up. Approximately 1,000 tons of the gas are vented from hospitals and other health care facilities worldwide each year. The emissions have a near-term climate impact equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 1.6 million automobiles.\n\nFor Jodi Sherman, an anesthesiologist at Yale University and medical director of sustainability for the Yale New Haven Health System, the decision to discontinue use of desflurane is clear.\n\n“It has a relatively significant impact in health care delivery in a hospital on the ground and it’s something where we have easy fixes,” said Sherman.\n\nHealth care accounts for 8.5 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, a figure twice the global average for the sector. At the hospital level, approximately 5 percent of climate pollution comes from anesthesia gases. At the same time, less than 5 percent of inhaled anesthetics are metabolized in patients. The vast majority of the gas is simply vented into the atmosphere.\n\nMedical professionals are increasingly viewing health care, and anesthesia in particular, as an opportunity to lead in reducing emissions.\n\n“We have a huge role to play in not just contributing to greenhouse gas emissions but also to be leaders in decreasing US greenhouse gas emissions,” said Shaneeta Johnson, professor of surgery and global health at the School of Global Health at Meharry Medical College in Nashville. “Small changes make a big difference.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:48:07 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T17:01:29.827536"}

According to a paper published in the journal Science Advances, radiocarbon testing dates the site to about 9,500 years ago, prompting a rethinking of group labor and ritual in such ancient hunter-gatherer communities.\n\nMany cultures have practiced some form of cremation. There is a Viking cremation site known as Kalvestene on the small island of Hjarnø in Denmark, for instance. And back in 2023, we reported on an unusual Roman burial site where cremated remains had not been transported to a separate final resting place but remained in place, covered in brick tiles and a layer of lime and surrounded by several dozen bent and twisted nails—possibly an attempt to prevent the deceased from rising from the grave to haunt the living.)\n\nBut the practice was extremely rare among hunter-gatherer societies, since building a pyre is labor-intensive and requires a great deal of communal resources. There is very little evidence of cremation predating the mid-Holocene (between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago). According to the authors of this latest paper, the earliest known concentration of burnt human remains was found at Lake Mungo in Australia and dates back 40,000 years, but there is no evidence of a pyre, making it challenging to determine specific details.\n\nThe oldest pyre discovered thus far is the Xaasaa Na’ site in Alaska, dating to around 11,500 years ago and containing the remains of a 3-year-old child. There is evidence of burned human remains in Egypt dating around 7,500 years ago, but the earliest confirmed cremations in that region only date back 3,300 years.\n\nThat’s what makes the discovery of an intact hunter-gatherer cremation pyre with the remains of an adult woman at the Hora-1 site so significant. Situated under an overhang at the base of a granite hill, Hora-1 was first excavated in the 1950s. Archaeologists determined that it had been a burial ground between 8,000 and 16,000 years ago, with the interment of several intact (uncremated) bodies. The pyre is unique: an ash bed containing 170 bone fragments, mostly from arms and legs. It’s the only example of cremation at the site.\n\nA bed of ash\n\nPatrick Fahy Reconstructed events of the 9,500-year-old pyre. Reconstructed events of the 9,500-year-old pyre.

Offering no apology for Grok’s functionality, X Safety blamed users for prompting Grok to produce CSAM while reminding them that such prompts can trigger account suspensions and possible legal consequences.\n\n“We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary,” X Safety said. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”\n\nX Safety’s post boosted a reply on another thread on the platform in which X owner Elon Musk reiterated the consequences users face for inappropriate prompting. That reply came to a post from an X user, DogeDesigner, who suggested that Grok can’t be blamed for “creating inappropriate images,” despite Grok determining its own outputs.\n\n“That’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad,” DogeDesigner opined. “A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in.”\n\nBut image generators like Grok aren’t forced to output exactly what the user wants, like a pen. One of the reasons the Copyright Office won’t allow AI-generated works to be registered is the lack of human agency in determining what AI image generators spit out. Chatbots are similarly non-deterministic, generating different outputs for the same prompt.\n\nThat’s why, for many users questioning why X won’t filter out CSAM in response to Grok’s generations, X’s response seems to stop well short of fixing the problem by only holding users responsible for outputs.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:42:45 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T17:56:12.911431"}

That would be well up from the 1-million-plus unit mark that Hesai hit in 2025.\n\nHesai’s push to grab more market share comes just one month after leading U.S. lidar-maker Luminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That company is not expected to continue operating once its bankruptcy plan is approved, though it is looking to sell the lidar business.\n\nHesai has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years and is now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong stock exchanges. That’s despite fighting an uphill battle against the U.S. government, which has accused the company of working closely with China’s military industry — a charge that Hesai has challenged.\n\nAt the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Hesai told reporters it was able to double the production target because of “accelerating demand” in the automotive and robotics industries.\n\nThe company’s automotive efforts have been buoyed by the Chinese car market’s adoption of lidar sensors, which Hesai said is now in 25% of new electric cars sold in the country. It also claimed that many new vehicles in China are expected to integrate between three to six lidar sensors per car, “significantly expanding Hesai’s addressable market.” Hesai boasts 24 automotive customers, including a “top European” automaker, and said it has 4 million orders for its newest ATX lidar sensor.\n\nAutomotive has proved to be a fickle market for lidar sensors outside of China. That was one of the contributing factors to Luminar’s downfall, according to the company’s own bankruptcy filings. While Luminar secured deals to integrate its lidar sensors on Volvo, Polestar, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles, those plans fell apart. Volvo had at one point agreed to buy 1.1 million lidar sensors from Luminar, but delays to its new vehicle programs and cost overruns caused the Swedish automaker to back out of the deal. (Volvo ultimately only purchased around 10,000 sensors from Luminar.)\n\nRobotics is not guaranteed to be a successful market for lidar sensors, but some players besides Hesai see great promise. San Francisco-based Ouster, which acquired rival player Velodyne in 2023 as the lidar industry began to consolidate, has said it believes robotics represents a $14 billion market opportunity.

When it detects NFC-equipped smart tags nearby, embedded inside new Lego tiles and new Lego minifigures, or when it sees other Smart Bricks, the company claims it will make entire Lego sets come to life — starting with the humming lightsabers, roaring engines, light-up blasters, and the music of Lego Star Wars.\n\nThese “Smart Bricks” and “Smart Play” initiatives, just announced at CES 2026, aren’t like the huge Lego Mario toys that required two AAA batteries and mostly only activate when their bottom-mounted cameras detect color or barcodes. They’re wirelessly charged, with a pad that can charge multiple bricks at a time, and a battery that “will still perform after years of inactivity.”\n\nThe Lego smart brick (left) is joined by NFC-equipped smart tags tiles (center) and minifigures (right). Image: Lego\n\nThey have light and sound, light sensors, inertial sensors to detect movement, tilt, and gestures, and they form a Bluetooth mesh network with other Smart Bricks, so they’re aware of each other’s position and orientation — so Lego Star Wars ships and figures can do battle, for example, or so The Imperial March plays when you sit Emperor Palpatine on his throne. When built into Lego cars, the bricks could detect which one crosses a finish line first, or change from engine noises to crashing sound effects if the vehicle is flipped over. The computer inside is a custom ASIC that is smaller than a single Lego stud and is firmware updatable via a smartphone app.\n\nThe bricks also have a microphone, one that Lego Group spokesperson Jessica Benson explains is used as a virtual button rather than recording anything. “I’ve seen it where you blow on it, if you put it on a birthday cake, for instance, it makes things happen. It’s very much used as another sensor point, it’s not recording any details, it’s just picking up those inputs that are to do with sound and reacting in real time to what the kids are doing with it.”\n\nThere’s also no AI in this product at all, Benson confirms, and no camera. (Without a camera to scan barcodes, they’re not compatible with Lego Mario tiles.)\n\nThe first sets shipping March 1st will all be Lego Star Wars:\n\nA $70, 473-piece Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter set with one smart brick, one TIE Fighter smart tag, and one Darth Vader smart figure.\n\nA $100, 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set with one smart brick, five tags (X-Wing, Imperial turret, transporter, command center, and “R2-D2 accessories”), and both Luke and Leia smart figs.\n\nA $160, 962-piece Darth Vader’s Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set with two smart bricks, three figs (Luke, Emperor Palpatine, Vader) and five tags (A-Wing, throne, Death Star turret, and two lightsabers).\n\nAt roughly 4 x 4 x 5.5 inches (10 x 11 x 15cm) for the TIE Fighter and 2 x 8.5 x 7.5 (6 x 22 x 19cm) for the X-Wing including little outpost buildings, these are a good bit smaller than the “normal minifig scale” Lego Star Wars ships we’ve gotten in the past — the Smart Bricks add to the cost, as you’d expect.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 6 The 473-piece Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter set comes with one smart brick, one smart tag, and one smart minifigure. Image: Lego\n\nIf all you’re getting for that money is replacing the imaginative laser and humming sounds kids can already make with their own mouths, that’d be one thing — but there’s enough tech in here that they could possibly be much more. Lego spokesperson Jack Rankin suggests the tags can lead to more creative forms of mix-and-match play, too — when kids tried an early smart tag that quacked like a duck and combined that with a helicopter set, they enjoyed having a duck helicopter, too.\n\nIt’s highly unlikely they’ll stop at a few Lego Star Wars sets. The Lego Group is calling the new computer bricks “the most significant evolution in the Lego System-in-Play since the introduction of the Lego Minifigure in 1978,” and there are unconfirmed rumors that the upcoming Lego Pokémon sets will be the next to get them. The company already quietly piloted them in 2024 in a Lego City set, too.\n\n“Lego Smart Play will continue to expand through new updates, launches and technology,” the company writes.\n\nIt’s definitely not the computer brick I asked Lego to make — but I’m looking very forward to trying them this week at CES.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-05T14:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:02:44.325489"}

The original post by user Trowaway_whistleblow alleged that an unnamed food delivery company regularly delays customer orders, calls couriers “human assets,” and exploits their “desperation” for cash, among other indefensible actions. Nearly 90,000 upvotes and four days later, it’s become increasingly clear that the post’s text is probably AI-generated.\n\nConsidering the delivery app industry track record of exploitation of its drivers, it’s easy to see why so many people believed this was the real thing.\n\nThe Verge put the original 586-word Reddit post through several free online AI detectors, in addition to Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude. The results were mixed: Copyleaks, GPTZero, Pangram, Gemini, and Claude all pegged it as likely AI-generated, but ZeroGPT and QuillBot both reported it as human-written. ChatGPT played it down the middle.\n\nReached by The Verge on Signal, Trowaway_whistleblow provided an image of an Uber Eats employee badge. That image was generated or edited with Google AI, according to Gemini. The image shows an Uber Eats logo above two black boxes, presumably covering an employee name and photo, and the words “senior software engineer.” It’s odd that an engineer’s badge would have the Uber Eats logo, and not the Uber logo, according to Gemini. That, in addition to slightly misaligned words and warped coloration at the edge of the green border, are reasons Gemini thinks it’s inauthentic. (Uber later confirmed that Uber Eats-branded employee badges do not exist.)\n\nThe Verge was not the only news outlet communicating with Trowaway_whistleblow. Casey Newton of Platformer and Hard Fork also received an employee badge photo, which Gemini flagged as AI.\n\nHard Reset, a Substack publication, reported that Trowaway_whistleblow gave reporter Alex Shultz a purportedly internal Uber document — but quickly deleted their Signal account once Shultz began pressing about the authenticity of the document. The Verge’s chat with Trowaway_whistleblow shows a message saying “This person isn’t using Signal.”\n\nUber denies the content of the Reddit post and the employee badge photo. “Not only are the claims fake, but they’re also dead wrong,” Uber spokesperson Noah Edwardsen told The Verge. Uber Eats’ Andrew Macdonald wrote on X, “This post is definitively not about us. I suspect it is completely made up. Don’t trust everything you read on the internet.”\n\nAnd DoorDash CEO Tony Xu also denied the redditor’s “appalling” allegations in a post on X. “This is not DoorDash, and I would fire anyone who promoted or tolerated the kind of culture described in this Reddit post,” Xu wrote.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-05T13:43:02-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:02:44.505794"}

The update adds interactive lights and sound to the Lego experience—including the Minifigs.", "content": "At CES in Las Vegas today, Lego has unveiled its new Smart Play platform, aimed at taking its distinctly analog plastic blocks and figures into a new world of tech-powered interactive play—but crucially one without any reliance on screens.\n\nSmart Play revolves around Lego's patented sensor- and tech-packed brick. It's the same size as a standard 2x4 Lego brick, but it is capable of connecting to compatible Smart Minifigures and Smart Tags and interacting with then in real time. By pairing these components, kids big and small can create context-appropriate sounds and light effects as they play with the Danish company's toys.\n\nFor example, launching on March 1, the $100 Lego Star Wars Smart Play Luke’s Red Five X-Wing 584-piece building set will feature two Smart Minifigs—Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia—plus five Smart Tags that will offer up laser-shooting sounds, engine sounds, and light effects, as well as refueling and repair sounds. All of the sounds are coordinated by the set's central Smart Brick brain.\n\nTwo more Lego Star Wars Smart Play sets drop on the same day, but all three are available for preorder from January 9. One is a 473-piece Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter kit ($70) with ion engine sound effects, but the pick of the three could well be the $160, 962-piece Throne Room Duel set with three Smart Minifigures of Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, and Luke Skywalker. The combination of the brick brain plus connected figures will apparently let players recreate (or indeed rewrite) the final lightsaber battle—complete with humming laser sword sounds—between Luke and Vader at the end of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. You can even listen to “The Imperial March” as Emperor Palpatine watches the fight from his throne.\n\nLego's 962-piece Throne Room Duel set comes with three Smart Minifigures of Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, and Luke Skywalker. Photograph: Courtesy of Lego\n\nLego is claiming this Smart Play platform developed in house by the company’s Creative Play Lab team in collaboration with Capgemini's Cambridge Consultants “features more than 20 patented world-firsts within its technology.”\n\nThe heart of the system is the Smart Brick's custom-made chip, measuring smaller than a standard Lego stud. Other elements crammed into the eight-stud brick are an LED light array, accelerometers, light sensors, and sound sensor, and even a miniature speaker.\n\nThe internal battery will supposedly work even after years of inactivity, and to avoid any need for cable access to the Smart Brick once it's built into a beloved creation, Lego has also added wireless charging.

Maybe you need them to work where you can clearly hear your surroundings, or battery life is crucial. No matter your reason, you can save $70 on the Beats Solo 4 at both Amazon and Best Buy in a variety of colors.\n\nUnlike most Beats headphones, which have a distinctly bass-forward sound profile, Apple's influence has been increasingly toning down the brashness in favor of a more balanced and delicate approach. As a result, they have a tone that reviewer Ryan Waniata described as “tempered with a pleasant layer of smoky warmth.” The sound isn't as impressive as on more expensive pairs, but it’s an enjoyable listen. Like most Beats headphones, they lack any kind of custom equalizer, so you're stuck with how they sound out of the box, for better or worse.\n\nAesthetically, they're what you'd expect from Beats, with classic colors like matte black and slate blue, as well as more eye-catching pink hues in both metallic and matte finishes. The compact on-ears fold neatly away for traveling or tossing in your gym bag, while still being comfortable enough for several hours of wear at a time. They also have decent sound isolation as a result, which helps offset the lack of proper ANC.\n\nDespite being produced by Apple, the Beats headphones are happy to work with both Android and iOS devices, and they support one-touch pairing for both sides of the aisle. Depending on your platform, you'll still get access to Find My features and voice activation, but device switching is only for Google users, and there's a distinct lack of auto-pause. They do have great range, however, which makes up for some of the oddities.\n\nWhile the Beats Solo 4 don't quite make the top cut for our favorite wireless headphones overall, the on-ear design and lack of ANC are a unique combination of features that may appeal to specific users and use cases.

One, which would still be called Western Digital, would focus on spinning hard drives, which are no longer used much in consumer systems but remain important to NAS devices and data centers. The other, called SanDisk, would handle solid-state storage, including the drives that Western Digital sold to consumers under its Blue, Black, Green, and Red brands.\n\nThat split effectively undid what Western Digital did a decade ago when it bought SanDisk for $19 billion. And we’re just now starting to see the way the split will affect the company’s existing consumer drives.\n\nToday SanDisk announced that mainstream WD Blue and WD Black SSDs would be going away, to be replaced by SanDisk Optimus-branded disks with the same model numbers.\n\nWD Blue drives will just be “SanDisk Optimus” drives now, starting with the Optimus 5100, a rebadged version of the WD Blue SN5100. Mid-tier WD Black drives will be branded as “SanDisk Optimus GX,” and the Optimus GX 7100 will replace the WD Black SN7100. And high-end WD Black drives will become “SanDisk Optimus GX Pro” SSDs, with the Optimus GX Pro 850X and 8100 replacing the WD Black SN850X and 8100 drives.\n\nGiven that these are all fast NVMe SSDs, I suspect the average user would have trouble detecting much of a difference between the low-end WD Blue/Optimus drives and the high-end WD Black/Optimus GX Pro SSDs. But the functional differences between the drives remain the same as before: the Blue/Optimus 5100 uses somewhat slower and less durable quad-level cell (QLC) flash memory, while the Black/Optimus GX 7100 uses triple-level cell (TLC) memory. The Black/Optimus GX Pro 8100 maximizes performance by stepping up to a PCIe 5.0 interface instead of PCIe 4.0 and including a dedicated DRAM cache (the 5100 and 7100 each claim a small chunk of your system RAM for this, called the Host Memory Buffer, or HMB).

The SMART Bricks and Minifigures can sense nearby SMART Tags, which are 2×2 studless tiles with unique digital IDs that tell the Bricks and Minifigures how to act.\n\nIf the SMART Tag comes in a set for building a helicopter, for example, then the Smart Brick will light up and make propeller sounds that would help bring a helicopter to life. Its built-in accelerometer would make these lights and sounds more consistent with how you’re actually playing with the helicopter, since the Brick will be able to sense when the helicopter is zooming through the sky or turned upside down.\n\nImage Credits:LEGO\n\nThe SMART Bricks are powered by a patented ASIC chip, which is smaller than the size of a single LEGO stud. The chip uses near-field magnetic positioning to recognize the Tags around it, as well as a miniature speaker, accelerometer, and LED array. LEGO also developed a Bluetooth-based protocol called BrickNet, which allows multiple SMART Bricks to recognize each other and operate in tandem. The company claims that BrickNet is protected by enhanced encryption and privacy controls (all of which is necessary, but imagine a world where hacking into toys wasn’t a concern!).\n\nThere’s no setup required to pair the elements of the SMART Play system, making it easy for kids to get started — and parents will be pleased to note that there are no screens involved in the SMART system at all.

Developers can fine-tune Alpamayo into smaller, faster versions for vehicle development, use it to train simpler driving systems, or build tools on top of it like auto-labeling systems that automatically tag video data or evaluators that check if a car made a smart decision.\n\n“They can also use Cosmos to generate synthetic data and then train and test their Alpamayo-based AV application on the combination of the real and synthetic dataset,” Kani said. Cosmos is Nvidia’s brand of generative world models, AI systems that create a representation of a physical environment so they can make predictions and take actions.\n\nAs part of the Alpamayo rollout, Nvidia is also releasing an open dataset with more than 1,700 hours of driving data collected across a range of geographies and conditions, covering rare and complex real-world scenarios. The company is additionally launching AlpaSim, an open-source simulation framework for validating autonomous driving systems.

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nBoston Dynamics unveiled the latest version of its humanoid Atlas robot Monday at CES in Las Vegas. The robot, with a glowing circle for a face and a fully electric, battery-powered body, is so advanced that it will soon be working alongside human factory workers for parent company Hyundai, the companies claimed.\n\nHyundai said it plans on mass-producing Atlas as “production-ready humanoid robots” that will be put to work at the automaker’s car plants, starting with the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant in Savannah, Georgia. The company estimates it will produce 30,000 robots annually starting in 2028.\n\nThe company also plans on putting the first Atlas robots to work that year “on processes with proven safety and quality benefits, such as parts sequencing.” By 2030, Hyundai says that Atlas will level up to tasks involving “repetitive motions, heavy loads, and other complex operations.” The automaker envisions a “harmonious collaboration between humans and robots,” despite widespread fears about job losses as a result of increased automation.\n\nBoston Dynamics started as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992. The company used funding from DARPA to create robots like BigDog, but is best known for the viral fame its robots have found online. Its two main stars have been Atlas, a humanoid bipedal robot that can run and do backflips, and Spot, a smaller quadrupedal “dog” that’s been tested in a variety of scenarios, from sheep herding to assisting health care workers during the pandemic.\n\nThe company started selling Spot in June 2020 for $74,500, targeting businesses looking for an automated way to patrol and inspect warehouses. Despite the viral fame, Boston Dynamics has consistently lost millions of dollars annually for a number of years.\n\nHyundai acquired Boston Dynamics in 2021 in a deal that valued the company at $1.1 billion. The automaker has long predicted that robots will become an increasingly noticeable presence at its factories over time. And with today’s demonstration, Hyundai is hoping to prove that its robot is more advanced and more capable of performing physical tasks than rivals like Tesla’s Optimus robot. Tesla has ridden a wave of AI hype in recent years to a market capitalization of over $1 trillion, over 15 times Hyundai’s value, despite selling vastly fewer cars.\n\nBy 2030, Hyundai says that Atlas will level up to tasks involving “repetitive motions, heavy loads, and other complex operations.”\n\nThe shift for Atlas from research platform to commercial robot is certainly a significant milestone for Boston Dynamics and its parent company. It’s also likely to be an extremely costly endeavor for Hyundai to put Atlas into volume production. The companies haven’t said how much Atlas costs to manufacture, but Boston Dynamics does sell its Spot robots for around $75,000 a unit. Atlas is estimated to be hundreds of thousands of dollars more expensive.\n\nHyundai claims its supply chain, access to advanced manufacturing facilities, and previous work on AI-based software and software-defined vehicles give it a unique advantage that will enable it to scale up its robot production while also keeping costs low.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n1 / 2 Image: Hyundai\n\nThose costs are likely to rise as Atlas becomes more dextrous and autonomous. Hyundai said that the latest, all-electric version of the robot has 56 degrees of freedom (DoF), up from the 50 DoF that was reported in April 2025. The robot has fully rotational joints and “human-scale hands with tactile sensing” and is engineered to handle tasks autonomously. It can be taught “most tasks” in a day, can replace its own batteries automatically for all-day continuous use, and can lift up to 110 pounds (50kg). It’s also water resistant and can operate in temperatures as low as -4 and as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 40 degrees Celsius).\n\nFor years, Boston Dynamics has impressed with demonstrations of its dexterous biped bots performing cartwheels, breakdances, and barrel rolls. Still, the news that Hyundai is on the cusp of putting Atlas to work at its factories may change the public’s perception of the seemingly friendly robot, especially if it emerges as a potential Terminator of jobs. Amazon, for example, is hoping its robots can replace more than 600,000 jobs in the US by 2033, according to recently leaked strategy documents. Hyundai has said that by 2028, its $21 billion investment in the US will create 14,000 jobs directly, and more than 100,000 if indirect jobs are included.\n\nHyundai is also announcing a partnership with Google’s DeepMind AI research lab to combine Boston Dynamics’ robotic expertise with Google’s AI foundation models. The automaker is also sourcing AI chips and software from Nvidia.\n\nOf course, shifting from impressive demos to a working product that can justify its enormous costs will be an equally enormous challenge for Hyundai and Boston Dynamics.

Yours truly let out an unholy cackle because the mirror told me I look 11 years younger than I actually am. All hail the protective powers of sunscreen.\n\nThis particular smart mirror is Nuralogix’s $899 Longevity Mirror. It uses something called “transdermal optical imaging” to measure blood flow patterns in your face. From that, it assesses a variety of health metrics, including heart rate, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease risk, metabolic health, physiological age, and even mental health. All of these metrics then feed into a longevity score from 1 to 100. The higher the number, the better.\n\nThis sort of tech should be taken with a grain of salt. I mean, sure, the mirror correctly sussed that I was anxious and had so-so sleep. The heart rate measurement was on par with my smartwatch. I know my average blood pressure, and that was in the right ballpark, too. (A Nuralogix rep told me that the blood pressure metric is currently undergoing the FDA clearance process.) My colleague Antonio Di Benedetto said he got similar heart rate and blood pressure results during his demo. He was also one of the lucky journalists who got a result close to their actual age. However, it was off about my body mass index as it didn’t actually have my real height or weight plugged in.\n\nNuralogix is also working on a health concierge service that connects you to a health professional to get further insight into their results. That will cost extra at $399 per year. Otherwise, there’s a built-in AI assistant that can help parse results.

The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.\n\n“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.”\n\nThe Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024, is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.\n\nRubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services. Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.\n\nNamed for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.\n\nExplaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems.\n\n“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Image: HP\n\nNext is a similarly sized, yet more cutting-edge, 27-inch model called the Omen 27qs. It bumps the refresh rate up to 500Hz and is HP’s first monitor to don its new HyperX ProLuma branding for factory color calibration. It has an average Delta E less than one, so it should be more color-accurate than the Omen 27q or any other monitor that advertises an average Delta E less than two.\n\nMoving on, it also adds a USB-C video port with 100W PD power passthrough, plus a KVM switch via a dedicated button on the bottom of the monitor. Other ports include USB-B data upstream and two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 downstream. This display boasts HDR support and FreeSync Premium Pro, and it has VESA’s ClearMR 21000 certification that provides some assurance that the monitor doesn’t exhibit gnarly motion blur at high refresh rates.

It’s a WQHD 21:9 display (3,440 x 1,440 resolution) with a 360Hz refresh rate that’ll cost $1,199. Like the 27qs, it has HyperX ProLuma color calibration, a dedicated KVM button, and a VESA ClearMR 21000 rating. It also has the same port selection, but it might be worth considering if you want all of those specs (sans 500Hz refresh rate) in a 1800R curved screen.

He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nNearly one year ago to the day, Dell killed off its long-standing XPS brand name in favor of milquetoast Premium, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max monikers — but it’s back for CES 2026. The new XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops look to win back fans of the “Extreme Performance System” with Dell’s thinnest designs to date, a row of proper function keys, improved battery life, and Intel’s new Panther Lake Core Ultra Series 3 processors. Dell even went as far as putting the XPS brand name on the lid, and finally marking the edges of its seamless haptic trackpad with subtle glass etching lines.\n\nThe XPS 14 and 16 are launching in select configurations on January 6th, with entry-level and higher-end configs coming in February. For now, the XPS 14 at launch starts at $1,649.99 and the XPS 16 at $1,849.99. If you’re growing increasingly Windows-averse, Dell says an XPS 14 running Ubuntu 24.04 will come “later this year.”\n\nThe sleek graphite color will come first. The champagne-like “shimmer” color is due out later this year. The latticeless keyboard returns, but it brings with it some much-appreciated trackpad boundary lines.\n\nThe new XPS laptops sport three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, 10W speakers, and weigh as little as 3 pounds / 1.36 kg (14-inch) or 3.65 pounds / 1.65 kg (16-inch). They’re set to start with 1920 x 1200 IPS displays, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, a 512GB SSD, and Intel’s Core Ultra 5 325 chip. Both sizes can be configured with extra-bright tandem OLEDs (2880 x 1800 for the 14-inch and 3200 x 2000 for the 16-inch) that are each a little thinner and lighter, and chip options will go up to Intel’s Core Ultra X9 388H (coming later).\n\nNeither the XPS 14 or 16 offer discrete graphics, but Dell is touting these new laptops as battery champs, thanks in part to their 70Whr cells and variable refresh displays that go from a maximum 120Hz all the way down to 1Hz when viewing static subjects like emails and photos. (Yes, even the base IPS displays can reach 1Hz.)\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 Three pounds is light enough to be three-finger-liftable.\n\nI had a brief hands-on with the new XPS 14 and 16 laptops at an early preview event Dell hosted in December, where COO Jeff Clarke came out onstage wearing an XPS shirt, hat metaphorically in hand about last year’s branding change. “We’ve been a bit off-course in our PC business,” Clarke said to a room full of media he was trying hard to sway. He promised that Dell is going to “get back on course” and “get back to our roots.” Onstage T-shirt messaging from executives still makes me cringe, but the new XPS laptops look promising.\n\nThe all-aluminum build on the early units felt very sleek. And just the addition of the trackpad etchings and physical function row should go part of the way to remedying my many issues with the last XPS 13. Sadly, the latticeless keyboard I loathe is here to stay on the new models — though not all of them.\n\nLooking very MacBook Air there, Dell. Image: Dell\n\nThat’s because Dell is also teasing a new XPS 13 coming later in 2026, and it’s claiming it will be the thinnest and lightest XPS laptop ever, with a thickness of less than 13mm. For reference, a 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is 11.3mm thick, and the new XPS 14 and XPS 16 are as thin as 14.62mm when each is outfitted with an OLED. One big change for the XPS 13 will be a switch back to a traditional chiclet-style keyboard. Dell’s design head, Justin Lyles, tells The Verge it’s “more cost efficient to execute on a chiclet-style keyboard.” And Dell is aiming for a lower price point with the XPS 13.\n\nDell didn’t fully reverse course on last year’s awkward branding change, but this revitalization of XPS laptops seems like a step in the right direction. For years, XPS laptops were a go-to option for Windows users who wanted a MacBook Pro-like laptop for Windows. The new XPS 14 and XPS 16 certainly look the part, and my behind-glass glimpse of the XPS 13 (which I wasn’t allowed to photograph) was practically a MacBook Air impersonator. If Dell is dialing back some of the originality in its designs in favor of improved functionality and clearer branding, I’ll take it.\n\nPhotography by Antonio G.

{"title": "Jensen Huang Says Nvidia’s New Vera Rubin Chips Are in ‘Full Production’", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/nvidias-rubin-chips-are-going-into-production/", "summary": "The chip giant says Vera Rubin will sharply cut the cost of training and running AI models, strengthening the appeal of its integrated computing platform.", "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says that the company’s next-generation AI superchip platform, Vera Rubin, is on schedule to begin arriving to customers later this year. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production,” Huang said during a press event on Monday at the annual CES technology trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nRubin will cut the cost of running AI models to about one-tenth of Nvidia’s current leading chip system, Blackwell, the company told analysts and journalists during a call on Sunday. Nvidia also said Rubin can train certain large models using roughly one-fourth as many chips as Blackwell requires. Taken together, those gains could make advanced AI systems significantly cheaper to operate and make it harder for Nvidia’s customers to justify moving away from its hardware.\n\nNvidia said on the call that two of its existing partners, Microsoft and CoreWeave, will be among the first companies to begin offering services powered by Rubin chips later this year. Two major AI data centers that Microsoft is currently building in Georgia and Wisconsin will eventually include thousands of Rubin chips, Nvidia added. Some of Nvidia’s partners have started running their next-generation AI models on early Rubin systems, the company said.\n\nThe semiconductor giant also said it’s working with Red Hat, which makes open source enterprise software for banks, automakers, airlines, and government agencies, to offer more products that will run on the new Rubin chip system.\n\nNvidia’s latest chip platform is named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who reshaped how scientists understand the properties of galaxies. The system includes six different chips, including the Rubin GPU and a Vera CPU, both of which are built using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 3-nanometer fabrication process and the most advanced bandwidth memory technology available. Nvidia’s sixth-generation interconnect and switching technologies link the various chips together.\n\nEach part of this chip system is “completely revolutionary and the best of its kind,” Huang proclaimed during the company’s CES press conference.\n\nNvidia has been developing the Rubin system for years, and Huang first announced the chips were coming during a keynote speech in 2024. Last year, the company said that systems built on Rubin would begin arriving in the second half of 2026.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly what Nvidia means by saying that Vera Rubin is in “full production.” Typically, production for chips this advanced—which Nvidia is building with its longtime partner TSMC—starts at low volume while the chips go through testing and validation and ramps up at a later stage.\n\n“This CES announcement around Rubin is to tell investors, ‘We’re on track,’” says Austin Lyons, an analyst at Creative Strategists and author of the semiconductor industry newsletter Chipstrat. There were rumors on Wall Street that the Rubin GPU was running behind schedule, Lyons says, so Nvidia is now pushing back by saying it has cleared key development and testing steps, and it’s confident Rubin is still on course to begin scaling up production in the second half of 2026.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia had to delay delivery of its then-new Blackwell chips due to a design flaw that caused them to overheat when they were connected together in server racks. Shipments for Blackwell were back on schedule by the middle of 2025.\n\nAs the AI industry rapidly expands, software companies and cloud service providers have had to fiercely compete for access to Nvidia’s newest GPUs. Demand will likely be just as high for Rubin. But some firms are also hedging their bets by investing in their own custom chip designs. OpenAI, for example, has said it is working with Broadcom to build bespoke silicon for its next generation of AI models. These partnerships highlight a longer-term risk for Nvidia: Customers that design their own chips can gain a level of control over their hardware that the company doesn’t offer.\n\nBut Lyons says today’s announcements demonstrate how Nvidia is evolving beyond merely offering GPUs to becoming a “full AI system architect, spanning compute, networking, memory hierarchy, storage, and software orchestration.” Even as hyperscalers pour money into custom silicon, he adds, Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform “is getting harder to displace.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:05:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T23:26:51.656518"}

New data for 2026 indicates he could be right.", "content": "A couple of weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” as its word of the year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella weighed in on what to expect from AI in 2026.\n\nIn his classic, intellectual style, Nadella wrote on his personal blog that he wants us to stop thinking of AI as “slop” and start thinking of it as “bicycles for the mind.”\n\nHe wrote, “A new concept that evolves ‘bicycles for the mind’ such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute.”\n\nHe continued: “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”\n\nIf you parse through those syllables, you may see that he’s not only urging everyone to stop thinking of AI-generated content as slop, but also wants the tech industry to stop talking about AI as a replacement for humans. He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.\n\nHere’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of replacing human labor as a way to price it, and justify its expense.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in an interview on 60 Minutes.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nYet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind checking the AI’s work for accuracy).\n\nOne oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg, which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.\n\nWhile this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is how much of a job can be offloaded to AI. It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the tasks it cites as examples include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.\n\nThat’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called Blood in the Machine. Then there are the high unemployment rates among new grad junior coders.\n\nBut it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.\n\nSo it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nThe Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable.\n\nThe irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its last fiscal year, which closed in June — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a public memo about the layoffs after these results.\n\nNotably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he did say that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).\n\nThe truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 AI is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones.\n\nTo be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, CNBC reported. That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and other tech companies chasing AI.\n\nAnd to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses, too.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:09:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T23:26:51.906997"}

On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.\n\nBuilt on a Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted “halo.” The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work).\n\nCrucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it’s being built at Lucid Motors’ Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)\n\nThe vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.\n\nAnyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians.\n\nThe companies did not have an interactive version of the software — which is being created by Uber — ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity’s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel.\n\nUber chose to build this forthcoming “premium” robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.)\n\nThat said, the Gravity’s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the “frustrations” they experienced.\n\nLucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday announced that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid’s factory lines in Arizona.

GR00T relies on Cosmos Reason as its brain, and it unlocks whole-body control for humanoids so they can move and handle objects simultaneously.\n\nNvidia also introduced Isaac Lab-Arena at CES, an open-source simulation framework hosted on GitHub that serves as another component of the company’s physical AI platform, enabling safe virtual testing of robotic capabilities.\n\nThe platform promises to address a critical industry challenge: as robots learn increasingly complex tasks, from precise object handling to cable installation, validating these abilities in physical environments can be costly, slow, and risky. Isaac Lab-Arena tackles this by consolidating resources, task scenarios, training tools, and established benchmarks like Libero, RoboCasa, and RoboTwin, creating a unified standard where the industry previously lacked one.\n\nSupporting the ecosystem is Nvidia OSMO, an open-source command center that serves as connective infrastructure that integrates the entire workflow from data generation through training across both desktop and cloud environments.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Nvidia is pitching it as a cost-effective on-device compute upgrade that delivers 1200 teraflops of AI compute and 64 gigabytes of memory while running efficiently at 40 to 70 watts.\n\nNvidia is also deepening its partnership with Hugging Face to let more people experiment with robot training without needing expensive hardware or specialized knowledge. The collaboration integrates Nvidia’s Isaac and GR00T technologies into Hugging Face’s LeRobot framework, connecting Nvidia’s 2 million robotics developers with Hugging Face’s 13 million AI builders. The developer platform’s open-source Reachy 2 humanoid now works directly with Nvidia’s Jetson Thor chip, letting developers experiment with different AI models without being locked into proprietary systems.\n\nThe bigger picture here is that Nvidia is trying to make robotics development more accessible, and it wants to be the underlying hardware and software vendor powering it, much like Android is the default for smartphone makers.\n\nThere are early signs that Nvidia’s strategy is working.

The company also showed off an SUV concept that it said would inform a production model in the US for as early as 2028.\n\nThe new Afeela Prototype 2026 looked remarkably similar to the Afeela 1 pre-production unit, with short overhangs, a long wheelbase, and an overall larger footprint.

SHM CEO Yasuhide Mizuno called it an “early-stage concept.”\n\nImage: SHM\n\nThe announcement of customer deliveries, though, was arguably more notable. The Sony-Honda joint venture has been a regular presence at CES since first revealing its Vision-S concept in 2020. Since then, the companies have inched closer to production, but not close enough to offer us a test drive or anything beyond a hands-on with the high-powered infotainment system. Earlier this month, SHM said it had started trial production of the Afeela 1 at Honda’s East Liberty Auto Plant in Ohio.\n\nIn advance of deliveries, SHM said it would offer phased demo drives to early reservation holders. The company also said it would extend sales to Arizona, in addition to California, in 2027. Japanese customers can expect first deliveries to commence in early 2027, Mizuno said.\n\nIn some respects, Afeela feels more like a platform for Sony’s entertainment offerings than a driving machine. It boasts screens across the width of the dashboard, 40 sensors and cameras for semi-autonomous driving assistance, all-wheel drive, and hints at augmented reality integration and “virtual worlds” embedded into the driving experience. Sony recently said that Playstation 5 owners would be able to stream games directly on to the vehicle’s infotainment system.\n\nWhen it does go on sale, Afeela will be entering a crowded market for EVs priced above $90,000.

The HX 475 now offers 60 TOPS, while the HX 470 offers 55.\n\nThey’re similar enough that AMD largely dodged a question about how much faster they are when we asked, instead comparing them against Intel’s Lunar Lake (not the new Panther Lake) chips:\n\nCompared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.

The latest transformer model is designed to improve image quality overall and reduce some of the artifacting that we saw with DLSS 4.\n\nThe main DLSS 4.5 features will benefit all RTX owners. Image: Nvidia\n\n“This second-generation model is our most sophisticated yet,” says Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “It utilizes 5x the compute power over the original transformer model, it’s trained on a significantly expanded high-fidelity dataset, and it also takes full advantage of our GeForce RTX 40- and 50-series GPUs, which benefit from faster and more advanced Tensor Cores.”\n\nNvidia has updated its DLSS model to better understand scenes in games so it can use game engine data to improve lighting, finer edges, and motion clarity. In a briefing, Nvidia demonstrated improvements to DLSS 4.5 in a variety of games. Ghosting is reduced in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, anti-aliasing is improved in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and there is less shimmering in certain scenes in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.\n\nNvidia’s new 6x Multi Frame Generation is designed for 240Hz monitors. Image: Nvidia\n\nWhile the AI model improvements to DLSS 4.5 will benefit all RTX owners today, Nvidia is also launching a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series owners in spring. Targeted at 240Hz 4K gaming, the 6x mode will generate five additional fake frames for every single rendered one, instead of the maximum of three additional in DLSS 4.\n\nNvidia is also launching a Dynamic Multi Frame Generation mode that automatically switches between different Multi Frame Generation levels depending on when you need more or less fake frames. “When things are really graphically intense, it upshifts and increases the Frame Generation required to bridge the performance dips, ensuring that your high refresh rate monitor remains buttery smooth,” explains Lin. “When the workload lightens, it seamlessly shifts the multiplier down to compute only what’s needed.”\n\nDLSS 4.5 will be available for more than 400 games and apps through Nvidia’s app today, allowing RTX owners to force 4.5 on in games that haven’t been updated yet. Nvidia is only committing to a vague “spring 2026” timeframe for its 6x Multi Frame Generation and Dynamic Frame Generation modes for RTX 50-series owners.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T00:04:55-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T05:13:55.452374"}

Most of the appliances will also offer a built-in speaker so that they can react audibly to the commands. IAI Smart emphasizes the ease of use that this offers. “Our guiding principle is simple: make smart home technology easier for everyone,” said Jason Jiang, CEO of IAI Smart. “Voice control should be effortless, and now it is.” And because everything is on-device, personal information never leaves the home.\n\nThe first devices with this technology include:\n\nSmartVoice Tower Fans, which come in 29-inch ($89.99), 40-inch $99.99), and 42-inch models ($119.99), and which will offer three speeds, 15-hour sleep timers, LED touch displays, over 40 voice commands, and (if you’re into aromatherapy) an integrated scent diffuser.\n\nSmartVoice Fan-Heaters, which come in 25-inch ($129.99) and 32-inch ($169.99) models and which will supply wide-angle 1500-watt heating with anti-tipping features and auto-shutoff timers.

In the coming months, Nvidia is planning to launch native GeForce Now apps for Linux and Amazon’s Fire TV devices, alongside flight control support for its cloud gaming service.\n\nThe native Linux app is a highly requested feature for GeForce Now, especially as subscribers have had to rely on unofficial apps or browser tweaks to get access to the service. A beta of GeForce Now for Linux will be available initially for Ubuntu 24.04 and newer soon, nearly a year after Nvidia made it easier to access GeForce Now on the Linux-based SteamOS.\n\n“Right now, the GeForce Now Linux app is going to launch first as a beta on Ubuntu 24.04 primarily because this is a long-term support release that enables stable graphics drivers and consistent system libraries,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “As we continually test the app, we’re going to be expanding formal support to additional [Linux] distributions in the coming weeks.”\n\nNvidia is also further expanding GeForce Now into the living room with support for Amazon Fire TV devices. The app will launch early this year for Fire TV Stick 4K Plus and 4K Max initially, allowing owners to stream PC games to their TV with just a controller.\n\nYou’ll be able to use joysticks and yokes with GeForce Now soon.

Cue a pedantic audiophile pointing out that the whole premise of open-ear buds is to not block out sound. Yes, yes. But the unfortunate truth is that often means if you want open-ear buds for one situation, you’ll have to buy a second pair for when the train is screeching along the subway tracks while the local mariachi band starts busking in your car.\n\nSo I was intrigued when Shokz reached out to say at CES 2026, its new $249.95 OpenFit Pro buds would have “noise cancellation.”\n\nTechnically, the correct term is noise reduction. Active noise cancellation requires a sealed ear canal, whereas the OpenFit Pro don’t do that. Instead, the buds have a triple microphone array, a tweaked speaker design, and an adaptive algorithm to dampen unwanted environmental noise. Two of the microphones monitor environmental sounds, while a third microphone next to your ear tracks what’s reaching the canal.\n\nSee that third microphone array? That’s what monitors sounds that actually reach your ear.\n\nI was deeply skeptical when Shokz first briefed me on the product. I’ve tested several Shokz open-ear buds (not to be confused with their bone conduction headphones). While they’re great for staying aware at home or in quiet areas, they’re Not Great, Bob for commuting. I often can’t hear my music — even at maximum volume — and forget audiobooks or podcasts!\n\nTo my surprise, whatever dark magic Shokz is using in these buds works pretty well. The difference is very noticeable, especially if you turn the reduction setting all the way up in the Shokz app.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. True ANC is still better. It’s always going to be hard listening to audiobooks if there’s a live mariachi band in my train car. (To be fair, ANC headphones also struggle against the power of mariachi.) But during less disruptive commutes, I had little problem listening to music and was able to listen to my audiobooks in more scenarios. I’d say these are best suited to moderately loud environments. Think cafes, not so much bars.\n\nAt home, I was surprised at how well the buds masked the ambient hum of my air purifier and fridge. Of course, it’s no match for the TV if you’ve got a show going on in the background, but that’s not really the point. This is more or less the kind of earbud that lets you focus on your content, but still hear when your spouse yell-asks from another room if you’ve seen their keys.\n\nI’m much less fond of the fit. The hook is still quite bulky around the ear.\n\nIn another plus, bass quality — another weakness for open-ear buds — has improved as well. This iteration of the OpenFit Pro now supports a range up to 40kHz and reduces distortion below 100Hz. There’s also Dolby Atmos support with head tracking, but that felt sort of gimmicky when I turned it on. Nice if that’s something you like, but not all that necessary with open-ear buds.\n\nThe main issues I’ve had in the past few weeks of testing are, once again, fit and design. The hooks still feel bulky behind the ear, especially when I wear them with glasses. Oftentimes, I don’t feel they sit on my ears as securely as I’d like. The case is also large, though I do appreciate the extra 50 hours of charge it provides. (The buds last 12 hours on their own; that drops to six with noise reduction.)\n\nThis is admittedly a niche kind of earbud. It’s the rare person who would be able to fully replace their AirPods Pro (or any other pair of ANC-enabled buds) with these. However, as someone who likes to keep my wits about me when walking, commuting, or puttering around the house, they’re much more useful than previous iterations of the device.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T03:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T08:39:10.094340"}

For less than $1,000 and a few minutes of assembly, the Lloyd may be a solution for those who want a real flicker. The Lloyd comes in five easy-to-love colors and most resembles the OG Malm Zircon. Made of electroplated steel, metal, and glass, the 31-pound Lloyd stands 3.5 feet tall.\n\nThe Lloyd uses TerraFlame gel fuel, a proprietary blend of isopropanol and ethanol that has a faint eau de Sterno, reminiscent of the times I’ve used my Le Creuset fondue pot. It burns smokeless and is virtually emission-free. The Lloyd does not come with an extended lighter, but it needs one. The first time I lit the Lloyd, I used a match and immediately regretted it. While the TerraFlame gel fuel cans are the same size as a scented candle, I underestimated the risks, as the flame was instant, large, and hot. I bought an extended curved lighter that worked perfectly.\n\nThere’s no denying the cool aesthetic of the Lloyd. It was a true novelty to have a real crackling flame in my apartment—it really brought the room together. I wish there were an option to buy a fake chimney extender to complete the illusion of a real fireplace. I sat on the carpet in front of the fire and planned to use the Lloyd for my next party or date night. There are few things that can instantly do the full ambiance makeover that a fireplace can achieve. My first time using the Lloyd, I didn’t let the gel fuel burn out. Snuffing the flame using the magnetic opener was a challenge. I needed oven mitts and metal tongs, and once I put the top on the canister, I couldn’t detach the magnetic snuffer and needed pressure with the tongs. This is where the glass shield proved an obstacle. It’s also too hot to move.\n\nIt’s worth noting that back in 2011, the US Consumer Safety Commission put out an executive summary about the risks of pourable gel fuel (not used in the Lloyd) for fire features and gel fuel, including the kind that comes in a can with a metal snuffer, similar to the type used in the Lloyd. There was also a recall of gel fuels back in 2011 due to burns and at least two fatalities. At issue was the consumer’s inability to assess risks because the flame seems like a candle and the actual flames are sometimes difficult to see. Most dangerous was the fact that refueling gel into a hot canister can cause an explosion. Explosions also occurred when consumers attempted to snuff out the flame on the cans. There are vapors and flames from the burning of ethanol. And while the summary is over a decade old, Lloyd’s user’s manual has a warning: “fire and explosive hazard, severe burns or death can occur, and never add fuel to a hot device.” And in regard to the TerraFlame, it comes with a Prop 65 warning: “Gel fuel when burning, may expose you to chemicals including carbon monoxide, which can lead to cancer and reproductive harm.” While I tested the Lloyd Modern Gel Fuel Fireplace, the above warnings apply to any fireplace that uses ethanol-based gel fuel.\n\nAnd there is no safe option for refueling. After reading the summary, including the dangers of snuffing the flame of a gel fuel can and the possibility of explosion, I’ve since let the fuel burn out all the way. When the Lloyd’s flame is out, that’s it—show’s over.\n\nA common refrain in the Solo Stove’s own reviews, and I found this to be true as well, is that the cans do not last the full three hours. In fact, one of the flames went out 45 minutes before the last one. A TerraFlame six-pack costs $40, making it a $5-an-hour fire experience. The Lloyd isn’t a practical heat source. While Solo boasts that the Lloyd brings 9,000 Btu of heat, it is primarily for aesthetic purposes. I used the Lloyd in a 250-square-foot room and didn’t feel space-heater-like warmth. And, before you light your Lloyd, you’ll need to open a window.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:03:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T10:35:12.184280"}
{"title": "The 3 Keys to Understanding Trump’s Retro Coup in Venezuela", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/3-keys-understanding-trumps-retro-coup-in-venezuela/", "summary": "This weekend’s invasion was both a throwback to the last century and a new, uniquely Trumpian nightmare—one that’s just beginning.", "content": "Donald Trump is hardly the first US president to look south and conquer. Over the last century, no fewer than a dozen of Trump’s predecessors embraced the belief that democracy and profit in Latin America were only one successful coup d’état away. But the particular strain of imperial ambition that Trump appears to have set loose with this weekend’s raid in Venezuela appears simultaneously to be deeply atavistic and uniquely Trumpian. And it’s one that doesn’t look set to die down anytime soon.\n\nIt took only a few hours, following the US military’s daring seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, for Trump’s rationale to shift from hand-waving about democracy and fighting narcotics toward taking control of that nation’s vast oil reserves. “We’re in charge,” Trump told reporters. “We’re going to run everything. We’re going to run it—fix it.” And even before Maduro appeared in a New York City courtroom Monday, Trump had begun to celebrate what he’s calling his “Donroe Doctrine,” explicitly threatening a half-dozen other nations, from Colombia and Cuba to Mexico and Denmark’s Greenland, in a talk with reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nNicolás Maduro in handcuffs after landing on a Manhattan helipad, escorted by federal agents en route to a New York federal courthouse on January 5, 2026. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nAs much as it may seem like we’re heading into a new, dangerous, and destabilizing period of Donald Trump’s authoritarian regime—his actions in Venezuela appear illegal under both international law and US law and happened without any congressional consultation—it’s important to recognize and understand some context. The history of the region—and, more importantly, of how Donald Trump himself operates, how he seems caught in the mindset of 1980s America—make clear that Trump may be embarking on what may someday be viewed as the last war of the 20th century. In fact, there are three main principles that help explain where the US finds itself just days into a new year—principles that make clear how, despite how shocking Saturday morning’s breaking news alerts turned out to be, this moment is actually quite unsurprising:\n\n1. The US is good at coups, bad at what follows.\n\nFor a century, the two chief hallmarks of US meddling in Latin America have been short-term tactical military success and long-term strategic failure. These two themes are, in fact, deep, venal strands of America’s political DNA. Case in point: Long, long before he was indicted for his role in the Watergate burglary and meddling in the 1972 presidential election, E. Howard Hunt spent his career as one of the CIA’s best overthrowers of governments.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the powerful United Fruit Company feared the land reforms Guatemala’s democratically elected Jacobo Árbenz might implement and convinced the Truman and Eisenhower administrations that the new Central American leader might embrace communism. The CIA, founded in 1947, was relatively new to the business of meddling in Central and South America, but the US certainly was not—among other expeditions, it had occupied Nicaragua on and off from 1912 to 1933, invaded and occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934, and occupied Cuba from 1906 to 1909 and then returned from 1917 to 1922, to protect US-owned sugar plantations.\n\nHunt was a decidedly middling spy, stationed in Mexico City—where he’d helped recruit another would-be junior officer, William F. Buckley, Jr.—but his career got a big boost when he helped lay the groundwork for overthrowing Árbenz. “What we wanted to do was to have a terror campaign to terrify Arbenz particularly, to terrify his troops,” Hunt said, decades later. It was one of the only successful CIA-backed coups of the 1950s, so Hunt was a natural to include when the agency began planning the Bay of Pigs invasion.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T10:35:12.522077"}

Over the past couple of days posts on Reddit, Hacker News, and X have claimed Microsoft has rebranded Microsoft Office to Microsoft 365 Copilot. As much as Microsoft loves to shove its Copilot branding everywhere, Office hasn’t been renamed to “Microsoft 365 Copilot app.”\n\nThe confusion comes from Microsoft’s own Office.com domain, which for the past year has acted as a way to push businesses and consumers to use the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. This app is a hub app that provides access to Copilot, as well as all the Office apps. Microsoft used to call this app simply Office, before the company rebranded Office to Microsoft 365 in 2022.\n\nIf you visit Office.com you’ll see a big welcome to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, and a note from Microsoft that would confuse anyone not following the company’s confusing branding: “The Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)…”\n\nMicrosoft’s confusing message on its Office website. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\nThat mention of “formerly Office” is Microsoft referring to the very old Office app that launched in 2019 as a way to try and convince people to use online versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Until a year ago it used to be called the Microsoft 365 app. Microsoft then announced it was rebranding its Microsoft 365 app in November 2024 to a Copilot one, which I and everyone else were very confused at. The new app icon and name — Microsoft 365 Copilot — then rolled out on January 15th last year to Windows, iOS, and Android users.\n\nI’m not sure why the internet has only just discovered these changes a year later, but the actual suite of Office apps is still a subscription plan called Microsoft 365. Nothing has changed with this branding since 2022. Heck, if you want to be even more confused by Microsoft’s branding choices then you can go ahead and purchase Microsoft Office 2024, a standalone version of the Office suite without all the cloud features and latest updates you get with a Microsoft 365 subscription.\n\nI asked Microsoft to comment on the confusion around its Office and Microsoft 365 Copilot branding, but the company refused to provide an on the record statement.\n\nNow that you’re up with all of Microsoft’s latest Office branding, I’m sure it won’t be long until the company rebrands Copilot again in the most Microsoft way possible.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T05:48:29-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T10:57:45.473824"}
{"title": "13 Best Tablets (2026), Tested and Reviewed", "link": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-tablets/", "summary": "We’ve tested all the top slates, from Apple’s iPads to Android and Windows devices, and rounded up our favorites.", "content": "Other Tablets to Consider\n\nWe test tons of tablets every year. Here are a few others we like, just not as much as our picks above.\n\nApple iPad Pro (M4). Photograph: Brenda Stolyar\n\nApple iPad Pro (M4, 2024) for $899: Save yourself some cash and buy the 2024 iPad Pro instead of the latest model. Just make sure you actually buy it at a decent discount. There are two size options—11 or 13 inches—and both are insanely thin and light, enhanced by brilliantly bright OLED displays with 120-Hz refresh rates. They're the only iPad models with Face ID for authentication, and sport the nano-texture glass add-on to reduce glare—a must-have for anyone frequently using an iPad outside or near a window. They offer MacBook-level performance thanks to the M4 chipset, and you can take advantage of the new multitasking features in iPadOS 26.\n\nLenovo Idea Tab Pro for $328: I've seen discounts on the Lenovo Idea Tab Pro that drop it as low as $280, and I suggest you only snag it if it dips under $300. I used this large tablet on a trip to London for entertainment and to edit my RAW photos from my Nikon via Adobe Lightroom, and it did the job without a hitch. The 3K resolution on the 12.7-inch LCD is sharp, the speakers are rich, and I didn't notice any problems with performance. It can feel a little unwieldy to hold, but that comes with the territory of a nearly 13-inch tablet. The included stylus helps, especially for smaller touch targets in apps like Lightroom. The only problem? Lackluster software updates. My test unit ran Android 15 at the time, but this tablet supposedly shipped with Android 14 at launch, meaning it will not receive Android version upgrades after Android 16. That'll make it feel a little out of date soon. At least you'll get four years of security updates.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 series. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Series for $900: Samsung's previous-gen Galaxy Tab S10 series consists of the Tab S10+ and Tab S10 Ultra—but Samsung unveiled the Tab S10 FE and Tab S10 FE+ in 2025, lower-cost versions that start at $500, as well as the Tab S10 Lite ($320). I haven't tested the cheaper models yet. I did test the Galaxy Tab S10+ and S10 Ultra, and both are on the bigger end of tablet sizes. They're hard not to like—they perform exceptionally well, have multi-day battery life, promise long software support, and the displays are vibrant, smooth, and sharp. If the Tab S11 series is too pricey, this is an easy way to save and still get a very powerful Android tablet; they're really not that different from the latest models.\n\nBoost Celero 5G Tab. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nBoost Celero 5G Tab for $200: I didn't particularly love using the 10.95-inch Boost Celero 5G Tab—performance can be stuttery, making it a little annoying to operate—but it's $200 and perfectly fine for entertainment, whether that's playing some very lightweight games or catching up on Netflix. You can only buy it on Boost, meaning you might be able to get it for even less if you bundle it with your Boost data plan. Since it has 5G, you can add a cellular plan for always-on connectivity. That's really this tablet's calling card, because you'll be hard-pressed to find a cheap tablet with built-in cellular radios. If you don't want to have to connect to Wi-Fi or tether from your phone, the Celero is a decent option, especially considering the cheapest iPad with cellular will still set you back more than $400.\n\nLenovo Tab Plus. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nLenovo Tab Plus for $240: There are a lot of cheap Android tablets on the internet, and I urge you to be careful with what you buy. If Amazon's Fire tablets don't interest you (see below), consider Lenovo's Tab Plus. I used it for a month for pure entertainment. The 11.5-inch screen is nice and big compared to a phone screen, yet it's portable enough for travel. The built-in kickstand is excellent and should be standard on all tablets. It's not the snappiest, but the performance was more than adequate. While the software is largely fine, on rare occasions, a few preinstalled apps caused full-screen ads to pop up on the screen (one was for “virus protection”). It's crazy that Lenovo would allow that kind of garbage to show up, but the easy fix is to uninstall all the bloatware.\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet. Photograph: Nena Farrell\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet With Dock for $399: Google's Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is part tablet, part smart display. This 11-inch slate is like a big Pixel phone, with a sharp LCD screen, good speakers, and slick software. It runs pretty well thanks to the Tensor G2 processor inside. However, it comes with a hub, so when you're done using it as a tablet, you can magnetically dock it to start recharging automatically. This hub doubles as a speaker, and since the Pixel Tablet is the first tablet to support Google's Cast technology natively, you can cast music or shows to it from your phone or laptop, resulting in better sound quality from the system. When you're not using it, you can turn the display into a screensaver of the Google Home Hub panel, allowing you to see and control your smart home devices at any moment. It features multi-user support with up to eight profiles, so every family member can switch to a personalized profile, securely locked via fingerprint. I don't think it's worth the MSRP anymore, so try to catch it on sale.\n\nHonor MagicPad 2 for £360: This classy tablet is not sold in the US. Quite similar to the OnePlus Pad 2 we recommend above, it boasts a truly gorgeous OLED display with impressive specs (3K resolution, 1,600 nits, 144-Hz refresh rate) that are generally unavailable at this price. Paired with the eight speakers, watching movies and gaming on this tablet is a pleasure. The stylus and keyboard are great (I love the handwriting and formula recognition), but they don’t seem to be available in the UK. I found Honor’s AI features, like Magic Portal, which gets good at predicting what you want to do, very useful, maybe more so on a tablet than a phone. Battery life is good, and charging is speedy (66 watts). The only real weakness here is the limited processing power, which can’t match something like an iPad (though you will pay a lot more for an equivalent Apple device). —Simon Hill\n\nTablet Accessories\n\nSatechi Aluminum Desktop Stand. Courtesy of Satechi\n\nTablets often don't come with kickstands or enough ports, so it's a good idea to snag a few accessories to enhance your experience. These are some of our favorite tablet accessories, many of which you can also find in our Best iPad Accessories guide.\n\nSatechi Aluminum Desktop Stand for $40: This is my favorite tablet stand, so much so that I've taken it with me on trips. It packs down relatively well, and it is very stable—there's no wobbling around here. You can also adjust the angle quite a bit. It can handle huge sizes too—it worked perfectly with my 12.9-inch iPad Pro.\n\nStayGo Mini. Courtesy of Twelve South\n\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub for $60: This works with iPads and other tablets just fine. You can either plug it in and keep it flush with the edge of a slate or use the included cord to keep it extended. You get a USB-C port you can use for pass-through charging, a USB-A, an HDMI, and a headphone jack.\n\nLamicall Gooseneck Tablet Holder for $21: I've used this on my bed frame to hold up various tablets for more than a year. The gooseneck requires a bit of finagling to get to the right position, and if you're constantly tapping the tablet, it will jiggle around. But it's a great hands-free way to watch movies. You can affix the clamp to any surface, like a desk or kitchen counter.\n\nTwelve South HoverBar Duo Mount/Stand for $80: You can use this as a stand or as an arm mount, and Twelve South makes it really easy to switch between the two. That means you can easily affix your tablet to your bedside arm mount and then put it on the stand in your home office in the morning. Both are sturdy, and the arm mount is decently adjustable. Best of all, it doesn't wiggle around as much as the Lamicall above when you tap the screen.\n\nAnker Nano 3 30-Watt Charging Adapter for $17: Most tablets charge at around 18 watts, so this 30-watt charger from Anker is more than capable. The plugs fold up, and it's pretty compact.\n\nAnker Laptop Power Bank for $120: This flight-approved power bank has a massive 25,000-mAh capacity, which should be enough to recharge most tablets twice, or larger tablets once. It dishes out up to 165 watts, meaning it has plenty of power to recharge even a laptop. You can fast-charge with the USB-C ports and use the USB-A port on another device. There's a display that shows the battery’s current charge, a built-in retractable USB-C cable, and a second that doubles as a carry loop.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

The smart sensor debuted at CES 2026 and went on sale this week. It costs a relatively affordable $99 and clips inside the basin of any toilet.\n\nWhen you’re ready to do your business, connect the sensor to its companion mobile app using Bluetooth. The sensor collects a sample for testing and uses optical sensors that measure your pee’s specific gravity. An onboard processing unit then uses proprietary algorithms to let you know if you’re hydrated or not. Most importantly, the gadget uses antibacterial components, has antifungal nanotechnology, is designed for more than 1,000 uses, and is fully no-touch.\n\nA Raft of Options\n\nI’ve been spending more time with my toilet lately than I have since I potty trained my kids. I recently tested the Withings U-Scan, which at $380 is a much pricier and more premium-looking urine analysis device. There are two versions: The Nutrio checks for ketone levels, hydration status, and urine acidity (basically, for diabetes), and the Calci checks for calcium content in your urine, which is an early indicator that you may have kidney stones.\n\nLike the smart toilet, the U-Scan opens and uses a cartridge to take samples of the pee. That means it’s not totally waterproof, and you do have to aim when you go, which necessitated some fun and necessary conversations about placement with my husband. Also, you have to take it out of the toilet to clean and charge it when you change the cartridge, which is every month or so. Helpfully, the cartridge replacements come with a pair of rubber gloves.\n\nStill, that’s a much better and safer process than what happens with the Kohler Dekoda, which was also announced last year. It’s basically a toilet bowl camera; it takes pictures of whatever you deposit in your toilet and uses AI to analyze it and give you recommendations on your gut health. Only, it turned out that the end-to-end encrypted camera was not actually end-to-end encrypted. Also, it costs $599.\n\nFloat Your Boat\n\nVivoo’s urine tracker attaches to the basin of nearly any toilet. Courtesy of Vivoo\n\nA little over a decade ago, the idea someone might want to track what is happening in their toilet was so universally gross that Adult Swim parodied the concept. But now, we’re not only tracking our steps and heartbeats but also testing our blood and our spit. The idea of keeping tabs on what’s going into our toilets just doesn’t seem that weird anymore.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T11:45:22.188908"}

But it’s only now that the celebrated writer is putting her own life to paper. In her recently published memoir, Book of Lives, Atwood chronicles everything from her youth in the Canadian wilderness, to her early professional years toiling in relative obscurity, to the various grudges and score settling she’s finally able to undertake freely—since the people involved, she notes, are now largely dead.\n\nOf course, Atwood long ago ascended from being defined merely as a writer. She has become, particularly since her dystopian novel The Handmaid’s Tale experienced a timely resurgence during the first Trump administration, something of a sociocultural and political expert, asked to opine on everything from dictatorships to reproductive rights to social media. Her takes, it must be said, are often very smart and very good. They’re also, as I learned during a lengthy and expansive conversation with Atwood for The Big Interview podcast, still decidedly reassuring: In a 2023 interview with WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs, Atwood said that she was still optimistic about the United States. Despite everything that’s happened thus far during Trump 2.0, she tells me her stance hasn’t changed.\n\nAs a Canadian myself, the child of a writer, and someone who doesn’t believe in god, interviewing Margaret Atwood is probably as close as I’ll get to having a truly religious experience. Atwood was sharp, hilarious, and generous with her time—even leaving her landline phone off the hook when it wouldn’t stop ringing—as we talked about the merits of jumping from gig to gig, the ins and outs of political resistance, doomscrolling, and much, much more. Here’s our conversation.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nKATIE DRUMMOND: Margaret Atwood, welcome to The Big Interview.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD: Thank you very much.\n\nThank you for being here. Now, we always start these conversations with some very quick questions, like a warm-up for your brain. Are you ready?\n\nI'm always ready.\n\nTypewriter or computer?\n\nRight now, computer.\n\nSpiritually though.\n\nSpiritually, typewriter.\n\nPierre Trudeau or Justin Trudeau?\n\nOh, whoa. Woo. What a question. That is very loaded. Do I get a choice of neither?\n\nYes. Neither is an option.\n\nOK.\n\nYou elect neither?\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot elect “neither” because nobody's called that. But I don't belong to a political party and I usually vote on the basis of what the person is likely to do.\n\nFair enough. What is the best and worst part of literary fame?\n\nThe best part of literary fame is you don't have to work for a university and you can't get fired.\n\nLove that.\n\nThe worst part is selfies.\n\nAre you often asked for selfies?\n\nIn very odd places, such as the ladies' washroom. Do I allow selfies? We're not gonna go there because then I'll get just so many more requests for them.\n\nOK. If Gilead took over Canada, which province would rebel first?\n\nQuebec?\n\nI thought you would say Quebec or Alberta.\n\nYeah, either one. I mean, you can have both if you want. I don't know about Alberta. They've had some pretty, um, Gilead signs recently.\n\nYou're not wrong. For those unfamiliar with Albertan politics, I would describe it as the most Texas of the provinces.\n\nBut not very Texas.

Announced at CES 2026, the myQ Secure View 3-in-1 Smart Lock costs $279.99 and uses face detection to automatically lock or unlock your door depending on who’s approaching.\n\nFor this to work, you and your family members must scan your faces inside the myQ app. The lock will then “recognize” your faces, allowing it to automatically unlock when you reach your doorstep. Conversely, it will lock your door and close your garage if its camera captures someone it doesn’t recognize. Chamberlain says the smart lock works with its garage door openers and other accessories, like the myQ Chime, myQ Smart Garage Video Keypad, and its outdoor camera.\n\nImage: Chamberlain\n\nThis feature is only available with a $7.99 per month myQ subscription, as is the case with several other “premium” functionalities. That includes the ability to save and replay videos for up to 30 days, preview notifications, and adjust motion sensitivity, as well as receive notifications that say what triggered an alert, such as a person, animal, vehicle, or package. You don’t need a subscription to receive notifications related to lock access or motion — they just won’t describe what the camera detected.\n\nAlong with face detection, you can unlock the myQ Secure View 3-in-1 Smart Lock using your fingerprint, a PIN, the myQ mobile app, or a physical key. The smart lock connects to Wi-Fi, and Chamberlain claims it can unlock in just two seconds, while offering up to six months of battery life.\n\nImage: Chamberlain\n\nRelated This smart garage door controller is no longer very smart\n\nLike the other products in the myQ ecosystem, you can’t use the lock with some of the most popular smart home platforms, like Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home.

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.\n\nElgato’s Stream Deck has come full circle. Almost eight years after the company picked up the pieces of Art Lebedev’s ambitious Optimus keyboard and went in a different, cheaper direction with the idea, we’re going back to keyboards. Corsair’s Galleon 100 SD, announced at CES 2026, is a wired mechanical keyboard that effectively has a full Stream Deck Plus built into it and then some: 12 customizable buttons, a multi-purpose 5-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and two rotary dials.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Elgato’s Stream Deck DNA has appeared in a Corsair product. I reviewed the Corsair Voyager gaming laptop in 2022, which had uninspiring touch-sensitive buttons that could be configured using Elgato’s software. It was underbaked, but it felt like the start of something that was long overdue, given Corsair acquired Elgato in 2018. The Galleon seems like a remarkable improvement, mostly due to the fact that it’s the full Stream Deck experience, not a distillation. It’s launching January 29th, and you can preorder one now for $349.99.\n\nImage: Corsair\n\nNot to dismiss the Galleon’s chops as a gaming keyboard (it has an 8,000Hz polling rate, hot-swappable PCB that comes with MLX Pulse switches, gasket mounting, and FlashTap simultaneous opposing cardinal direction support, to name a few specs), the marquee feature here is most definitely its Stream Deck integration. Elgato general manager Julian Fest tells The Verge that it uses a bigger, higher-resolution screen behind the keys than Stream Decks that are currently available, and its viewing angles are supposedly better, too.\n\nAs you might have predicted — and perhaps feared — the Galleon is technically two different devices controlled by different software. The left side is controlled by Corsair’s web hub browser tool, while the right side requires Elgato’s Stream Deck software. That won’t always be the case for tweaking some settings, Fest tells me. They’re still working on firmware that will let the Stream Deck side control the keyboard for things like LED color profiles and polling rate. It’s also working with publishers to build native Stream Deck integration into more games beyond Star Citizen and other hardcore simulators, although Corsair sees the Galleon as being the best fit for players of those genres over others.\n\nThe Stream Deck has become a tool that’s ubiquitous among streamers, and it’s increasingly a popular tool for everyday users who simply need to mute or turn off their webcams. Its programmable buttons offer a vast array of use cases thanks to a vibrant marketplace of plug-ins, from launching files or macros to simply popping bubble wrap with former Verge writer Mitchell Clark’s free Stream Deck plug-in.\n\nFest is a power user, unsurprisingly, swiftly using the buttons to queue some Christmas music, swapping to different webcams via OBS, adjusting the brightness of his room’s lighting, then dialing down the volume all while barely moving his fingers. The Stream Deck’s screen is showing the weather and Spotify cover art. It’s a supercharged multifunction station that’s also a keyboard. And, of course, the Stream Deck’s buttons can turn into a numpad, too.\n\nImage: Corsair\n\nDuring the demo, it became clear that this isn’t something that most companies could achieve; the Galleon is a keyboard with an overflowing level of customization, where the software has already been honed for going on eight years. It also may not have happened right now if Corsair didn’t hire Tobias Brinkmann, who founded Mountain keyboards.\n\nOne of that company’s big swings was the Everest Max, a full-size mechanical keyboard that had a detachable numpad complete with four programmable buttons with screens behind them, its own spin on Stream Deck functionality. We liked it in our 2022 review. Fest tells me that he bought one, took it apart, and had it checked for patent infringement. “At that point, I had no idea who Tobias was. Now, a few years later, he’s heading up our gaming business.”\n\n“I’m personally grateful that it took Corsair so long, and they couldn’t get it together,” Brinkmann jokes. “It helps that Julian and I both have German backgrounds, and we kind of like each other. So that makes it easier to do it.”\n\n“I’d still do it if you were an asshole,” Fest adds with a smirk.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:02:52.952532"}

The Ninebot-owned brand announced two new e-bikes — the seemingly conventional-looking Myon, and the low-step, short-tail Muxi — as well as a sharp-looking electric dirt bike called the Xaber 300.\n\nIn previous years, Segway veered toward gimmicky reveals, like goofy self-balancing pods and paintball-shooting go-karts. Last year, the company straightened up with the release of the moto-styled Xyber and the low-step Xafari. This year, the company continued to build out its lineup with three new models, aiming for a broader market and a level of customization that will allow its customers to tailor vehicles to their lifestyle.\n\nThe Myon and Muxi will both be equipped with anti-theft systems, including an all-new Lost Mode that allows owners to remotely disable the e-bike and battery if it’s stolen — an increasingly popular feature among feature-rich e-bikes. There’s also a plethora of real-time health and fitness data, full-color screens, and updated software for “more refined” power assistance.\n\nAnd as we’ve previously reported, Segway will also offer an optional rear-facing radar for $99.99. The RearView Radar system will have a 150-degree field of view, with a range of up to 230 feet in the rear, extending 20 feet wide. The millimeter-wave radar can help alert cyclists to approaching cars, including the direction from which they’re coming and their proximity to the bike.\n\nA new Xiro Dropper seat post senses when riders are slowing to a stop and lowers automatically, allowing them to put both feet down for stability and mount or dismount with ease. The Dropper Post will be available as an add-on for $299.99 soon.\n\nMyon\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11 Image: Segway\n\nThe Myon e-bike is designed for commuter or leisure riders. Available in Class 1 (pedal-assist, no throttle, max speed 20mph), 2 (throttle, max speed 20mph), or 3 (no throttle, max speed 28mph) configurations, the Myon aims to be Segway’s mass-market model with a little something for everyone.\n\nMyon’s motor offers a nominal power of 500W and 85Nm of peak torque. Its 48V / 722Wh battery offers a range of up to 80 miles. With 80mm of front suspension travel, hydraulic disc brakes, and a new proprietary electronic shifting module, the Myon aims for a ride that’s equal parts comfortable and easy to use.\n\nSegway says its take on electronic shifting is designed to feel simple and intuitive. You can shift using easy-to-press “+” and “–” buttons mounted on the handlebars, which control a small servo unit near the rear derailleur. A short, traditional shift cable connects to the derailleur itself. This setup works with most standard rear derailleurs, while keeping the cable run short to reduce wear, stretching, and other maintenance issues. Fine-tuning your shifts is also easy — you can make precise adjustments right in the app, no mechanical experience required.\n\nSegway’s new TurboTuned, meanwhile, makes sure the Myon’s motor and battery are always working at their best. With the new Algorithm 2.0, everything stays in sync so power delivery feels smooth and effortless. A network of precise sensors detects how hard you’re pedaling, your cadence, and the terrain, then adjusts power in real time to match your ride.\n\nThe bike comes with a low-step frame, though an optional removable top tube is available for $99.99. But if you want to take the bike as is, without any bells or whistles, it will only cost you $1,999 — which is refreshingly affordable. It’s available for preorder as of January 6th.\n\nMuxi\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 7 Image: Segway\n\nSegway’s next bike is the laid-back beach cruiser Muxi (pronounced “moo-shee”). With its retro styling, curved downtube, and upright riding style, Muxi is designed to be more approachable than Segway’s other e-bikes. And with a bevy of accessories available, such as cargo and passenger-carrying capabilities, the Muxi can be fully kitted out for a variety of use cases.\n\nMuxi is available in Class 1 or Class 2 configurations. It uses a single-speed drivetrain and a direct-drive motor with 750W of nominal power and 80Nm of torque. Segway says that Muxi is built with safety and stability in mind, including smart features such as Hill Start Assist to prevent rolling back on inclines, Hill Descent Control for smoother, more confident downhill riding, and regenerative braking to help boost efficiency and reduce brake wear. It also has a Traction Control System that senses wheel spin and adjusts power to keep you balanced. And like Myon, Segway’s Intelligent Ride System provides extra security and anti-theft capabilities.\n\nMuxi will start at $1,699 when it goes on sale in March 2026.\n\nXaber 300\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 8 Image: Segway\n\nAnd now for something a bit pricier — and a lot faster.\n\nThe Xaber 300 (pronounced “say-ber”) is Segway’s new electric dirt bike, built for extreme off-roading. The company isn’t ready to reveal most of the relevant specs, like power, battery, and range, but we should expect more details later this year when the Xaber 300 goes on sale. (At what price? We’ll have to wait for that too.)\n\nWe do know that it comes with three power modes that match 150, 200, and 300cc bikes. Segway says that means you won’t have to upgrade to a bigger bike as you improve your riding skills. For more experienced riders, a virtual electronic clutch mimics a traditional mechanical clutch, delivering responsive control in off-road conditions.\n\nRiders can fine-tune their grip for different terrain with a selectable Traction Control System, and the companion app lets them set a maximum wheelie angle to help build skills safely. And perhaps most importantly, given the current moral panic around teens on e-bikes, built-in parental controls enable you to set top speed limits and create geofenced riding areas through the app. Whether teens abide by those controls is another matter entirely.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T08:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:02:53.186899"}

Trees are bare, mammals are hibernating, people are bed-rotting. While migratory birds do fly south for the winter, many seed- and insect-eating birds do not, and with leaves off the trees, the winter months are often the best time to watch them.\n\nAs someone who tests smart bird feeders year-round for WIRED, I'm always interested in ways to ensure I'm attracting the largest and most interesting variety of birds to my yard, no matter the season.\n\nFurther, if you received a smart bird feeder for Christmas and your neighborhood flocks haven't discovered it yet, you may be looking for some ways to speed up the process. I talked to some ornithologists to learn how to boost the attractiveness of the average yard during these cold, windy, rainy, and sometimes icy months.\n\nMix Your Menu\n\nThough there may be less diversity of bird species around your area due to some migratory birds having moved on (warblers and tanagers, for instance), many seed and insect eaters find enough locally to sustain them. In my West Coast region, this means chickadees, all kinds of sparrows, and even larger birds like flickers. Both ornithologists I spoke to recommended diversifying feed types in winter to appeal to the widest variety of birds.\n\n“To attract the greatest species diversity to your feeders, offer various types of seeds in various styles of feeders,” says Noah Perlut, ornithologist and professor in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of New England. “Some species prefer eating mealworms from platform feeders, while others prefer suet, and others feed from seed tubes.”\n\nSuet (rendered animal fat, basically—often tallow) is indeed a staple in my own winter bird-feeding setup. It comes in a variety of styles, including balls or cakes. I like to use cakes mixed with hot pepper, which squirrels don't like, set in an inexpensive cage feeder. I've found it attracts a range of insect-eating birds in my area, including woodpeckers, nuthatches, juncos, and chickadees.\n\nI also like feeders that sport dual feed bays, especially if you aren't able to site multiple feeders around your yard due to space or the inability to meet the 5-7-9 rule to deter squirrels. (That's 5 feet off the ground; 7 feet from any structures like fences that could be jumped from; and 9 feet from anything overhanging, like branches.)\n\nMaria Kincaid, head ornithologist at FeatherSnap—whose marquee Scout feeder happens to feature dual feed bays—suggests supplementing regular seed with black-oil sunflower seeds, unsalted peanuts, and mealworms. (Some smart bird feeders come with suet ball holders, while others have them available as an add-on.)\n\nKincaid also recommends specifically using a smart bird feeder in winter, so that you can note which types of food are the most popular. This can help you calibrate your feeding ratios to prevent waste.\n\n“Most songbirds that will visit our feeders in the winter have different diet requirements than they do in the spring,” Kincaid says. “High-fat and high-protein foods are especially important during the winter, as it takes more energy to keep warm in colder temperatures.\"\n\nSharing Shelter\n\nSufficient cover—trees, bushes, shrubs, or even a brush pile—keeps birds feeling safe and happy year-round, but it's especially important from December to March, when less foliage could cause them to feel more exposed or threatened.\n\n“Winter is often the busiest time of the year at bird feeders,” Perlut says. “This increased activity is not necessarily reflective of food scarcity—instead, it is a time of year when songbirds focus on self-care instead of breeding activities.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:07:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:02:53.537900"}

The company started in 1955 as a division of North American Aviation, then became part of Rockwell International until Boeing acquired Rockwell’s aerospace division in 1996. Rocketdyne continually designed and tested large new rocket engines from the 1950s through the 1980s. Since then, Rocketdyne has developed and qualified just one large engine design from scratch—the RS-68—and it retired from service in 2024.\n\nThe rise of the commercial space industry precipitated a steeper decline at Rocketdyne. Boeing sold the Rocketdyne division to Pratt & Whitney in 2005 for $700 million, or approximately $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation. This was the year before SpaceX launched its first rocket, and a few years before NASA wound down the Space Shuttle program.\n\nAlways be closing\n\nWhile Rocketdyne’s ownership merry-go-round kept spinning, the company’s competitors pushed forward.

Ring says Fire Watch will roll out to Neighborhood app users this spring.\n\nThe announcement comes at the one year anniversary of the 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, which leveled entire neighborhoods, caused billions of dollars in damage, killed 30 people in the flames, and led to more than 400 deaths in total.\n\nWatch Duty, which lets users track wildfires and receive minute-by-minute updates about a blaze’s path and perimeter, became something of a lifeline for desperate LA residents looking for timely fire information. The mobile app saw 2.5 million new downloads during the LA fires and was widely hailed as a necessary resource.\n\nOne newfound Watch Duty user was Jamie Siminoff, the founder of Ring. While not at Ring at the time, he later rejoined the company after the Palisades fire burned his garage and parts of the back of his house. The experience of searching for information about where the fire was made him think that the Ring cameras all around him should have helped.\n\n“While I'm in it, I thought, why are we not doing this? And why are we not doing that?” Siminoff says. “A big part of why I wanted to come back was to do things like this with the Ring network and with our Ring customers.”\n\nFire Watch gets its real-time fire alerts from Watch Duty, and the feature notifies Neighbors users if a fire is nearby. There is also a feature to accept “voluntary community contributions” that lets Ring users opt in to sharing shots from their smart-home cameras with Watch Duty.\n\nCourtesy of Ring Courtesy of Ring\n\n“When you go into this mode, you'll get an alert as a Ring customer saying there's a massive fire in your area, basically, and would you like to assist Watch Duty with this?” Siminoff says. “You’re basically opening up your camera for the next 24 hours to donate your data.”\n\nThis is not the first third-party service Watch Duty has partnered with. It currently pulls map and fire perimeter information from official emergency services, then collates and regularly updates the information into an easily digestible feed on its app. Alert Wildfire, a service that powers a network of video cameras to spot fires, allows its videos to be included in Watch Duty’s reported feeds about individual fires.

Chovanec was never close to his stepbrother, who was then CEO of Pixar and Next, but their interactions were always amiable. On one memorable occasion, Jobs took Chovanec into his childhood bedroom—in the house with the famed garage where the first Apple computers were assembled—and fired up an early Macintosh to deliver a personal chronicle of how it was developed.\n\nNow Chovanec, who wound up in possession of much of the contents of that bedroom, has consigned a collection of the ephemera to RR Auction for sale. Items include Jobs’ desk, its drawers filled with Reed College notebooks and work he did for Atari in the mid-’70s; the Bob Dylan 8-track tapes (and one Joan Baez tape) he listened to incessantly; a set of magazines that Jobs’ father kept to commemorate cover stories about his son; Jobs’ annotated horoscope generated by an Atari computer; his copy of How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive; an early Apple poster that hung in the living room of the house; and a dozen bow ties that he wore in high school. Also up for bid: a document Jobs signed related to the sale of his father’s 1984 Ford Ranger pickup.\n\nCourtesy of RR Auction\n\nThe Chovanec contributions are part of a larger collection of items up for bid. The star of the auction is the first check cut by Apple Computer Inc. (The auction house is not revealing the current owner.) Written on March 16, 1976, it predates the partnership agreement that formalized the company’s origin 18 days later. Cosigned by Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 check is written to circuit-board designer Howard Cantin, who did the work for what would become the Apple 1. In a 2012 interview, Cantin said that Jobs actually offered him stock but he preferred a direct payment. So the cofounders paid him through a newly created Wells Fargo bank account with funds that came from the sale of Jobs’ VW bus and Woz’s HP calculator. Now, of course, the company is worth trillions of dollars. Previously, the earliest Apple check up for sale was #2, written on March 19, 1976, to Ramlor Inc., a circuit-board maker. In an August 2023 auction, it sold for $135,261.

{"title": "‘Industry’ Takes on the Age Verification Wars", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/hbo-industry-season-4-age-verification/", "summary": "In the HBO show’s fourth season, Industry proves to be more prescient than it’s ever been.", "content": "When they decided to take on age verification in their latest season, Industry cocreators Konrad Kay and Mickey Down didn’t anticipate the issue would become such a political football.\n\n“It was in the ether of British politics, but it wasn't front and center when we started writing the scripts or shooting it, and then it really flared up as a kind of front-page-of-BBC topic of conversation,” Kay says.\n\nSeason 4 of HBO’s sexy and darkly funny financial drama, premiering Sunday, continues Industry’s expansion beyond the cutthroat world of investment banking into tech, porn, age verification, and politics. As the season begins, there’s fighting amongst the top brass at Tender, a fintech company that’s recently gone public, over whether or not to continue processing payments for Siren, an adult platform akin to OnlyFans. While Siren and other gambling and porn companies make up a good chunk of Tender’s revenue, some Tender executives are spooked by threats of sweeping new age-verification laws and anti-porn rhetoric coming from the UK’s Labour Party and feel there’s more to be gained by cleaning up their act.\n\nIn reality, the UK’s Online Safety Act requiring people to verify their ages before they can view porn and other restricted content, came into effect in July 2025, long after Kay and Down came up with the storyline for Industry’s most recent season. Still, it’s had similar impacts to those felt by Siren. Pornhub’s UK traffic dropped by almost 80 percent in light of the regulations and it’s facing similar challenges in the US, where half of states have enacted age verification laws. In December, members of Congress considered 19 bills aimed at protecting children and teens online, though critics have said some of them are unconstitutional.\n\n“It’s kind of shown how fragile free speech absolutism is,” says Down, describing the “wildly different” opinions on the issue, from puritanism even within liberal enclaves to a censorious “shut everything down” approach from conservatives.\n\nWhile Industry has been a bit of a sleeper hit for HBO, it finally seemed to break through during Season 3, with its viewership for the premiere up 60 percent compared to Season 2’s premiere. Season 4 builds off that momentum very effectively, and feels more prescient than ever.\n\n“We've got the OnlyFans piece and then we've got the fintech piece, and then we've got the fraud piece,” Kay says. But then, “in the back half of the season, we got the ascendant face of authoritarianism in the UK and the US.”\n\nThe new season spends more time with junior banker and part-time OnlyFans model Sweetpea Golightly, who keeps her face out of her adult content, but who nonetheless has her identity exposed without her consent. It’s a more nuanced look at what happens to modern online sex workers, who often get portrayed on TV in far more black-and-white terms.\n\n“She started Season 3 being like, I'm an empowered woman. I have this OnlyFans account. I never leave money on the table. In Season 4, we're looking at what it looks like when that begins to shift,” Down says. “It can be empowering and exploitative.”\n\nIn fact, almost every character in Industry is both empowering and exploitative, depending on the circumstances. And while the latest season is particularly newsy, the most enjoyable part of the show can be watching them peel back those complicated, and often unsavory layers.\n\nLast season followed publishing heiress Yasmin, played by Marisa Abela, as she dealt with the fallout of her Epstein-like father’s disappearance—for which she was arguably partly responsible—and contended with the extent of his abuse.

It can also recognize and identify specific iPhone models dating back to the iPhone 15 — as well as iPad Pro models from 2020 onward — and adjust charging based on power needs. For example, it’ll deliver maximum speeds when a phone is nearly dead, then drop to 15W once a device is above 80 percent.\n\nAdditionally, Anker’s new Nano Charger features a “Care Mode” that can lower charging temperatures overnight with a simple double-tap. The charger’s folding prongs can also rotate 180 degrees, making it easier to plug in at different angles or in tight spaces.

Meanwhile, it's building a digital twin to help dial it in.", "content": "Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year.\n\nThe magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.\n\nAfter decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.\n\nKey components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”\n\nEach magnet weighs 24 tons and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field. Image Credits:Commonwealth Fusion Systems\n\nWhen installed, the D-shaped magnets would sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.\n\nTo hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.\n\nTo work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nThat won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”\n\nCFS is working with Nvidia and Siemens to produce a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor. Image Credits:Commonwealth Fusion Systems\n\nThe hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.\n\nBuilding Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates.\n\nMumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.\n\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T16:37:23.200170"}

Sort of. At CES 2026 this week, Roborock launched the Saros Rover, a robot vacuum with articulating legs on wheels that let it climb a full staircase in order to clean multiple floors and also clean each step along the way.\n\nI saw a live demo of the Rover on the show floor, and it was impressive. Its legs move in a froglike manner, fluidly and with lots of flexibility. It can raise and lower each one independently, do small jumps, and change direction quickly — moving much more smoothly than most robot vacuums.\n\nI’m skeptical this will eliminate the dust bunnies on my stairs, but it’s a big step up\n\nAs for stairs, it climbed them by using its legs to lift its body, then lowering itself onto the step before pivoting on one leg to vacuum along it. It then proceeded to the next step.\n\nThe process was fairly slow, taking just under three minutes to climb five stairs, and there were a few moments where it teetered on the edge of a step and I was sure it was going to tumble backwards — but it didn’t. While I’m skeptical that this will entirely eliminate the dust bunnies in the corners of my stairs, it’s a big step up for sure.\n\nThe Saros also successfully navigated a slope, rolling down it smoothly with control. Roborock said its engine enables it to brake and stop, turn around, and move backward up a slope. In the demo, it also did a small hop, which should let it navigate multi-level room thresholds by jumping over them.\n\nI’m told the Rover can climb down stairs using the same method it does going up, and can also go up and down without vacuuming if you want it to move a bit faster, say, to clean your upstairs rooms.\n\nRoborock says the Rover will be able to climb almost any staircase, including traditional, curved, spiral, and carpeted staircases with bullnose fronts. Although the stairs I saw it demoed on were wide, flat, and straight. All of this combined should mean the Rover can access every room of your house.\n\nThere are no specs or a release date for Rover. But the company says it is a real product in development. Roborock is moving cautiously here following the poorly reviewed Saros Z70, its robot vacuum with an arm. “It will take a while to reach the market,” Ruben Rodriguez of Roborock told The Verge.\n\nAdditionally, the Rover is currently only a vacuum; it doesn’t have a mopping system. “We’re still working out which of our mop systems will work or whether we do a different thing altogether,” said Rodriguez.\n\nThe evolution of the robot vacuum\n\nRoborock’s Rover and Z70 vacuum with an arm did a little dance on the CES show floor. Yes it was slightly terrifying. Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nWe knew this was coming. At CES last year, Roborock and Dreame both debuted vacuums with arms; Dreame’s even had little legs (not staircase-climbing appendages but small propellers that enable it to get over small steps).\n\nThen, at IFA 2025, several companies rolled out stair lifts for robot vacuums. The first vacuum robot that can walk up and down your stairs, while also cleaning them, felt inevitable. It’s impressive, but whether it will be practical and affordable remains to be seen.\n\nRoborock hasn’t given Rover a robotic arm yet, but it’s just a matter of time\n\nWhat’s really remarkable is what this signals. Robot vacuums are evolving faster than ever. From simple disc bots that just sucked up dirt to machines that can pick up clutter, clean more than just your floors, and even climb stairs, they’re becoming more capable.\n\nRoborock hasn’t given Rover a robotic arm yet, but it’s just a matter of time.

Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger.

It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.\n\nAs with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.\n\nIt’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a hidden emoji game in DMs last year. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.\n\nThe internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently expanded its Communities feature with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it added a “disappearing posts” feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.\n\nWhile Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago.

He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nCES 2026 live: all the news, announcements, and innovations from the show floor and beyond\n\nThere was a time not too long ago when buying a power bank was as easy as choosing the cheapest portable battery that could charge your phone and quickly slip into your pocket, purse, or backpack. The hardest part was deciding whether it was time to ditch USB-A ports.\n\nRecently, however, brands have been slathering on features, many of which are superfluous, in an attempt to both stand out from the commodified pack and justify higher price points. It’s especially prevalent amongst the bigger power banks that can also charge laptops, those that butt right up to the “airline friendly” 99Wh (around 27,650mAh) size limit.\n\nAt CES 2026, we’re seeing a trend towards power banks with integrated cables, which is very convenient. But a similar trend to slap large, energy-sapping displays onto these portable batteries is silly. And that’s just the start of the atrocities witnessed in recent months.\n\nEcoFlow’s modular accessories are easy to lose and that big display sucks power, is difficult to navigate, and requires a screensaver. Image: EcoFlow\n\nThe power bank that pushed things over the edge for me is the $270 EcoFlow Rapid Pro X Power Bank 27k that I received for review. Here’s my review: it’s bad. Do. Not. Buy. As a power bank, it tries too hard to do too much, making it too expensive, too big, too slow, and too heavy.\n\nThe snap-on decorative faceplates are ridiculous and the proprietary magnetic modules for its Apple Watch charger and retractable USB-C cable are too easy to misplace.\n\nThe giant display EcoFlow uses scratches easily and is too dim to easily read outdoors. The confusing UX on the Rapid Pro X model is especially offensive in its touch-sensitive clumsiness. Nobody needs a display that takes 30 seconds to wake up from sleep and plays swirly graphics and blinking eyeballs when awake, slowly sapping the power bank’s energy reserves. The fact that it has a screensaver tells me that the product team completely lost the plot.\n\nAnker’s also guilty of putting large displays onto its power banks. Most people don’t need anything more than four dots to show the remaining capacity, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to buy a power bank without an LCD display. In the 20,000mAh range, Anker doesn’t even list a display-less model anymore. I, like many Verge readers, love to see the actually wattage pumping in and out of those ports — but the vast majority of people have no need for that.\n\nAnker’s fast-charging, proprietary dock upsell. Image: Anker\n\nAnker, like EcoFlow, also offers power banks with proprietary pogo-pin connectors, Both companies use those connectors to lure owners into buying expensive desk chargers that don’t work with anything else. Those extra-fast charging speeds are unlikely to justify the premium expense.\n\nMost people, even tech savvy Verge readers, don’t even need a power bank that can output 140W of power delivery over USB-C. The majority of non-gaming laptops require 65W or less. And the primary computing device for most people — the phone — only requires about 20W.\n\nWe certainly don’t need power banks with built-in hotspots when that’s already built into our Android and iOS phones. Baseus made one anyway.\n\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity are becoming a common feature in some flagship power banks. I’m all for remotely monitoring massive power stations used to power off-grid homes and campers, but not a portable power bank that’s charging the phone in your hand or is plugged into a nearby wall jack.\n\nThe phone you’re charging also has a flashlight. Image: Pangootek\n\nWe also don’t need integrated flashlights. Why random Amazon brand, why?\n\nAll these extra “features” just add weight, size, and cost to power banks. They also increase the risk that something will go wrong on a device that’s meant to always be with you and just work when you need it. And power banks don’t need any extra help justifying a recall.\n\nKickstands and integrated cables are useful features I’ll pay extra for. Image: Kuxiu\n\nOne power bank trend I can get behind is integrated cables like the retractable version found on EcoFlow’s Rapid Pro Power Bank 27k (note the lack of “X” in the name). Always having a properly specced cable that matches the device’s max input and output is super convenient. I like that Kuxiu’s S3 MagSafe power bank, for example, neatly wraps the cable around the chassis to plug into a hidden USB-C jack. That way the cable can be replaced if it frays or breaks.\n\nI’m also a fan of adding kickstands to MagSafe power banks that prop phones up at your preferred angle for extended viewing or recording. More importantly, a few companies are now adopting semi-solid state chemistry that makes their power banks less susceptible to thermal runaway, which was an industry plague in 2025. They cost more to buy, but they’re cheaper to own over their extended lifetimes.\n\nSharge’s counter argument to everything I’ve written. Image: Sharge\n\nI can’t help but enjoy the look of Sharge’s Retractable 3-in-1 Power Bank, even though its integrated wall outlet and underwhelming specs for a battery pack of this size and price completely undercuts my entire argument. I’m a sucker for Braun design, forgive me!\n\nBasic power banks like Anker’s PowerCore 10k are a rarity these days. Image: Anker\n\nThe fastest and most powerful power banks with lots of gee-whiz features will often generate headlines for pushing the envelope of what’s possible. But the “best” power bank might not be best for you, when basic affordability is all you really need.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T13:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T18:43:57.980282"}

But he is also an increasingly seasoned angel investor.", "content": "Mario Götze will go down in soccer history as the player who scored the winning goal that made Germany the 2014 FIFA World Cup champion. But he is also an increasingly seasoned angel investor.\n\nCompanion M, Götze’s personal investment vehicle, now has a portfolio of more than 70 companies, two of which became unicorns in 2025 — Danish fintech Flatpay and German AI startup Parloa. But the athlete also learned some lessons along the way about vetting opportunities. “I only agree to invest if the startup and its founders check all the boxes,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nThe boxes can be quite subjective at the stage at which Götze invests — typically pre-seed and seed rounds, with ticket sizes between €25k and €50k ($29k-$58k). To address this, Götze says Companion M “focuses on specific areas where we have built profound network and expertise.” Surprisingly, sports isn’t one of those areas — at least not directly.\n\nAccording to Götze, Companion M primarily focuses on B2B SaaS, software infrastructure and cybersecurity, as well as health and biotech. While that’s not sports tech per se, health and biotech are a natural niche for an athlete interested in human performance and wellness — and who has the freedom to pursue unconventional opportunities in those fields.\n\nIn 2020, Götze made headlines for investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group when most European institutional investors wouldn’t touch cannabis with a ten-foot pole. Since then, Germany has liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed a 10% share of the German medical cannabis market in 2024.\n\nWith cannabis still forbidden for athletes in competition, Götze will have to wait to try the stuff himself: the 33-year-old is still playing professionally at the top league level with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion Kevin Durant.\n\nGötze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé also do. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don’t have away games or play Champions League,” Götze wrote.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he explained.\n\nThere is an undeniable branding aspect to these efforts. When Götze became Revolut’s first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company cited his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he describes as “another passion apart from sport.”\n\nThis passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher.\n\nNot coincidentally, Götze mostly invests in Europe and in the U.S., with past investments including Miami-based Arcee AI and Frankfurt-based Qualifyze. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and it he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based KoRo.\n\nExits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he’s also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion backed more than 20 venture capital firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund.\n\nGötze is still under contract with his club and is reportedly discussing an extension. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. “After my career ends, I plan to focus on my investment activities,” he told Bloomberg. But even then, don’t expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.\n\n“There are plenty of new startups every year, and there will be some that you miss out on. But regretting past decisions leads to making uneducated or impulsive decisions in the future,” he told TechCrunch. Spoken like a true sportsman: dwelling on what you missed won’t help you score the next goal.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:18:02 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T18:43:58.446837"}

These funds, termed indirect costs, are awarded when researchers at an institution receive a grant. They cover costs that aren’t directly associated with the research project, such as utilities, facilities for research animals, and building maintenance.\n\nPreviously, these costs had been the subject of negotiations and audits, with indirect cost rates for universities in more expensive locations exceeding half the value of the grants awarded. The Trump administration wanted to cut this to a flat rate of 15 percent for everyone, which would be crippling for many universities.\n\nA number of states, later joined by organizations representing a broad array of universities and medical schools, immediately sued to block the policy change. A district court temporarily blocked the new policy from being implemented and later issued a permanent injunction. The government appealed that decision, but on Monday, an appeals court rejected the effort because the first Trump administration had attempted the same move before—and Congress passed a rule to block it. Indirect research funding will remain intact unless the Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nDon’t try that again\n\nUniversities rely on indirect costs to cover everything from building and maintaining dedicated lab space to paying the staff who pick up trash and dispose of hazardous waste. Their costs vary from location to location; universities in dense urban areas, for example, have to pay more for buildings and pay their staff higher salaries. So the NIH has created a formula for universities to estimate their research costs, which serves as the starting point for negotiations. Once the rate is set, audits can be conducted at any time to ensure that the actual costs are consistent with the rate and that funds are spent appropriately.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:05:05 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T18:43:58.824442"}

Sometimes, AI just wants to be your friend. And while robot pets weren’t the biggest stars of CES 2026, they’ve become more than just noise and are signaling how AI is apparently leaving our screens and taking on a physical presence in our lives.\n\nBut not every robot at CES seems that interested in having a job. Away from the big demos and flashy promises of automation, a quieter trend is taking shape: machines designed for little purpose beyond existing. And they’re everywhere.\n\nIf you ever get bored charging your phone, Loona’s DeskMate offers a solution: it transforms your iPhone into a cutesy companion with oversized, Pixar-like eyes that track you as you talk. It has practical features too, like Slack integration and meeting assistance, but as a selling point they feel almost incidental to the companion experience. The company says the tool is powered by AI, though it does not say how.\n\nPuppy dog eyes… sort of. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nSpeaking of Pixar, AI robotics startup Zeroth wants to sell you a real-life WALL-E companion, or, in markets like the US where it lacks the Disney license, something close to WALL-E’s weird, off-brand cousin. The robot, called W1, doesn’t really do much besides follow you around, carrying small items, or snapping a few pictures. The company says W1 is built on “advanced mobility and environmental AI,” though details are vague.\n\nWALL-E’s cousin? Image: Zeroth Zeroth’s WALL-E is only available in China at the moment. Image: Zeroth\n\nZeroth is also bringing a doll-sized humanoid robot, M1, to the US, an at-home companion that blends utility — reminders, childcare assistance, fall detection — with companionship, making use of Google’s Gemini AI model for conversations. That combination has already secured an audience for social robots popular in parts of Asia, particularly in China and South Korea, where the robots are popular with children and the elderly. CES 2026 suggests this concept is now being deliberately repackaged and marketed for Western homes.\n\nAn at-home companion. Image: Zeroth\n\nOthers leaned even more explicitly into emotional companionship. In other words: robot pets. There’s Fuzozo, a puffball that purrs when you pet it and can recognize its owner. Unlike many housebound AI devices, it has a cellular connection, allowing it to be carried around with you, a hint at how ubiquitous these products might be in the future, even if it’s unclear how precisely AI is being used.\n\nPortable puffs.

It says the emotional companion robot, LilMilo, uses AI and “lifelike biometrics” to recognize voices, develop a personality, and adapt to user habits. As with other products, details on the AI element inside LilMilo are generic and nondescript.

That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.\n\nBut Stein found that Wang appropriately weighed ChatGPT users’ privacy interests when ordering OpenAI to produce the logs. For example, to shield ChatGPT users, the total number of logs shared was substantially reduced from tens of billions to 20 million, he wrote, and OpenAI has stripped all identifying information from any chats that will be shared.\n\nStein further agreed that news plaintiffs needed access to the entire sample because, as Wang wrote, even “output logs that do not contain reproductions of News Plaintiffs’ works may still be relevant to OpenAI’s fair use defense.”\n\nAlthough OpenAI argued that Wang should have approved the “least burdensome” path to users’ privacy, the AI company cited no case-law to support that argument, Stein wrote, nor its claims that Wang owed them any explanation for rejecting that path.\n\n“Judge Wang’s failure to explain explicitly why she rejected OpenAI’s search term proposal is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law given that she adequately explained her reasons for ordering production of the entirety of the 20 million de-identified log sample,” Stein wrote, affirming Wang’s order.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:59:21 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T19:00:25.222791"}
{"title": "The best laptop deals you can get right now", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/23161948/apple-macbook-lenovo-acer-deal-sale", "summary": "If you want a great laptop, you’re going to have to fork over a ton of money, right? Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points, with even more coming in 2026. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better [&#8230;]", "content": "If you want a great laptop, you’re going to have to fork over a ton of money, right? Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points, with even more coming in 2026. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better suited for, say, college students, whereas others are ideal for gamers).\n\nThat’s why we’ve come up with this list of some of the best laptop deals available right now. In addition to the discounts listed below, we’ve noted each model’s best features (and downsides), providing you with more clarity during your shopping journey.\n\nMacBook deals\n\nApple itself no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 — and hasn’t for years — but you can still get this solid laptop for $599.99 ($50 off) at Walmart. The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable of handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.\n\nThe laptop’s battery lasted between eight and 10 hours when we originally reviewed it, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time, and port selection is also more limited than in newer models.\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 remains Apple’s latest thin and lightweight laptop, and it’s our top pick in The Verge’s guide to the best laptops right now. It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files.\n\nApple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine.\n\nYou can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for $799 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. If you need a larger screen, you can get the 15-inch MacBook Air with the same specs for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\n\nIt’s getting tough to find the M4 version of Apple’s MacBook Pro in stock, but that’s not a major concern to us because its M5 starter model is getting more affordable as the months go on. Buying the entry-level MacBook Pro still gets you a pretty serious machine, with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It debuted for $1,599, but you can currently snag one at $1,449, a $150 discount, from Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The year-over-year improvements in the M5 model don’t make it a worthy upgrade for M4 and M3-equipped laptop owners, and it has almost no new design features. That said, it’s still a great laptop if you need something more powerful than a MacBook Air.\n\nThe M4 generation MacBook Pros are some of Apple’s fastest laptops to date. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality.\n\nThe M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch.\n\nIf you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which runs on a current-generation M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an external SSD with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also opt for the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro and a 16-inch screen if you prefer working on a larger display.\n\nRight now, the 14-inch M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon. The 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 14-core CPU, and a 20-core GPU is currently on sale for around $2,239 ($260 off) at Amazon.\n\nAsus laptop deals\n\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14\n\nAsus’ Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop we’ve tested recently because of its mix of power and portability. It has a 14-inch 120Hz OLED display with a 2880 x 1800 resolution. It retains the design Asus introduced last year, but received some nice spec bumps. The entry-level model comes with 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor, and an Nvidia RTX 5060 chip with 8GB of video RAM. The G14 can be specced up with a faster processor, more storage, additional memory, and an Nvidia RTX 5080 if you want a little more oomph.\n\nThe G14 has a comfortable backlit keyboard with bigger keycaps, a large trackpad, and you can charge the laptop via a USB-C port on either side. You’ll still need to use Asus’ proprietary charger to get the fastest charging speed. We chose it as the best 14-inch gaming laptop because we could play new games on high settings, though doing so would kick up the fan and make the laptop feel warm. When it gets hot, the Zephyrus G14 throttles the GPU to avoid overheating, which will reduce its gaming performance.\n\nThe laptop weighs 3.31 pounds, a little over half a pound more than the MacBook Air with M4, which proves you don’t have to carry around a massive machine just to play games on the go. The Zephyrus G14 also features an HDMI 2.1 port to connect it to a 4K 120Hz monitor or TV. Right now, you can get the entry-level G14 on sale for $1,719.99 ($80 off) at Best Buy.\n\nThe Flow Z13 is a convertible gaming laptop that offers impressive performance given its slim profile and integrated graphics card, which earned it a spot in our best gaming laptops guide. It runs on AMD’s Ryzen AI Max 395 processor, has 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, and has a 13.4-inch 180Hz IPS touchscreen display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600. It doesn’t have a dedicated graphics card like our other gaming laptop recommendations, but its 40-core Radeon 8060S graphics chip rivals the performance of Nvidia’s RTX 4060 card in our benchmarks.\n\nThat’s especially impressive given the fact that the Flow Z13 can be detached from its keyboard and used as a Windows tablet. Its built-in kickstand makes it easy to prop up on a table without a keyboard. The laptop weighs 3.5 pounds with the keyboard attached (2.65 pounds on its own), and is .59 inches thick with the keyboard (.51 inches without). It’s equipped with two USB 4 (Type-C) ports with Power Delivery, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type-A) port, an HDMI 2.1 port, 3.5mm combo audio jack, and a microSD card slot (UHS-II).\n\nIn our tests the laptop could play Cyberpunk 2077 at up to 70 frames per second at high settings with FSR3 and frame generation enabled, and Elden Ring ran at around 50fps on the high graphics setting at the laptop’s native resolution. Elden Ring played at up to 60fps when we lowered the resolution to 1200p. Playing Elden Ring drained the Z13’s battery in about 90 minutes, but it lasted 10 hours in our battery rundown test and provided between nine and 10 hours of regular use in power efficiency mode with the battery saver feature enabled. The laptop is currently on sale for its all-time low of $2,169 ($130 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Read our review.\n\nLenovo laptop deals\n\nA dual-screen laptop is admittedly pretty niche, but we chose Lenovo’s Yoga Book 9i is the best of the bunch in our best laptops guide. It runs on Intel’s Core Ultra 7 155U processor, and comes with 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and integrated Intel UHD graphics chip. Its key feature is the pair of 13.3-inch 60Hz OLED touchscreen displays, which each have a 2880 x 1800 resolution. The screens have a clamshell design and are attached by a hinge, so the Yoga Book 9i looks like a typical laptop when opened.\n\nYou can use the laptop in a few configurations. In clamshell mode, the bottom screen displays a full-sized virtual keyboard with trackpad to give you a traditional laptop experience. Our experience in this mode was mixed because it’s too easy to accidentally minimize apps, or make typos if you’re used to the tactile feel of a physical keyboard.\n\nYou can attach the Yoga Book 9i to the included keyboard folio, which props it up and allows you to use both screens independently like a laptop attached to an external monitor (except, in the Yoga Book 9i’s case, they’re built-in). One screen can be folded completely over the other display to use the laptop like a large-screen tablet, or folded partially to prop one screen up if you want to watch a movie at a more comfortable angle.\n\nDuring our testing, the Yoga Book 9i was difficult to use on a lap with the included Bluetooth keyboard because it would shift around while being used. However, moving apps from one display to another using touch gestures was intuitive thanks to tutorials in the User Center app, which immediately launch upon the first boot. The software also lets you enable and disable gestures, if you find some confusing or unnecessary. Switching from a traditional laptop to a dual-screen model will likely take an adjustment period, so it’s very helpful that Lenovo designed software to help ease you through the transition.\n\nDespite having two screens, the Yoga Book 9i only weighs 2.95 pounds, which was light enough to carry in a backpack without weighing us down. The keyboard folio adds some bulk, but comes with an attached elastic band to keep the laptop and accessory from getting detached while you travel. If you’re dedicated to the dual-screen lifestyle, or you want to give it a try, the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is on sale for $1879.99 ($120 off) at Best Buy.\n\nRazer laptop deals\n\nThe Razer Blade 16 is one of our favorite 16-inch gaming laptops, and multiple configurations of the machine are currently on sale. Every 2025 model has a 16-inch OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 2560 x 1600 resolution. From there you can choose a machine with the mix of CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage options that’s right for your budget. However, only two models of the Razer Blade 16 are currently on sale.\n\nThe first is its entry-level configuration with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor, Nvidia’s RTX 5060 graphics card with 8GB of video memory, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, which you can get for $2,199.99 ($200 off) from Razer. For a more powerful option with an RTX 5070 graphics card, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, that’s $2,599.99 ($200 off) now from Razer. Power differences aside, both laptops are equipped with three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A ports, two USB4 ports, a UHS-II SD card reader, HDMI 2.1 port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and proprietary charging port.\n\nWe tested the highest-end configuration of the laptop, which has an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU. That model isn’t on sale and typically retails for $4,499, but we also recommend the more affordable configurations to anyone who wants to play PC games on the go. One of the typical tradeoffs when getting a high-end gaming laptop is thickness and weight, but the Razer Blade 16 is surprisingly slender at 4.6 pounds and .69 inches thick at its thickest point.\n\nRazer even managed to fit in a 1080p webcam that looks good and six-speaker audio system into the laptop’s thin chassis. Non-gaming features, like the Razer Blade 16’s large trackpad and keyboard were a cut above what we’d expect from a gaming laptop.\n\nThe laptop’s battery lasted about an hour and a half playing Cyberpunk 2077 and around two hours when playing Elden Ring, so you’ll be able to play games for a bit without plugging it in. However, we needed to turn down both game’s graphics settings to achieve that longevity. We also tested the Razer Blade 16 for creative tasks, and lightly editing roughly 1,000 images in Adobe Lightroom, which took about an hour and drained 25 percent of the laptop’s battery. Read our review.\n\nRelated Razer is making computers for AI developers now\n\nHP laptop deals\n\nHP’s Victus 15 is our top pick for a budget-friendly gaming laptop, and a good choice if you want a laptop with a little more graphical oomph for well under $1,000 on sale. It’s powered by an Intel Core i5-1342H processor and has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It has an 144Hz 1080p screen and Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card with 6GB of dedicated video memory, which shine when playing live service games like Minecraft and Fortnite. You should also be able to play more graphically-demanding games at lower graphics settings. HP equipped the laptop with an HDMI port, one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, an ethernet port, and a headphone jack.\n\nThe laptop doesn’t have a touchscreen, and our reviewer wasn’t a fan of its display’s 16:9 aspect ratio (it’s easy to get spoiled with 16:10 these days), but its negative qualities are easier to accept when the laptop is $631 ($429 off) at Walmart. Having a machine with a respectable dedicated GPU along for under $600 is impressive. The laptop is also capable of handling day-to-day tasks like streaming videos, putting together slideshows, spreadsheets, and documents, and video chatting with friends and colleagues.\n\nUpdate, January 6th: Updated pricing / availability and added a deal for Apple’s latest MacBook Pro.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T14:20:42-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T19:27:11.419764"}

HSI began investigating pcTattletale in mid-2021 as part of a wider probe into the industry of consumer-grade surveillance software, also known as “stalkerware.”\n\nThis is the first successful U.S. federal prosecution of a stalkerware operator in more than a decade, following the 2014 indictment and subsequent guilty plea of the creator of a phone surveillance app called StealthGenie. Fleming’s conviction could pave the way for further federal investigations and prosecutions against those operating spyware, but also those who simply advertise and sell covert surveillance software.\n\nHSI said that pcTattletale is one of several stalkerware websites under investigation.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch, nor did a representative for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, which brought the charges against Fleming.\n\nFleming’s lawyer Marcus Bourassa did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\npcTattletale was a remote surveillance app that had been under Fleming’s control since at least 2016. Stalkerware apps like pcTattletale allow ordinary consumers to buy software capable of tracking people and their data without their knowledge, including romantic partners and spouses, which is illegal in the United States and many other countries.\n\nOnce physically planted on a person’s phone or computer (usually with knowledge of the victim’s passcode or login), the app would continuously upload a copy of the victim’s information, including messages, photos and location data, to pcTattletale’s servers and make the data accessible to whoever planted the spyware.\n\nFleming shut down pcTattletale in 2024 following a data breach, which saw a hacker deface the company’s website and steal reams of data from its servers, including identifiable information belonging to its customers and their victims. More than 138,000 customers who had signed up to use pcTattletale had their breached information shared with data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned.\n\nAt the time, Fleming told TechCrunch that his company was “out of business and completely done,” after deleting the contents of pcTattletale’s servers.\n\nDespite the shutdown, federal agents were already far into their investigation of Fleming’s illegal spyware business.\n\nFeds search founder’s $1.2M home\n\nHSI began investigating pcTattletale in June 2021 after finding over a hundred stalkerware websites offering surveillance products, many of which advertised lawful uses of the software, such as monitoring children or employees.\n\npcTattletale stood out because it was specifically advertising its spyware for “surreptitiously spying on spouses and partners,” wrote HSI special agent Nick Jones in the 2022 affidavit in support of a search warrant for Fleming’s home. The affidavit was unsealed in early December 2025 ahead of Fleming’s anticipated plea hearing.\n\nCrucially for investigators, Fleming was believed to be operating pcTattletale from his home in Bruce Township, Michigan, well within reach of U.S. law enforcement — unlike many overseas stalkerware operators who are not.\n\nUnlike some stalkerware operators who shield their identities to avoid legal and reputational risks from working with spyware, Fleming was brazen in how he advertised pcTattletale. In videos posted on YouTube, Fleming could be seen at his home promoting pcTattletale as its creator and founder.\n\nA surveillance photo taken by HSI agents outside of Bryan Fleming’s home in Michigan.

HSI said the emails showed that Fleming “knowingly assisted customers seeking to spy on nonconsenting, non-employee adults.”\n\nFederal agents later surveilled Fleming’s home to confirm it was in fact him.\n\nJones also went undercover to collect evidence, posing as an affiliate marketer under the guise of promoting the spyware in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. As a result of this operation, Jones exchanged emails with Fleming, in which the pcTattletale founder provided images intended for banner ads that promoted the spyware as a way to “catch a cheater,” which made it clear Fleming wanted to market his product for illegal purposes.\n\nBy November 2022, HSI had obtained permission from a U.S. judge to search Fleming’s home, which agents raided soon after, seizing an unknown number of items. Agents also obtained records associated with Fleming’s bank and his PayPal account, which had transactions totaling more than $600,000 as of the end of 2021.\n\nThe search warrant was filed under seal amid concerns that Fleming could destroy or tamper with evidence. Fleming has since sold the house for $1.2 million, per public records.\n\nFleming’s conviction is a win for privacy advocates and campaigners who work to counter the proliferation of stalkerware and raise awareness to its dangers.\n\nEva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the co-founder of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, who has investigated and fought stalkerware for years, commented on Fleming’s guilty plea when reached by TechCrunch.\n\n“One of the most striking aspects of this case is the extent to which stalkware companies like pcTattletale operate out in the open,” said Galperin. “This is because the people behind these companies so rarely face consequences for selling tools that they themselves say are explicitly for monitoring other people’s devices without their knowledge or consent.”\n\n“I hope that this case changes the risk calculus for makers of stalkerware,” said Galperin.\n\nFleming is expected to be sentenced later this year.\n\n——\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

Nvidia's new Vera Rubin architecture was launched earlier than expected at CES, joined by announcements for its own Tesla-rivaling self-driving car technology, and the latest updates coming to DLSS, G-Sync display tech, [&#8230;]", "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nCES 2026 live: all the news, announcements, and innovations from the show floor and beyond\n\nWe’re not even a full week into 2026 yet, but Nvidia has already announced several products and updates to start the new year. Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin architecture was launched earlier than expected at CES, joined by announcements for its own Tesla-rivaling self-driving car technology, and the latest updates coming to DLSS, G-Sync display tech, and the GeForce Now cloud gaming platform.\n\nWhile none of these hold quite the same appeal as a new generation of consumer graphics cards — something we might see at CES 2027, following the RTX 50-series launch last year — it can still be a lot to parse, especially through the vast slurry of everything else being promoted at the giant Consumer Electronics Show. We’ve rounded up the most significant announcements that Nvidia has made so far to help you stay on top of the news.\n\nVera Rubin ‘AI supercomputer’\n\nThe Vera Rubin launch wasn’t expected until later this year. Image: Nvidia\n\nNvidia launched the Vera Rubin platform during its CES keynote, its next-generation successor to the Blackwell architecture that’s currently used in its most powerful AI chips. Nvidia says this new architecture, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, can train large “mixture of experts” (MoE) AI models as quickly as Blackwell, but with far greater efficiency. Dion Harris, Nvidia’s senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as “six chips that make one AI supercomputer,” which include the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, NVLink 6th-gen switch, Connect-X9 NIC, BlueField4 DPU, and Spectrum-X 102.4T CPO.\n\nAutonomous driving solutions\n\nWatch out, Tesla, Nvidia is coming for your lunch. Image: Nvidia\n\nNvidia is racing against Tesla and Waymo to build technology that will allow cars to fully drive themselves without human assistance, and it may now have the edge. Alpamayo, a newly announced portfolio of AI models, simulation blueprints, and datasets, can give vehicles level 4 autonomy — allowing them to fully drive themselves under specific conditions. “Not only does it take sensor input and activates steering wheel, brakes, and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it is about to take,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the presentation.\n\nThe first passenger car that will be available with this tech is the new Mercedes-Benz CLA, with AI-assisted driving features coming to the US this year. Nvidia’s answer to Full Self-Driving is impressive, according to my colleague Andrew J. Hawkins, who took it for a test-drive, and says that Tesla should be concerned.\n\nDLSS 4.5 is here\n\nHere are a selection of upcoming games that will support the latest DLSS release at launch. Image: Nvidia\n\nThe next major update to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature is now available for all RTX GPUs, providing improvements to image quality and fewer artifacts compared to DLSS 4. This DLSS 4.5 update includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and is supported across more than 400 games and apps via Nvidia’s app.\n\nThis is the technology that allows supported games to be played at higher resolutions without compromising frame rates, a valuable feature for PC gamers with older Nvidia RTX graphics cards in their systems. Those with newer GPUs will see greater benefits from DLSS 4.5, however: it will run faster on RTX 40- and 50-series cards and provides a 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that generates up to five additional frames for every frame rendered.\n\nGeForce Now is coming to Linux and Fire TV\n\nThose flight stick accessories will now be compatible to soar with Nvidia’s cloud platform. Image: Nvidia\n\nNvidia is planning to launch native GeForce Now apps for Linux and Amazon’s Fire TV devices in the coming months, giving more people who may not have adequate gaming hardware access to the cloud streaming service. The first beta will be available for the Ubuntu 24.04 Linux distro, before expanding to additional distributions in the coming weeks. A GeForce Now app for Fire TV Stick 4K Plus and 4K Max is expected to launch early this year. Nvidia is also introducing full flight control support for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in GeForce Now, allowing joysticks and yokes from Thrustmaster and Logitech to work on the cloud gaming service.\n\nNew G-Sync monitors\n\nPrices will vary, but the major specifications are the same across all four models. Image: Nvidia\n\nA new set of G-Sync Pulsar monitors is launching on January 7th that use a built-in light sensor to automatically adjust brightness and color based on your room lighting. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate, with prices starting at $599.\n\n“In bright daylight conditions, it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T14:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T19:44:16.346065"}

The Bowers & Wilkins Px8 are heavily marked down on Amazon in a variety of elegant finishes. They sport premium materials, upgraded sound, and surprisingly adept ANC, all for under $500, depending on how picky you are about the color. They're an excellent pick if you have a discerning ear and want something to take on your next long flight.\n\nThe big star here is the listening experience, powered by a pair of 40-mm carbon cone drivers originally built for the 700 Series speakers. The Px8 have an incredible sound profile that our reviewer Simon Lucas called “a thrillingly adept, informative, and engaging listen without being ostentatious” and complimented in particular the low frequencies for their excellent definition. They have an impressive texture and substance, something you're unlikely to find in other headphones at this discounted price range.\n\nFor not being one of the big names in noise-cancelation, we were impressed by the implementation for both flying and regular noise, although he did note that the settings are limited to on, off, or passthrough. The associated Bowers & Wilkins app has a decent set of options for some equalizer adjustments and other settings, and if you like you can connect your streaming service of choice for in-app listening. They've got decent battery life too, with up to 30 hours of playback on a single charge, and fast charging for seven hours of music after only 15 minutes.\n\nThe price and availability varies by color, and I spotted the tan version at the lowest price of just under $420 at publish. The black, dark forest, and royal burgundy were also marked down below $500, but some of the default listings weren't shipped and sold by Amazon, so make sure to double check before you buy if that's a concern.

The round was led by Felicis and the university’s fund UC Investments.\n\nThe startup bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture with a $100 million seed round in May at a $600 million valuation. This new rounds means it raised $250 million in about seven months.\n\nLMArena is best known for its crowdsourced AI model performance leaderboards. Its consumer website lets a user type a prompt that it sends to two models, with the user then choosing which model did a better job. Those results, which now span more than 5 million monthly users across 150 countries and 60 million conversations a month, the company says, fuel the leaderboards. It ranks various models on a variety of tasks including text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other criteria.\n\nThe models it tests include various flavors of OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Grok, as well as ones that are geared toward specialties like image generation, text to image, or reasoning.\n\nThe company began as Chatbot Arena, an open research project built by UC Berkeley researchers Anastasios Angelopoulos and Wei-Lin Chiang and was originally funded through grants and donations.\n\nLMArena’s leaderboards became something of an obsession among model makers. When LMArena started pursuing revenue, it partnered with select model companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make their flagship models available for its community to evaluate. In April, a group of competitors published a paper alleging that this helped those model makers game the startup’s benchmarks, an allegation LMArena has vehemently denied.\n\nIn September, it publicly launched a commercial service, AI Evaluations, in which enterprises, model labs, and developers can hire the company to perform model evaluations through its community. This gave LMArena an annualized “consumption rate” — as the company describes its annual recurring revenue (ARR) — of $30 million as of December, less than four months after launch\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The company replaced the reputable brands with Dell Premium, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Each series included a base model, as well as “Plus” and “Premium.” Dell isn’t resurrecting its Latitude, Inspiron, or Precision series, and it will still sell “Dell Pro” models.\n\nCredit: Dell This is how Dell breaks down its computer lineup now. This is how Dell breaks down its computer lineup now. Credit: Dell\n\nXPS returns\n\nThe revival of XPS means the return of one of the easiest recommendations for consumer ultralight laptops. Before last year’s shunning, XPS laptops had a reputation for thin, lightweight designs with modern features and decent performance for the price. This year, Dell is even doing away with some of the design tweaks that it introduced to the XPS lineup in 2022, which, unfortunately, were shoppers’ sole option last year.\n\nInheriting traits from the XPS 13 Plus introduced in 2022, the XPS-equivalent laptops that Dell released in 2025 had a capacitive-touch function row without physical buttons, a borderless touchpad with haptic feedback, and a flat, lattice-free keyboard. The design was meant to enable more thermal headroom but made using the computers feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar.\n\nThe XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops launching today have physical function rows. They still have a haptic touchpad, but now the touchpad has comforting left and right borders. And although the XPS 14 and XPS 16 have the same lattice-free keyboard of the XPS 13 Plus, Dell will release a cheaper XPS 13 later this year with a more traditional chiclet keyboard, since those types of keyboards are cheaper to make.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:55:25 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T19:56:52.694050"}

The regular Afeela was there too, five years after its initial debut and still just short of production.\n\nIt shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given the current dour mood around EVs. Growth in global sales is expected to slow significantly in 2026, as China winds down some EV subsidies, Europe wavers on its ban on the sale of gas cars, and the US reverses much of its own policies to get more people to buy EVs.

So, if you don’t already have a Wi-Fi 7 router — and many of us don’t — you might want to consider holding off on upgrading.\n\nRather than focusing on speed upgrades, Wi-Fi 8 promises improved stability. It offers the high speeds and bandwidth of Wi-Fi 7, but with improved power efficiency, higher throughput, and better peer-to-peer communication between devices. Wi-Fi 8 is also better at maintaining fast, stable connections when users are moving devices around, or moving them further away from their router. As a result, Wi-Fi 8 users will experience less “dropping out” or freezing and better streaming and gaming performance.\n\nIf this week’s CES announcements are any indication, we’ll be able to try out Wi-Fi 8 for ourselves within the year.\n\nThe mock up of the Asus ROG NeoCore Wi-Fi 8 router broke when Sean picked it up.

The polyhedral mock up The Verge’s Sean Hollister got a look at this week resembles a 20-sided die with a hollow bottom. According to Asus, the production model will offer the same data speeds as Wi-Fi 7, but with higher throughput and lower latency, so it can move more data with fewer bottlenecks and less lag.\n\n“The plastic mockup broke when I picked it up,” reported Hollister from the Asus booth. “Perfect,” responded Nilay Patel, Editor in Chief of The Verge.\n\nBroadcom also announced some Wi-Fi 8 gear at CES, including the BCM4918 APU and two new dual-band radios, the BCM6714 and BCM6719. All three devices are intended for powering residential Wi-Fi 8 routers and service provider gateways.\n\nSimilarly, on Monday, MediaTek announced its family of Wi-Fi 8 chips, Filogic 8000, which it says will power “premium and flagship devices leveraging Wi-Fi 8 technology,” everything from enterprise access points to smartphones, laptops, TVs, and smart home devices. The first gear featuring a Filogic 8000 chip is expected to launch later this year.\n\nThese new routers and chipsets are arriving only a few months after TP-Link demonstrated the first Wi-Fi 8 prototype connection in October. Despite brands going full steam ahead with Wi-Fi 8, the official IEEE 802.11bn specification hasn’t actually been finalized yet. The current IEEE timeline predicts that the Wi-Fi 8 standard won’t be ratified until mid to late 2028. Yet, Asus says its first Wi-Fi 8 routers are slated to launch this year.

Evotrex says that these energy sources working together can deliver more than 270kWh of usable energy on a single cycle, giving off-grid seekers more freedom to extend their journeys beyond the normal limits.

The RV’s battery allows for AC charging of 6.6kW, or DC charging speeds of 60kW, both off the Tesla-NACS charging standard. And in addition to serving as a home away from home, the PG5 can also power your actual home in the event of a blackout.\n\nIt’s a lot for any one RV owner to manage, so Evotrex also supplies something called the Power Calculator, to help manage your power needs based on environmental factors and use preferences.

That places it among some of the most expensive motorhomes and camper vans on the market, but certainly makes a case for itself with all its extra power offerings.

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nGrok began 2026 as it began 2025: under fire for its AI-generated images.\n\nElon Musk’s chatbot has spent the last week flooding X with nonconsensual, sexualized deepfakes of adults and minors. Circulating screenshots show Grok complying with requests to put real women in lingerie and make them spread their legs, and to put small children in bikinis. Reports of images that were later removed describe even more egregious contents. One X user confirmed in a conversation with The Verge that they came across multiple images of minors with what the prompter dubbed “donut glaze” on their faces, which appear to have since been removed. At one point, Grok was generating about one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, according to one estimate.\n\nX’s terms of service prohibit “the sexualization or exploitation of children.” And on Saturday, the company stated the platform would “take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).” It appears to have taken down some of the worst offenses. But overall, it’s downplayed the incidents. Musk has said that “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” but he’s made it clear through public X posts that he doesn’t believe the general undressing prompts are a problem, and he’s responded to the broader topic with laughing and fire emojis on X. The company’s tepid response has alarmed experts who have spent years trying to address AI-powered sexual harassment and abuse. Multiple governments have said they’re scrutinizing X. But even amid an unprecedented push for online regulation, the path toward policing it or its chatbot’s creations isn’t clear.\n\nxAI, creator of Grok, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Apple or Google when asked if the reports violated their app store policies.\n\nGrok has always allowed, and Musk has openly encouraged, highly sexualized imagery. But over the past week, the ability to ask Grok to edit images — via a new button that allows changes without the original poster’s permission — has gone viral for undressing women and minors. Enforcement of guardrails has been haphazard at best, and most of the supposed responses from X come from Grok itself, which means they’re essentially thought up on the spot. The replies include stating that some of its creations went “against our guidelines for fictional content only” and, at the request of a user, a widely reported apology — something xAI itself doesn’t appear to have issued.\n\nOne of the biggest questions here is whether the images violate laws against CSAM and nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII) of adults, especially in the US, where X is headquartered. The US Department of Justice proscribes “digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor” that include sexual activity or suggestive nudity. And the Take It Down Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in May 2025, prohibits nonconsensual AI-generated “intimate visual depictions” and requires certain platforms to rapidly remove them.\n\nCelebrities and influencers have described feeling violated by sexualized AI-generated images; according to screenshots, Grok has produced pictures of the singer Momo from TWICE, actress Millie Bobby Brown, actor Finn Wolfhard, and many more. Grok-generated images are also being used specifically to attack women with political power.\n\n“It is a tool for expressing the underlying misogyny that pervades every corner of American society and most societies around the world,” Riana Pfefferkorn, a policy fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), told The Verge. “It is a privacy violation, it is a violation of consent and of boundaries, it is extremely intrusive, it is a form of gendered violence in its way.” Perhaps above all, explicit images of minors — including through dedicated “nudify” apps — have become a growing problem for law enforcement.\n\nOn Monday, the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), a group of hundreds of consumer-focused nonprofits, publicly called for both state and federal action against xAI for “creating and distributing Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and other non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) with Generative AI,” sending a letter signed by a handful of organizations to the Federal Trade Commission and US attorneys general.\n\nYet the specifics of what’s prohibited by US law are “pretty murky,” Mary Anne Franks, a professor in intellectual property, technology, and civil rights law at the George Washington University Law School, said. “Part of what I’ve not been able to figure out either is ... whether this is actually crossing the line into actual nudity and sexual situations.”\n\nUsing AI to generate an image of an identifiable minor in a bikini (or potentially even naked) — though unequivocally unethical — may not be illegal under current CSAM laws in the US, experts told The Verge. That said, images like the ones that appear to include semen could violate both preexisting CSAM laws and the Take It Down Act — and Franks suspects these aren’t the worst offenses out there. “We can imagine that whatever’s hitting the mainstream media, there’s probably a million worse things that people are also generating … Every possible prompt you could think of is probably coming up,” Franks said.\n\nBut despite these federal laws and a plethora of state-level ones, experts say it’s difficult to enforce bans on AI-generated sexual imagery right now — and even harder to determine what responsibility platforms could have. “Ultimately there are conflicting laws, and there’s no legal precedent” for much of it, Shael Norris, founding executive director of SafeBAE, an organization working to end sexual violence, told The Verge.\n\nJohn Langford, a visiting clinical associate professor of law at Yale Law School and counsel at Protect Democracy, said the patchwork of sexual deepfake bans remains sparsely tested in court. “All this is sort of new — we’re just now starting to develop case law on what falls where,” said Langford. But there’s some yardstick, at least: For the Grok creations that do depict identifiable minors, we do now have “precedent [that] any computer-generated image of a real child that is sexually explicit is illegal,” Drew Davis, SafeBAE’s director of strategic initiatives, said.\n\nThere are a handful of current federal prosecutions for creating or possessing AI-modified images of real children, and several dozen at the state level, said Pfefferkorn. “When it comes to whether the companies themselves are liable, that’s where we are, I think, in uncharted territory,” Pfefferkorn said.\n\nDavis added that we’re “dealing with a complicated legal landscape when it comes to AI-generated images of minors.” That’s partly because the grace period for the “take it down” portion of the Take It Down Act, in which platforms must respond to such content, stands until May.\n\nAlso, Section 230 has long shielded companies from liability for content other people posted. But as companies turn to bots like Grok to allow users to generate their own images, it’s unclear what liability they bear. “This is why I’m so interested to see if there’s going to be … creative prosecution here,” Franks said, adding, “It’s about whether or not, by virtue of creating these images, they have violated the criminal provision.”\n\nThe caveat, multiple experts told The Verge, is that virtually all of the criminal statutes dictate that the offender had to post the content with the knowledge that it was going to cause harm. Yale Law’s Langford said that part introduces “really hard questions on whether you could hold Grok or xAI liable.” But, others say, personhood is attributed to corporations in other situations — why not this one? Musk’s frequent, unfiltered posting also offers an unusual form of insight.\n\nPfefferkorn believes this will be a “pivotal year in terms of fighting this problem” and said that she wouldn’t be surprised if class-action lawsuits surfaced.\n\nBut to complicate things even further, Musk and X have close ties to the current administration — Musk’s ostensibly defunct Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was at one point working within the FTC itself, the agency tasked with enforcing the Take It Down Act. Beyond the US, the Trump administration has used trade talks to discourage other countries from regulating American internet platforms. Musk and Trump are publicly on good terms, and any country that attempts to punish X could potentially face the administration’s ire, on top of likely noncompliance from X itself.\n\nEven so, an international backlash is building. Members of the French government said they would investigate the matter. The Indian IT ministry ordered xAI to submit a report about how it would prevent further material that’s “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” And the Malaysian government’s Communications and Multimedia Commission said it had “taken note with serious concern” of complaints about misuse of AI on X, particularly the “digital manipulation of images of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, or otherwise harmful content.”\n\nGrok has persistently gone off the rails in sometimes bizarre and frequently sexual ways, from its antisemitic breakdown to allowing people to create partially nude images of Taylor Swift. Outside experts have expressed concerns about its slapdash safety efforts — after the July 2025 release of Grok 4, it took more than a month for the company to release a model card outlining things like safety features and test results, typically seen as a bare minimum in the industry.\n\nWithout outside pressure, Grok’s deepfakes problem seems unlikely to end anytime soon. Some of the most egregious images seem to be taken down after the fact. But the larger guardrails, which are detailed in Grok 4.1’s model card with a brief mention of CSAM, clearly aren’t working as well as planned. And Musk’s recent comments suggest he doesn’t see much wrong with the current state of Grok. One of the most puzzling things about the whole saga, Pfefferkorn said, isn’t that an AI platform can be induced to create potential CSAM — it’s that “we have not necessarily seen, so far, a lot of concern about whether they’re coming up right close to that line.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T15:08:18-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T20:33:46.503452"}

Among other initiatives, Tuesday’s announcement touts the extension of Nvidia’s music AI model Music Flamingo, which is designed to mimic how humans understand music by recognizing nuanced elements like song structure, harmony, emotional arcs, and chord progressions.\n\nBut UMG’s statement stresses that its collaboration with Nvidia pursues “responsible AI” meant to make it easier to discover, engage with, and create music. On that last point, the companies will promote their “shared objectives of advancing human music creation and rightsholder compensation.”\n\nThe Music Flamingo model, which was published in November 2025 by Nvidia and researchers at University of Maryland, College Park, can process tracks up to 15 minutes long. Details are scarce about exactly how the model will be incorporated into UMG’s catalog, but artists will be able to use Music Flamingo to better analyze their own music, as well as describe and share the music “with unprecedented depth,” according to the statement. Fans, meanwhile, can find music in new ways beyond genre or playlist, such as with emotion or “cultural resonance.”\n\nThe announcement is similarly vague about how the partnership will work when it comes to AI-driven music creation tools, but promises a “dedicated artist incubator” to help design and test out tools, “serving as a direct antidote to generic, ‘AI slop’ outputs, and placing artists at the center of responsible AI innovation.” What that means in practice remains to be seen.\n\nWhile not UMG’s first partnership with an AI company, Nvidia is perhaps its highest-profile collaboration within the sector. UMG is embracing “the opportunities that AI presents,” hoping to “direct AI’s unprecedented transformational potential towards the service of artists and their fans,” UMG CEO Lucian Grainge said in a statement.\n\nNvidia’s AI model coupled with “UMG’s unmatched catalog and creative ecosystem” will “change how fans discover, understand, and engage with music on a global scale,” Nvidia’s vice president and general manager of media, Richard Kerris, said in a statement. “And we’ll do it the right way: responsibly, with safeguards that protect artists’ work, ensure attribution, and respect copyright.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T15:07:03-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T20:33:46.659069"}

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nThe End of an Era\n\nThough it has been more than a year since Taylor Swift brought her epic Eras Tour to an end, fans still can’t get enough. In this six-episode docuseries Swift shares her own perspective on the stadium tour, which she describes as a “massive bonding experience” between her and thousands of her beloved fans each night. From the emotional prep it takes to embark on such an adventure to the logistics of pulling it all off, the series delivers a one-of-a-kind experience. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a Taylor Swift event without some famous friends like Sabrina Carpenter, Ed Sheeran, and now-fiancé Travis Kelce popping up along the way.\n\nSecrets Declassified With David Duchovny\n\nThe truth is out there, and David Duchovny is still searching for answers. Fans of the The X-Files will enjoy this History Channel docuseries, which attempts to uncover the details of the government’s most clandestine files, dealing with everything from deep space to dark science and, yes, the possible existence of aliens.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nMore than 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, this small-screen adaptation has been praised for how faithful it remains to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. Season 2, which arrived on December 10, sees Percy tasked with undertaking an epic odyssey to save the camp. A third season is in the works.\n\nThe Beatles Anthology\n\nDisney may be known for its Marvel and Star Wars content, but the streamer’s got a lot of love for the Fab Four, too (see: Get Back, below). This nine-part docuseries, which originally aired on Britain’s ITV in 1995, has been reedited, restored, and expanded for Disney+. The series offers an up-close and quite intimate look at the history of one of the music world’s most influential rock bands, as told by the men who lived it.\n\nFire and Water: Making the Avatar Films\n\nFor nearly 30 years, James Cameron has dominated the top of the Highest-Grossing Movies of All-Time charts—first with Titanic (1997), which still holds the No. 4 position, then with Avatar (2009) and Avatar: The Way of Water (2022), which hold the No. 1 and No. 3 spots, respectively. Will Avatar: Fire and Ash, which has earned more than $1 billion just a few weeks into its theatrical run, manage to supplant one of its predecessors? While we wait to learn the answer, Disney+ is taking a deep dive (no pun intended) into the movie series in this two-part docuseries. While the technology behind the films has always been a huge part of their story, from the 3D camera system Cameron and his team developed to the strides made in the art of performance capture, the actors themselves are a major focus of this behind-the-scenes series. Cameron gathers up his key contributors, including stars Zoe Saldaña, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, and Kate Winslet (who joined in the second film) to discuss how—even with all that groundbreaking technology—it’s the actors who make Pandora real.\n\nMarvel Zombies\n\nIf Marvel Zombies gives you big The Walking Dead vibes, there’s a good reason for that: It’s based on a comic book series that was cocreated by Robert Kirkman, who cocreated The Walking Dead comics. Basically, it imagines a totally new MCU timeline in which a virus has turned most of the world’s population—including the Avengers—into zombies. Meanwhile, a determined group of survivors are doing their best to find a cure—and not get bitten. Some of Marvel’s biggest stars have come along for the ride to give voice to their characters, including Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova, David Harbour’s Red Guardian, Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda Maximoff, Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man, Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie, and Hailee Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop.\n\nLimitless\n\nLongevity is having a moment, and even onscreen gods like Chris Hemsworth are feeling the pressure to do whatever they can to live the longest, healthiest life possible. In this National Geographic series, which—oddly enough—was cocreated by Darren Aronofsky, the Thor star works with a range of scientists, doctors, and adventurers to push his body to the limit in order to discover its full potential. That he faces it all with his trademark sense of humor, and against the backdrop of some truly breathtaking locations around the world, makes it all the more entertaining and inspiring.\n\nHurricane Katrina: Race Against Time\n\n“In order to prevent something, you’ve got to understand why it happened in the first place.” That’s the lesson one New Orleans resident learned from surviving Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the city 20 years ago. In this fascinating Nat Geo documentary, people who survived the storm—plus scientists and authorities who worked to save the lives of those who were at the center of it—recount the destruction the storm brought with it. It laments the lack of government response to an American city in need while paying tribute to the heroic actions of everyday people who came together to save New Orleans and the resilience of the people who still call the city home today.\n\nEyes of Wakanda\n\nDisney is betting big on the Black Panther universe. Just one month after the premiere of the live-action series Ironheart (see below) came this new animated anthology series that delves even further into the Wakanda mythology. Two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Coogler—the man behind both Black Panther movies—developed this four-episode prequel in which the Hatut Zaraze, aka Wakanda’s “War Dogs,” embark on adventure-filled missions to retrieve long-lost Vibranium artifacts.\n\nIronheart\n\nRyan Coogler is responsible for what is arguably the best movie in the MCU (2018’s Black Panther), and now he’s executive producing one of its most interesting small-screen endeavors. Playwright Chinaka Hodge created this series, which picks up right after the events featured in 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It stars Dominique Thorne, who reprises her role as Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, a brilliant MIT student who has successfully managed to create a Tony Stark–like suit of armor. It gives her the kind of invincibility that changes her outlook on the world—and leads her down a pothole-filled path that could see her heroic character go the way of the antihero in a way that critics have described as being similar to The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano and Breaking Bad’s Walter White.\n\nDoctor Who\n\nSpring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era for Doctor Who fans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. He did it all over again with a second season, which aired a game-changing finale in May that has viewers wondering where the Doctor will be headed next. Russell T. Davies is also back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), and new addition Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu). The BBC’s partnership with Disney+ ended in October, so the upcoming Christmas special—and future seasons—will be streamed elsewhere.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who think there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows that one person needs and those who are counting down the days until The Mandalorian & Grogu arrives in theaters next year. If you’re part of that latter group, you’re in good company—and have plenty of series to choose from, including this six-part anthology that follows 2022’s Tales of the Jedi and last year’s Tales of the Empire (see below). In true Star Wars style, it tells the story of two villains, former assassin/bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and outlaw Cad Bane, who form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to build new lives for themselves, until Bane catches up with an old colleague, who has switched sides to become a law-abiding marshal. Dark versus light battle it out once more.\n\nAndor\n\nAndor—which scored five well-deserved Emmys, including one for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series—is something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the two-time Oscar nominee behind Michael Clayton and a writer on the Bourne movies, it’s the origin story of one of Rogue One's most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight, Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil fans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and TV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Echo, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and one massive overhaul later, fans seem to think it was worth the wait. Born Again sees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight playbook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in. A second season is arriving in March 2026 and Disney has already greenlit a third.\n\nWin or Lose\n\nWill Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series. Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n\nFour years after it was first announced, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arrived early this year. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)! A second season has already been confirmed, though likely won’t premiere until late 2026.\n\nGoosebumps: The Vanishing\n\nFor more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps books have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. The always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series. Its second, and final, season brought an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (including Friends star David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\n\nDo you love Star Wars but wish it had more Warriors/The Wizard of Oz/The Brave Little Toaster energy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. For Skeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel\" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.\n\nLego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy\n\nSig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill and Ahmed Best lending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.\n\nAgatha All Along\n\nAfter Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’s WandaVision miniseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series with Agatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events of WandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.\n\nBluey\n\nYes, Bluey is technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures\n\nIf helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version of Muppet Babies, is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world. Season 3 dropped in December.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nA Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity from The Matrix series, that’s by design. Series creator Leslye Headland told Empire that the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get of The Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Empire\n\nIt’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and The Mandalorian & Grogu won't arrive until May 22. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.\n\nX-Men '97\n\nOf all the big-budget X-Men movies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true—and has a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score to prove it. When the revival arrived in 2024, many of the original voice actors returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.\n\nRenegade Nell\n\nLouisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. What is surprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series as Happy Valley and Gentleman Jack.\n\nDinosaurs\n\nNineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.\n\nEcho\n\nThis Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie from Hawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. Cox may be a relative newcomer to Hollywood, but she deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.\n\nBehind the Attraction\n\nDisneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.\n\nLoki\n\nThe MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet while Loki is undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it, Loki has a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season in Loki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” he admitted to Variety in 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”\n\nDaredevil\n\nBefore Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning with Daredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series, Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived last year (see above).\n\nAhsoka\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: Wait, another Star Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans, Ahsoka just might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 of The Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April, and will welcome Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker back into the Star Wars fold.\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nIn 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, series The Wonder Years for a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as are all six seasons of the original series, which premiered in 1988.\n\nKizazi Moto: Generation Fire\n\nWhile Black Panther may have gotten an official sequel with 2022’s Wakanda Forever (which is, of course, available to stream on Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.\n\nAmerican Born Chinese\n\nOscar winners—and Everything Everywhere All at Once costars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.\n\nStar Wars: Visions\n\nFor a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case with Visions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nThe Mandalorian was, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian really set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, like Andor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu, which arrives Memorial Day weekend.\n\nMs. Marvel\n\nWith Ms. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe, Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson in The Marvels.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nEwan McGregor has not always had the kindest words for the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also had plenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back\n\nIn January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording of Let It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for in 2022, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nMoon Knight\n\nOscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents with Moon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. For Moon Knight, Isaac told Empire that he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.\n\nThe Muppet Show\n\nWhile The Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired during Saturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman's Saturday Night learned. When SNL became a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history. And there's a new chapter in the works. In September, Seth Rogen confirmed that he’ll be partnering with Sabrina Carpenter to revive the original series for a Disney+ special later this year.\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe Punisher is yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff of Daredevil. Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.\n\nBoy Meets World\n\nIf ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons of Girl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nJust about six months after Daredevil arrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property with Jessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.\n\nHawkeye\n\nYet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hawkeye gives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensemble Avengers films, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades of Die Hard as the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.\n\nMonsters at Work\n\nMonsters at Work is the Monsters, Inc. spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.\n\nThe Bad Batch\n\nYes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth. The Bad Batch is an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.\n\nWandaVision\n\nThis slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events of WandaVision.\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nAfter the surreal sitcom stylings of WandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nStar Wars Rebels\n\nAccessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nHave you got some time on your hands? Well, the 37 seasons of The Simpsons currently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.\n\nX-Men: The Animated Series\n\nIf you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.\n\nMarvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThis seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.\n\nAgent Carter\n\nAgent Carter is a better show than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.\n\nInside Pixar\n\nThere’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.\n\nWhat If …?\n\nHere’s an animated series based on one simple question: What if? The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had a Sliding Doors moment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T20:33:47.069134"}

He just introduced a bill to ban AI chatbots in toys until safety regulations are developed.", "content": "Senator Steve Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Monday that would place a four-year ban on the sale and manufacture of toys with AI chatbot capabilities for kids under 18. The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”\n\n“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”\n\nThe bill, dubbed SB 287, comes in the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.\n\nIn over the past year, lawsuits filed by families whose children died by suicide after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently passed SB 243, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.\n\nWhile the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group PIRG Education Fund warned that toys like Kumma – a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot – could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. NBC News found that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.\n\nOpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an “AI-powered product” in 2025, but delayed their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026.\n\n“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:22:21 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T20:33:47.225825"}

It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane.\n\nThese digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera.

The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.\n\n​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time.

Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.\n\nThe knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for pre-order.\n\nA musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head\n\nImage Credits:Lollipop Star\n\nMusical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too?

{"title": "The Inevitable Rise of the Art TV", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/art-frame-tv-trends/", "summary": "New televisions from Amazon, Hisense, TCL, and others are designed to display fine art and look like a painting when they’re switched off. It’s all thanks to smaller living spaces and new screen tech.", "content": "The Samsung Frame TV, first announced in 2017, doesn’t look all that great as an actual television. But switch it off and it sure is pretty—certainly much better to look at than an empty black void.\n\nThis is thanks to its matte-finish, anti-glare screen and the picture-frame-like bezels that together transform whatever fine art you choose to display on the TV when it's in standby mode (Samsung offers a variety of high-resolution digital slides) into something that resembles a framed painting. In the years since its debut and through a few updates, the Frame TV has become one of the more considered options for people who live in smaller spaces without dedicated rooms for watching TV.\n\nIt has taken a while for other brands to catch up, but we're now seeing a huge wave of Frame-like TVs hit the market. The trend is largely driven by aesthetes in cities where smaller living rooms are the norm, but it's getting a boost from advances in screen design.\n\nLate last year, Hisense announced its CanvasTV, a frame competitor that also has a matte screen and displays art. (We have a review unit coming shortly.) TCL has the similar NXTvision model that uses a Vincent van Gogh self-portrait in the marketing, and LG has announced the Gallery TV (also repping van Gogh) for later this year. Even Amazon has decided to throw its hat in the ring, with the Ember Artline TV. Announced this week at CES 2026, Amazon's $899 television can display one of 2,000 works of art (available for free to Ember Artline owners) and even has a tool that uses Alexa AI to help you decide which artworks are the best fit for your room.\n\nThe frame of Amazon’s new Ember Artline TV comes in several colors to match your decor. Courtesy of Amazon\n\nSo what's so great about Art TVs, and why do brands seem to be pivoting so hard into the category?\n\nPart of it has to do with personal space. It's true that many younger buyers just don't have the same taste or sense of style as folks from previous generations. But also, young city-dwelling professionals are less likely to have the room to place a large screen in a dedicated area in their home, a pain point compounded by the fact that TV screen sizes have ballooned over the past decade.\n\nThe other reason TV makers are getting artsy has to do with the evolution of TV technology itself. Brands are choosing to step into this space now because they have finally developed the means to create matte screens that can accurately represent a painting or a fine art photograph. Though Samsung is a pioneer in the space, matte LED screens are enjoying something of a renaissance across all television brands.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:41:46 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T20:54:40.271918"}

With scant evidence, Shirley accuses the centers of sweeping fraud, tying it to previous federal fraud cases pursued by Joe Biden’s administration in Minnesota. The men knock on doors, argue with workers who refuse them entry, and conduct man-on-the-street-style interviews, asking people if they’ve ever seen children at the centers.\n\nThe fraud Shirley claims he’s found remains elusive. Following his video, state officials visited nine businesses featured and found they were “operating as expected,” with children present at eight and one center that wasn’t yet open. State officials told reporters that previous investigations into some of the centers did not uncover evidence of fraud; four investigations are ongoing, they said. Officials also said that one of the childcare centers Shirley visited had been closed since 2022.\n\nNone of this stopped the video from going viral, however, or catching the eye of President Donald Trump’s administration. “This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer Prizes],” JD Vance said on X of Shirley, a 23-year-old right-wing content creator who fashions himself as a citizen journalist. Shirley’s post on X has 138 million “views” — the number of times a post was shown to X users — and more than 3 million views on YouTube. A few days after Shirley posted the video, federal agencies had launched a childcare fraud tipline, promising to prosecute violators “to the FULLEST extent of the law.”\n\nThere has never been a better time to be a far-right content creator\n\nWithin days, Shirley’s video had been used to trigger a national news cycle. Donald Trump’s administration said it would freeze federal childcare funding to Minnesota, where local childcare centers reported threats, break-ins, and frightened families in the wake of the video. Thousands of federal agents would be deployed to Minneapolis, the administration said. Shirley’s daycare stunt is one of many: In a previous video, he paid day laborers $20 to hold pro-Biden signs in front of the White House. And his work — along with that of countless other influencers — is grist for a content mill that now has a direct audience at the highest levels of power.\n\nThere has never been a better time to be a far-right content creator. The right has built an empire of online personalities, shows, and outlets that reach millions of people across platforms, centered on Elon Musk’s X: a place where influencers, government officials, and foreign grifters commingle, overseen by a billionaire owner that aligns with them politically. Shirley and others like him are able to elicit maximum attention and reaction — from officials with a penchant for posting, like Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, and by extension from everyone else reacting to the news. Viral content becomes official government policy.\n\nThe line between influencer and politician is a thin one. The Intercept reported that “David” from the video was David Hoch, who previously ran for Minnesota attorney general and called Muslims “demons” on now-deleted social media accounts. In the video, Hoch says the information he has is “100 percent accurate coming directly from research done by people at the state capitol”; The Intercept reported on ties between Hoch and a Republican staffer who appears in emails shown in Shirley’s video. Minnesota state Rep. Lisa Demuth — a Republican running for governor — also claimed to have worked with Shirley to “expose fraud.” Shirley initially denied knowing who Demuth was and accused her of “clout chasing” before quickly pivoting and wishing her luck on her campaign. Shirley did not immediately respond to questions about whether he, Hoch, or his team had communicated with state and federal officials while producing the video.\n\nA viral post can bestow both algorithmic success and a rapid response from the federal government. In October 2025, Savanah Hernandez, a Turning Point USA-aligned content creator, posted a short video on X showing merchants on Canal Street in New York City. “One of the migrants explained to me that they’re operating ‘without a license’ and if the police catch them, they’ll confiscate all of their items,” Hernandez wrote. “Perhaps @ICEgov should go check this corner out.” Shirley had earlier done the same schtick, in a YouTube video titled “I Confronted Dangerous Migrant Scammers in NYC | Canal Street.”\n\nA few days after Hernandez’s post, dozens of federal agents swarmed the area in a raid targeting street vendors. The Department of Homeland Security said on X it had arrested nine immigrants; four US citizens were also reportedly held without federal charges. (Hernandez and Shirley both participated in a White House-hosted event on antifa in October.)\n\nShirley’s video from Minneapolis takes a well-worn YouTuber format and applies it to a high-profile situation that has been in the news for years. Shirley uses dramatic music to set the tone and an unpolished filming style to make viewers feel like they’re there — that because they did not see any children present, there must be massive fraud happening. Nuance, details, confirmation, or follow-up doesn’t suit a format that is measured primarily by whether you get enough watch time to be able to monetize your video.\n\nInfluencers have supplanted cable news talking heads as megaphones for politicians’ messages and platforms. They are cheap, fast, and savvy — drop a clickbait video on platforms like X, which can then act like a tornado maker for right-wing fury. Influencers know that information doesn’t need to be new, true, or fair. It just needs to hit at the right time and be boosted by the right people, at which point it might even get picked up by traditional news outlets, as the daycare story did. The Trump administration knows the influencer game well because its ranks are filled with them. That the president and senior staff have X tabs open on a giant screen in a war room tells us where they believe politics and governing take place.\n\nIn December, Axios published a chart visualizing search interest throughout 2025 for dozens of trending news cycles: Jeffrey Epstein, Charlie Kirk, RealID, Cracker Barrel. Most of these topics peak when news hits and then trickle off — but some endure for months with intermittent surges, like searches for Gaza, inflation, Labubus, and KPop Demon Hunters. If you rely on social media algorithms for your livelihood, audience, or to maintain power, you must stay on trend at all times and develop an ability to see a wave before it crashes.\n\nIf we made a chart for 2026 news cycles, “Somali daycare fraud” may very well be one of these flashes in the pan that surges and then disappears. Whatever other viral news events this year brings, we should expect to see the influencers — elected and not — swarm and milk them dry before carrying on to the next crisis. Each event will be the “the worst fraud in human history.” Merch will follow. The feds will not be far behind.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T16:24:59-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T21:27:06.978415"}

The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software.\n\nNow, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.\n\nThe Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup co-founded by Shashua in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company.\n\nThe transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.\n\n“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”\n\nMentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap.\n\nThe benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nIn other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023.\n\nOf course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute.\n\nThe acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:10:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T21:27:07.334316"}

The CTIA said that “jamming blocks all communications, including lawful communications such as 911 calling,” and argued that the FCC “has no authority to allow jamming.”\n\nCTIA members AT&T and Verizon expressed their displeasure in separate comments to the FCC. “The proposed legal framework is based on a flawed factual premise,” AT&T wrote.\n\nWhile the Communications Act prohibits interference with authorized radio communications, Carr’s plan tries to sidestep this prohibition by proposing to de-authorize certain communications, AT&T wrote. “This legal framework, however, is premised on a fundamental factual error: the assumption that jammers will only block ‘unauthorized’ communications without impacting lawful uses.

You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doomscrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\n\nIn fact, two new Scribes have just hit the market: a snazzy color model called the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and a black-and-white mid-tier model called the Amazon Kindle Scribe 32GB. A new entry-level Scribe without a front light will also be available soon, though Amazon has yet to provide a specific release date.\n\nMeanwhile, many of Amazon’s last-gen e-readers are still available (and at nice discounts).\n\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\n\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”? Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference.\n\nThe most recent entry-level Kindle — which starts at an MSRP of $109.99 — was introduced in 2024. It boasts a bright 94-nit display, fine contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns than the 2022 version. It also comes in a “matcha” green, just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\n\nIn the past, Amazon’s ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $79.99 ($30 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, you can buy the base-model Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $89.99 ($20 off), which is a pretty good discount.\n\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\n\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The latest Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\n\nIn terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\n\nPreviously, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target at its full price of $129.99.\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\n\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched in 2024, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\n\nDuring events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $124.99. Sadly, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).\n\nLike other Kindles, the newest Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations — including an ad-free Signature Edition that’s identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that automatically adjusts when needed.\n\nIn the past, the Signature Edition has been discounted to $149.99 ($50 off). Currently, however, it is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual price of $199.99. You can also pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off). It’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in black, green, or pink for $257.97 ($25 off).\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\n\nAmazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers optional parental controls. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\n\nAlthough the Kindle Paperwhite Kids has been known to occasionally drop to $129.99 ($50 off) during special sales events, it’s currently only available for its usual price of $179.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\n\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2025) deals\n\nThe third-gen Kindle Scribe, which launched late last year, is even bigger than its 10.2-inch predecessor. It offers an 11-inch display with 300ppi resolution, 32GB of storage, and the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the last Scribe, Amazon introduced a new Active Canvas feature — letting you scribble notes directly on ebook pages — as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting. The latest version adds a Premium Pen, a front light, and slimmer bezels than its second-gen cousin.\n\nAmazon’s third-gen Scribe is currently selling for $499.99 at Amazon, which is the typical MSRP. A less expensive version should also be available soon; it drops storage to 16GB and removes the front light, but still includes the premium pen. It will be priced at $429.99 at launch.\n\nKindle Scribe 32GB $ 500 $ 500 The third-gen Kindle Scribe 32GB is even bigger than its 10.2-inch predecessor; it offers an 11-inch display with 300ppi resolution and the same great battery life that Kindles are known for. Read More $500 at Amazon\n\nThe recently launched Kindle Scribe Colorsoft adds color to the mix, while offering the same dimensions as the third-gen Scribe, along with front lighting, the ability to take and upload notes, and great battery life. However, our reviewer noted that the colors aren’t particularly vibrant and that there’s minimal ghosting. She also found the device’s thinness somewhat limiting, making it more challenging to use in certain situations, such as one-handed bus riding. The new Scribe Colorsoft comes with 32GB of storage for $629.99; if you want 64GB, it will run you $679.99.\n\nKindle Scribe Colorsoft $ 630 $ 630 The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon’s first note-taking e-reader with a color screen. It features an 11-inch display, a slimmer design, an improved interface, an updated stylus, and a new AI-powered search feature that can quickly summarize documents. Read More $630 at Amazon\n\nIf you want to save a bit of cash, you can pick up the second-gen (but still excellent) Kindle Scribe, which is on sale with 16GB and a Premium Pen for $279.99 ($120 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also get the 32GB version for $10 more at Amazon and Best Buy. And you can also pick up the 16GB Scribe at Amazon as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and a plant-based leather cover starting at $444.97 ($55 off).\n\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\n\nToward the end of 2024, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.\n\nMore recently, Amazon introduced a cheaper Colorsoft, one that comes with only 16GB of storage. It lacks wireless charging and an auto-adjusting front light, but it’s otherwise identical to the first-gen model. The 16GB model has a full retail price of $249.99; it went down to $169.99 on Black Friday, though you can still get it now for $199.99 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. The 32GB Signature Edition, meanwhile, is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual asking price of $279.99.\n\nThat said, you can save some money at Amazon on the step-up model if you buy it as part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black, pink, or green. If you want a more premium experience, Amazon also sells it with a leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off).\n\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Kids deals\n\nIn July of 2025, Amazon announced a kid-friendly version of the Colorsoft with 16GB of storage and an MSRP of $269.99. Like the Signature Edition, the Kindle Colorsoft Kids offers a seven-inch color display and IPX8 water resistance, but it lacks wireless charging. The ad-free ebook reader also comes with one of two covers, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, an extended two-year warranty, and optional parental controls.\n\nAlthough it fell to $189.99 ($80 off) as recently as November, the Colorsoft Kids is currently only available for $219.99 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\n\nUpdate, January 7th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added information regarding Amazon’s latest Kindle Scribe models.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T16:26:41-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T21:46:00.473664"}

Elon Musk's X is now removing barriers to entry—and making the results public.", "content": "Elon Musk hasn’t stopped Grok, the chatbot developed by his artificial intelligence company xAI, from generating sexualized images of women. After reports emerged last week that the image generation tool on X was being used to create sexualized images of children, Grok has created potentially thousands of nonconsensual images of women in “undressed” and “bikini” photos.\n\nEvery few seconds, Grok is continuing to create images of women in bikinis or underwear in response to user prompts on X, according to a WIRED review of the chatbots’ publicly posted live output. On Tuesday, at least 90 images involving women in swimsuits and in various levels of undress were published by Grok in under five minutes, analysis of posts show.\n\nThe images do not contain nudity but involve the Musk-owned chatbot “stripping” clothes from photos that have been posted to X by other users. Often, in an attempt to evade Grok’s safety guardrails, users are, not necessarily successfully, requesting photos to be edited to make women wear a “string bikini” or a “transparent bikini.”\n\nWhile harmful AI image generation technology has been used to digitally harass and abuse women for years—these outputs are often called deepfakes and created by “nudify” software—the ongoing use of Grok to create vast numbers of nonconsensual images marks seemingly the most mainstream and widespread abuse instance to date. Unlike specific harmful nudify or “undress” software, Grok doesn’t charge the user money to generate images, produces results in seconds, and is available to millions of people on X—all of which may help to normalize the creation of nonconsensual intimate imagery.\n\n“When a company offers generative AI tools on their platform, it is their responsibility to minimize the risk of image-based abuse,” says Sloan Thompson, the director of training and education at EndTAB, an organization that works to tackle tech facilitated abuse. “What’s alarming here is that X has done the opposite. They’ve embedded AI-enabled image abuse directly into a mainstream platform, making sexual violence easier and more scalable.”\n\nGrok’s creation of sexualized imagery started to go viral on X at the end of last year, although the system’s ability to create such images has been known for months. In recent days, photos of social media influencers, celebrities, and politicians have been targeted by users on X, who can reply to a post from another account and ask Grok to change an image that has been shared.\n\nWomen who have posted photos of themselves have had accounts reply to them and successfully ask Grok to turn the photo into a “bikini” image. In one instance, multiple X users requested Grok alter an image of the deputy prime minister of Sweden to show her wearing a bikini. Two government ministers in the UK have also been “stripped” to bikinis, reports say.\n\nImages on X show fully clothed photographs of women, such as one person in a lift and another in the gym, being transformed into images with little clothing. “@grok put her in a transparent bikini,” a typical message reads. In a different series of posts, a user asked Grok to “inflate her chest by 90%,” then “Inflate her thighs by 50%,” and, finally, to “Change her clothes to a tiny bikini.”\n\nOne analyst who has tracked explicit deepfakes for years, and asked not to be named for privacy reasons, says that Grok has likely become one of the largest platforms hosting harmful deepfake images. “It’s wholly mainstream,” the researcher says. “It’s not a shadowy group [creating images], it’s literally everyone, of all backgrounds. People posting on their mains.

The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an eighteen page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.\n\n“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter?

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nThere have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor.\n\nGenerative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.\n\nMax Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.\n\n“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Max Spero, founder of Pangram Labs, told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”\n\nTools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.\n\nCase in point: when I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else.

CEO Jensen Huang’s characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed 90-minute keynote focused almost entirely on the company’s dominant AI business, relegating the company’s gaming-related announcements to a separate video posted later in the evening.\n\nInstead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia’s basket of upscaling and frame generation technologies.\n\nDLSS upscaling is being improved by a new “second-generation transformer model” that Nvidia says has been “trained on an expanded data set” to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia’s Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it’s working from a lower-resolution source image.\n\nDLSS Multi-Frame Generation is also improving, increasing the number of AI-generated frames per rendered frame from three to five. This new 6x mode for DLSS MFG is being paired with something called Dynamic Multi-Frame Generation, where the number of AI-generated frames can dynamically change, increasing generated frames during “demanding scenes,” and decreasing the number of generated frames during simpler scenes “so it only computes what’s needed.”\n\nThe standard caveats for Multi-Frame Generation still apply: It still needs an RTX 50-series GPU (the 40-series can still only generate one frame for every rendered frame, and older cards can’t generate extra frames at all), and the game still needs to be running at a reasonably high base frame rate to minimize lag and weird rendering artifacts. It remains a useful tool for making fast-running games run faster, but it won’t help make an unplayable frame rate into a playable one.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:56:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T22:27:45.835722"}

Not a subscriber yet? It’s a new year, so why not treat yourself?\n\nIn 2022, Jake Sullivan, then national security adviser under President Joe Biden and a powerful figure in the White House’s foreign policy team, assembled an interagency planning exercise out of the Situation Room: What were all the possible circumstances and outcomes of an AI arms race between the US and China — from trade wars to real wars, possibly even the arrival of AGI — and how would the federal government respond?\n\nThe details and results of that simulation are classified, but on Sunday, I spoke to Sullivan and asked if he could at least describe one outcome: Did they ever run a scenario where the AI industry’s profit interests were driving foreign policy instead of the government?\n\nHis candid response surprised me. “I confess that we did not factor in the possibility that we would actually be rolling back our export controls.”\n\nSullivan, now a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is definitively pro-artificial intelligence and pro-innovation. But he thinks about AI in a way that a former national security adviser would: as a means to gain a geopolitical advantage against adversaries like China. His decision at the time was to place tight controls on the high-end chips that American companies were allowed to sell to China, extending a policy that dates back to the Cold War: Don’t sell high-end tech to America’s foreign enemies. Despite extreme backlash from tech companies, Sullivan was confident his policies would remain in place once Biden left office, telling Bloomberg in a January 2025 interview that “by and large,” tech CEOs accepted the need for those export controls, and that he wasn’t worried about incoming President Donald Trump cutting deals with them to loosen trade restrictions.\n\nBut that is, of course, exactly what happened. Over the past year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang slowly won over Trump, eventually persuading him to let Nvidia sell the H200 — its second-most powerful chip — to the Chinese market, with the US government taking a 25 percent cut. With America’s most advanced chips flooding into a market known for brazen IP theft, Sullivan is deeply alarmed that AI companies are literally delivering the United States’ technological advantage to a country that openly wants to surpass America. But even though the AI arms race is often compared to the nuclear arms race during the Cold War, there’s one crucial difference. The government funded nuclear research for the primary purpose of national defense, but tech companies are funding AI research for the primary purpose of making untold amounts of money. “Maybe that was a failure of imagination on my part,” admitted Sullivan.\n\nBelow, Sullivan and I have wide-ranging conversation about the current state of Trump’s AI policy, the lessons that Nvidia should take away from Tesla’s failures in the Chinese market, what he would have done if DeepSeek had been unveiled while he was still National Security Advisor, and — given that it was barely a day since the United States’ shocking abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro — if the Trump administration would cite increased AI data center power consumption as a pretext for seizing Venezuela’s oil industry. (His assessment: “I would not put it past them.”)\n\nThis week at The Verge:\n\n“[I]n the short term, they will be able to book more orders. In the long term, they are contributing to a competitor that is going to squeeze them over time.”\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTina Nguyen: You’ve spent years warning about the risks of China overtaking America in the AI race. But then Trump comes in, rolls back the entirety of Biden’s AI executive order, and makes America’s AI policy friendlier to the industry. Republicans in Congress and the White House would argue that lifting regulations on trade and development would achieve the same goal of beating China in the AI race. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nJake Sullivan: Well, one of the most important moves that we made during the Biden administration was to impose export controls on the sale of advanced chips to China for use for training of frontier AI models. And the fact that President Trump is now permitting the sale of some of these chips, in particular the H200, is just a gift to China, whose main constraint at the moment is not power, not money, not talent. It’s chips. And we are now basically filling that hole for them. I see no way in which that could possibly be anything other than an advantage to China, in the race between the US and China at the frontier of AI.\n\nAnd it goes beyond just the frontier, because the compute constraint for China also goes to their ability to serve their models globally — to become the AI backbone upon which the world runs. Prior to this decision, China was having trouble building data centers outside of China because they couldn’t produce enough of their own chips to do so. Now, they can have Tencent and Alibaba and other companies essentially building data centers using American chips to serve Chinese models to the rest of the world.\n\nI do not see how that works on anyone’s terms to benefit the United States — and especially on the terms set out by David Sacks and Donald Trump, who want to see the world run on an American technology stack.\n\nA couple days ago, the US announced that it would allow TSMC to import US-made equipment into their Chinese factories. I believe the argument they’re making is, “Oh, we’re basically using American technology to manufacture chips in China.”\n\nIn general, my view is that export controls, both on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on the most advanced AI chips, is necessary to protect America’s national security and advance America’s edge, vis-a-vis China in AI. And I don’t believe that it will come at a long-term commercial cost to the United States, because the demand for this equipment and the demand for these chips is so great that there will be a growing market in the rest of the world for American firms, whether it’s Nvidia or one of the American chip equipment makers. So I don’t buy the argument that we have to allow them to sell some of the most advanced technology into China to make sure that they can earn sufficient returns to continue to grow their companies.\n\nJust to give you one example: Nvidia, in 2022, objected to the export controls that we put into place and said, If you put these export controls on the A100 and the H100 chips, we are going to lose a lot of money. At that point, Nvidia’s market cap, I believe, was south of $400 billion. Fast forward three years: Those controls have been in place the whole time and Nvidia’s market cap is now in the multiple trillions of dollars.\n\nIt’s the most valuable company in the world at this point.\n\nExactly. And why? Because the demand outside of China is so great, and will continue to be great long into the future. So I have a real concern about the willingness of this administration to trade very short-term commercial gains for what I think will be a long-term cost. History over the course of the past few decades has been littered with cases of American companies wanting to sell into China to make immediate profits, only to learn later that once China mastered the technology and then poured money into the industry, [the companies] ended up getting screwed over time.\n\nI mean, that’s basically what happened to electric vehicles, right?\n\nExactly. The idea had been that Tesla and Elon Musk thought, Get me a foothold into the Chinese market. Play nice with the Chinese government. This will give me access to a billion-plus people, and at the end of the day, it will help Tesla.\n\nLogically, there’s some basis to believe that. But the life of policy is not logic, but experience. And experience has taught us repeatedly that what happens is: We go into the Chinese market. The Chinese find ways to essentially use the presence of the US there — whether through technology transfer, outright theft, or just brutal competition — and end up surpassing, and then ultimately evicting, the American tech or the American product from their market. We saw that happen with electric vehicles. I think we’re going to end up seeing it with respect to these advanced AI compute technologies, because China is determined — and has said this from the very top for many years, long before these export controls were ever put into place — that they intend to end their dependence on American chip technology, and to try to become a major competitor to American chip technology globally.\n\n“[T]hey can have Tencent and Alibaba and other companies essentially building data centers using American chips to serve Chinese models to the rest of the world”\n\nSo what you’re saying is that the companies themselves will also see a long-term detrimental effect from selling to China?\n\nMy view is that in the short term, they will be able to book more orders. In the long term, they are contributing to a competitor that is going to squeeze them over time. I can’t make exact predictions about the future, and I’m not sitting in these boardrooms and I’m not seeing exactly what’s happening. But I would just say we have seen many, many examples of companies thinking that this is going to be a long-term success story, only to find ultimately that their entry into the Chinese market hurt their capacity over time.\n\nNow, one thing I will note in particular. I think Nvidia is looking at chip demand globally and has a concern that it now has competition outside of China: Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium, potential other entrants into the GPU market. And so it’s thinking, What do we do about this? Part of their answer to that threat, that some of the other hyperscalers in particular will not be sourcing Nvidia chips in the future, is to think: We need the Chinese market for this reason. I see that logic. I ultimately have questions about whether that will work for Nvidia. But what I know for certain is that it will not work for the United States of America, from our national security and national interest perspective, to allow Nvidia to sell these advanced chips to China.\n\nI was reading an interview that you did with Time magazine last year, and you mentioned that during your time in the White House, you ran a war room simulation about the China/US AI race. To the extent that you’re able to talk about it, did you ever run a scenario where the private sector’s interests won out over government?\n\nI confess that we did not factor in the possibility that we would actually be rolling back our export controls. We were operating scenarios presuming continuity of the export control policy. Now maybe that was a failure of imagination on my part, but having seen the first Trump administration — where they actually pursued a policy consistent with what the Biden administration very much built up on and expanded in our time in office — I was not expecting to see this administration come in and make these moves. And frankly, it’s come as something of a surprise to me. I think it’s come as a surprise not just to critics of the Trump administration, but many [of his] supporters in Congress, Republicans in Congress, who are stunned to have seen the Trump administration making moves along these lines.\n\nNow that you’re a private citizen, could you possibly game out the results of this scenario?\n\nThere’s a few things happening now that deeply concern me. We’ve just talked about the chip controls issue, both with respect to the chips and to the manufacturing equipment that makes the chips.\n\nThe second thing that concerns me is the private sector. Many elements of the private sector are saying to the Trump administration, Get entirely out of the game of safety and security alignment issues. We want a regulation-free, completely laissez-faire, let-’er-rip approach. And that has been reflected in the public statements and the public policy of the Trump administration. My concern is that we may end up in a circumstance in which China is dominating the global conversation over standards, with the United States virtually absent from the table. I think that is another area in which China could actually seek gains in its ability to become a dominant global AI player, where the United States is simply absenting itself, in part, at the behest of a private sector saying, Hey, the government shouldn’t be involved in this whole question of standards or regulation or safety or the like.\n\nThe third area that concerns me is when it comes to the question of talent and America’s ability to attract the best talent from around the world. This administration is taking a series of steps that is putting up a “not welcome” sign. It is going to make it harder for us to get the very best engineers and very best minds when it comes to AI going forward. I think that that is going to put us at a disadvantage as well.\n\nAnd then the final area is: America’s long-term innovation edge has always been built on basic research, and this administration is slashing the budget for basic research. I think that that is problematic because if you rely entirely on the private sector to do all of your innovation, they can do amazing things, and our AI companies have done amazing things, and I have huge respect for the breakthroughs that they have made. But you also need research at universities, with National Science Foundation grants, that are looking not for a commercial advantage, but just for very basic scientific breakthroughs. It is that kind of research that ultimately leads to the greatest revolutions over time. Slashing that money and relying entirely on, basically, the big technology companies to do the work for innovation — I think [this] is problematic from the point of view of the US. It is disrupting a formula that has worked for us time and time again over multiple decades.\n\nOne of the things I focus on is Trump’s transactionalism with Big Tech, and what he wants from AI companies in return for doing them this massive regulatory favor. You’re seeing OpenAI’s leaders donate to MAGA super PACs that boost him and his candidates. Now Trump is asking them to prevent “woke AI,” attacking Colorado’s approach to prevent algorithmic discrimination. What are your thoughts about the AI industry itself becoming partisan?\n\nI think it’s dangerous for any industry to wear the jersey of one political party or the other. When I was national security adviser, I worked hard to have good relationships with the leaders of all the major frontier AI companies. I think I succeeded in doing that, even though it was obviously widely reported that there were tensions between the administration and many of those companies. I think it’s important for senior government officials to develop good relationships, to understand where these companies are coming from. These companies are, in my view, a national asset of the United States. It is good that we have the most cutting-edge technology companies in the world, but it is also right and proper for the US government to ensure that there are proper regulations, norms, guardrails in place, both to protect the safety of Americans and to protect our national security.\n\nIf an entire industry decides we’re going all in with one administration or one political party, or cutting deals, both political and financial, with an administration, it worries me that that is going to end up eroding what is one of America’s greatest strengths, which is that we don’t have this kind of entanglement of the private sector with our government, in ways that other countries have seen and have suffered from. So I would hope that the technology industry would think about the long term, and about the need to have good relationships with political actors across the spectrum, and to stay out of trying to make big bets on what exactly is going to happen in American politics, since none of us can can predict that, by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nSo this is a bit of a hypothetical, but if you had still been national security adviser when DeepSeek was unveiled, what would have your response been?\n\nI think that the Chinese government actually played a role in hyping the DeepSeek release in order to send a message through their propaganda, relentlessly — and sadly, somewhat effectively — to voices in the West, basically saying: Resistance is futile. Your export controls cannot work. Give up on them. The whole chip strategy has not succeeded. That is what they tried to do. And that is nonsense.\n\nYou know how we know that is nonsense? If I had still been national security adviser, I would have been pointing this out at every chance I got: DeepSeek’s CEO himself has repeatedly said that their main constraint is chips. Their main constraint is compute. What has made it difficult for them since that release at the beginning of last year, to continue to march forward at the pace they want to march forward, is they have not had access to high-end American GPUs. President Trump is now making it easier for them.\n\nI would have been stressing that there is more hype here about what this means for America’s compute advantage than there is reality. And in fact, the DeepSeek release, in a way, reinforced the need for effective, enforced, and in some instances, expanded American export controls when it comes to high-end GPUs.\n\n“I think it’s dangerous for any industry to wear the jersey of one political party or the other”\n\nDo you think the Trump administration has done anything right in the AI race against China?\n\nWell, first, I think they have put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the AI revolution that we’re in the midst of. I think they have properly recognized that this is an incredibly important moment. They have put a lot of high-level policy attention behind it. They are not neglecting it. I think the choices they’re making aren’t great, but I’m glad to see them elevating and prioritizing the issue.\n\nSecond, they have largely abandoned the safety agenda. I think it is wrong and history will judge it as having been wrong. But one area where the AI Action Plan did, in fact, continue the Biden administration’s approach, was on safety when it comes to the risk of bio-uplift: the potential for convergence between AI and bioweapons in ways that could harm the security of the American people and people everywhere around the world. So I think that that has been a good thing for them too. And there have been these interesting initiatives like the Pax Silica, an effort to work with some friends and partners of the United States on chip technology, on other aspects of AI science and tech. I think that work is valuable work and should continue, and I want to see a further doubling down on engaging with allies, friends, partners in Europe, Asia, and other places as we go forward.\n\nBut [overall], I think the administration has taken steps to reduce America’s innovation edge, increase China’s access to advanced compute, and erode America’s leadership role in terms of the standard setting necessary for being the global leader on AI. So I don’t have a very good story to tell, I’m afraid, although some of these steps, I think, deserve praise.\n\nGiven how rapidly the situation is changing, I only have one Venezuela question, but I do want to loop it into the context of AI data centers and energy consumption. The International Energy Agency projects that by 2030, the US’ total energy consumption is going to rise by 10 percent, probably more, due to the demand for AI data centers. Forty percent of it is likely going to come from fossil fuels. What are things to keep in mind as Venezuela gets taken over by America and possibly has its oil seized?\n\nFirst, the idea that we would engage in military action, with the primary purpose appearing to be increasing preferential access for American oil companies to a foreign country’s oil — that, I find disturbing, and frankly, a little bit bizarre.\n\nThe chief issue that I see in the United States right now, when it comes to the power necessary for the AI revolution going forward, is about creating generation and transmission capability and improving our grid. It’s not about pumping more oil out of the ground. And frankly, China’s gotten the memo that the Trump administration has completely refused to read. Over time, the [dropping] price point of clean energy — including solar and other forms of clean energy technology — [is] going to mean that, as this goes forward, betting big on heavy crude from Venezuela as part of an answer to an AI energy challenge? I must say, I don’t find that particularly convincing. I haven’t heard them make that argument, but I don’t think it holds a lot of water.\n\nIt seems like something they would totally just throw out there.\n\nI would not put it past them.\n\nAnd now, Recess.\n\nIf you want a nice, relaxing change of pace, my suggestion is that you go read our live coverage of CES this week.

Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.\n\nAmazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.\n\nOn the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.\n\nRazer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko\n\nIn the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.\n\nThen there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.\n\nLego Smart Bricks mark the company’s first CES appearance\n\nLego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with the debut sets both having a Star Wars theme.

According to Motorola, the Android watch offers up to 13 days of battery life, alongside Polar-powered health tracking, open-source software, and dual-frequency GPS — a combination that helps set it apart from Apple’s and Google’s flagship wearables.\n\nBattery life is easily its most notable feature. Motorola says the 47mm watch can last up to 13 days on a single charge, or around seven days with the always-on OLED display enabled. If those claims hold up, it would put the Moto Watch well ahead of rivals like the Apple Watch Series 11, Google Pixel Watch 4, and even Fitbit’s Charge 6, which typically last a day or two with always-on displays turned on.\n\nThe Moto Watch offers an always-on OLED display and a 47mm case. Image: Motorola\n\nMotorola is also taking a different approach to health and fitness by partnering with Polar, the company behind the world’s first wireless heart rate monitor. Through Polar, the Moto Watch offers dual-frequency GPS, which should result in more accurate location and distance tracking outdoors — a feature more commonly found on sport-focused watches. While Google recently added it to the Pixel Watch 4, it’s still missing from the Apple Watch Series 11.\n\nOn the tracking front, the Moto Watch covers familiar fitness basics like steps, distance, continuous heart rate, and sleep tracking, while adding extra context around those metrics. Features like Nightly Recharge look at how your body handled stress overnight and suggest whether you should take it easy the next day or push harder. Activity Score shows how intense or effective a workout was compared to your goals, while Smart Calories break down how much energy you burned during workouts and across the day — including the types of energy your body relied on. You also get wellness tools like hydration and medication reminders.\n\nImage: Motorola\n\nSoftware is another key differentiator. Unlike most Android-compatible smartwatches, the Moto Watch doesn’t run Wear OS. Instead, it relies on open-source software, though Motorola hasn’t yet shared many details about what that experience looks like in practice.\n\nDurability is another area where the Moto Watch stands out: it carries an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, putting it on par with the Pixel Watch 4 and giving it an edge over the Apple Watch Series 11 for outdoor use.\n\nThe Moto Watch also offers all the smartwatch essentials. You can take calls directly from your wrist thanks to a built-in microphone and speaker, receive notifications over Bluetooth, and store music offline.\n\nThe wearable is set to arrive on January 22nd.

It has a flexible OLED display that expands horizontally — as opposed to Lenovo’s ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, which rolls up and down. The Legion Pro Rollable’s screen goes from a conventional 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio to an extra-wide 21.5 inches, all the way to an ultrawide 24 inches. That’s even bigger (diagonally, at least) than the ridiculous $9,000 21-inch gaming laptop Acer once made.\n\nThe Pro Rollable concept is based on the Legion Pro 7i, and it’ll come with an Intel Core Ultra processor and Nvidia’s flagship RTX 5090 Laptop GPU. There are no specifics yet on RAM or storage options.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 6 Standard 16-inch mode. Alright, let’s roll out!\n\nLenovo envisions this concept appealing to esports professionals who need to train on the go, which is why it’s branded the laptop’s 16-inch, 21.5-inch, and 24-inch settings as “Focus Mode,” “Tactical Mode,” and “Arena Mode.” (Because everything needs branding.) But it seems like a cool laptop idea for just about anyone who covets maximum screen real estate without lugging around a portable monitor.\n\nFrankly, as much as I loved the vertical rolling screen of last year’s ThinkBook, this is the direction I’ve been wanting. And based on reader comments, I think a sizable number of you agree with me. Fortunately, Lenovo has a pretty good track record of bringing concept laptops to market. It already released one rollable, and this year the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist is also moving beyond the concept stage. So I went into my CES demo with high hopes.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n1 / 3 Here’s the Legion Pro Rollable next to a conventional 16-inch laptop.\n\nAfter seeing it in action, however, I can say that this is very much a capital-C Concept. The motors were noisy, and the screen sometimes stuttered as it rolled and unrolled. The display resolution was stuck in its 24-inch ultrawide setting, regardless of the actual screen position, so in the 16-inch and 21.5-inch modes, it only showed the center of a larger area. The lid had a massive gap on its sides where the extra screen segments are stored, big enough to see the underside of the RGB logo on the lid. There weren’t even any games installed to test. But while all this tempered my enthusiasm a bit, it’s still a very cool concept. Just one that needs a lot more time in the oven.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n1 / 3 Look at that panel gap.\n\nAs much as I want this laptop to come out — and I’m dying to review it if it does — it’s already got me yearning for a rollable desktop monitor.

Or one that started at 32 inches and went really big — like Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 or Dell 52-inch 6K big.\n\nI can dream.\n\nPhotography by Antonio G.

It’s a 16-inch gaming laptop with a screen that can expand horizontally to a 21.5-inch “Tactical” mode, or all the way up to a 24-inch “Arena” mode. Let’s be real: a screen much wider than the laptop housing it looks wacky. And it requires the laptop lid to be comically thick.\n\nBut with the popularity of ultrawide external monitors for gaming, it does make a certain amount of sense. A 24-inch screen coming from the footprint of a 16-inch laptop is pretty awesome especially if you’re someone who wants to take their gaming laptop on the go, whether while traveling or even just from one part of your house to another. Like the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable OLED laptop that came out last year, the full OLED screen is hidden until triggered to unroll with a key press. In this case, the laptop uses two motors that unrolls the screen in both directions simultaneously, giving you that ultrawide aspect ratio when fully expanded. Beyond that, it's built on the chassis of a Legion Pro 7i, so in theory a laptop like this would feature high-end components similar to what's in that model, like RTX 5090 graphics and the latest Intel processors.\n\nGoing Up\n\nLenovo has also announced the ThinkPad Rollable XD Concept, which iterates on its previous rollable design that expands the screen vertically. It still starts with smaller OLED display (this time a 13.3-inch screen) and can be expanded up to 16 inches with one keystroke. This is an even more dramatic transformation than last year's ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, which starts at a 14-inch size before growing.\n\nThe back of the lid shows some screen too. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The screen expanded.\n\nRather than hiding the extra screen real estate rolled up under the hinge, this new concept gives you use of it on the lid. Lenovo calls this a “world-facing” screen, but it's not clear exactly what the use case for this additional display area would be. The demo unit had some placeholder widgets but nothing that functioned yet.\n\nThis is not Lenovo’s first exploration of putting screens on the lid, but so far they have been always-on, digital-ink screens that only sip power and don't tax the battery too much. I do like the look of this design better, especially being able to see the screen wrap around the top. The problem is that it requires the webcam to sit over on the side, kind of like on an iPad. Definitely not an ideal spot for video calls.\n\nBoth of these rolling-screen computers are mere concepts at this point, but Lenovo has a track record of actually releasing some of these flashy tech concepts.\n\nLenovo is also announcing the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist. This was a concept we first saw a few years ago, which uses a motorized hinge to twist the screen around in either direction. This enables the device to follow you around a room during a video call and even transform into tablet mode just by using a voice command. It still feels like a bit of a work in progress, but it shows that these proof-of-concept projects are more than just novelties.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T02:13:10.810764"}

Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won’t confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time.\n\nWhat we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables.\n\nThe Razr Fold will be compatible with the new Moto Pen Ultra, an active stylus designed with the Fold in mind. This will at least set the Razr Fold apart from the competition. Samsung supported the S Pen stylus on several generations of its Z Fold line, but that ended with 2025’s Galaxy Z Fold 7.

As the world’s top PC maker by volume, Lenovo ships tens of millions of devices every year. What it decides to ship, bundle, and integrate can directly shape how AI shows up in many everyday lives.\n\nThat’s what made Lenovo’s announcement today at CES notable. At a flashy event on Tuesday at The Sphere in Las Vegas, it introduced Qira, a system-level, cross-device AI assistant designed to live across Lenovo laptops and Motorola phones. It’s Lenovo’s most ambitious AI effort to date and a rare look at how a hardware giant with global reach is thinking about integrating AI more deeply.\n\nJeff Snow, Lenovo’s head of AI product, told me how Qira came together, why the company is deliberately avoiding a single exclusive AI partnership, and what he learned from earlier experiments like Moto AI and Microsoft’s Recall debacle.\n\nQira emerged from a quiet but meaningful internal reorganization less than a year ago, according to Snow. Lenovo pulled AI teams out of individual hardware units such as PCs, tablets, and phones and centralized them into a new software-focused group that works across the entire company.\n\nFor a company long optimized around hardware SKUs and supply chains, the move signaled a shift toward putting AI more front and center. “We wanted a built-in cross-device intelligence that works with you throughout the day, learns from your interactions, and can act on your behalf,” Snow said. He mentioned using Qira’s on-device model during his flight to CES to help him workshop how to talk about the news in meetings based on the notes and documents on his PC.\n\n“We wanted a built-in cross-device intelligence that … learns from your interactions and can act on your behalf.”\n\nQira is not built around a single flagship AI model. Instead, it’s modular. Under the hood, it mixes local, on-device models with cloud-based models, anchored by Microsoft and OpenAI infrastructure accessed through Azure. Stability AI’s diffusion model is also integrated, along with tie-ins to app-specific partners like Notion and Perplexity.\n\n“We didn’t want to hard-code ourselves to one model,” Snow said. “This space is moving too fast. Different tasks need different tradeoffs around performance, quality, and cost.”\n\nThat stance runs counter to the push from major AI labs, many of which would happily become the exclusive intelligence layer for a company with Lenovo’s reach. Lenovo’s view is that optionality matters more, especially given its control over one of the largest consumer computing distribution channels in the world.\n\nSnow previously worked on Moto AI, Motorola’s assistant, which he said saw high initial engagement. More than half of Motorola users tried it, but retention wasn’t good. He said that too much of the experience felt like prompt-based chat features people could already get elsewhere.\n\n“That pushed us away from competing with chatbots,” Snow said. “Qira is about things chatbots can’t do, like continuity, context, and acting directly on your device.”\n\nCost pressures loom over all of this.\n\nLenovo also paid close attention to the backlash around Microsoft’s Recall feature. Snow said Qira is designed from the outset with opt-in memory, persistent indicators, and clear user controls. Context ingestion is optional. Recording is visible. Nothing is silently collected.\n\nCost pressures loom over all of this. Memory prices are rising as AI demand strains supply chains, and analysts expect PC prices to follow. Qira does not raise baseline system requirements for PCs, Snow said, but it performs best on higher-end machines with more RAM. Lenovo is working to bring local models down to smaller memory footprints, like 16 gigabytes of RAM, without watering down the experience.\n\nStrategically, Lenovo sees Qira as both a retention play and a hedge against hardware commoditization. In the short term, it hopes that tighter integration between laptops and phones will nudge customers to stay within the Lenovo ecosystem. Over the longer term, Snow framed Qira as a way to differentiate Lenovo devices when specs alone are no longer enough.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-06T21:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T03:48:34.577663"}

Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.\n\n“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.\n\nTaneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said.\n\nCalacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”\n\nCFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.\n\nAnother key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:09:04 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T03:48:34.944082"}

They appear assured that the deal is legitimate despite earlier misgivings about Benchmark’s investment in Manus. China’s regulators, however, are reportedly not quite as sanguine, according to the Financial Times.\n\nWhen Benchmark led a financing round for Manus earlier this year, the investment sparked immediate controversy. U.S. Senator John Cornyn complained about the deal on X, and the investment prompted inquiries from the U.S. Treasury Department around new rules restricting American investment in Chinese AI companies.\n\nThe concerns were significant enough to spur Manus’s eventual relocation from Beijing to Singapore — part of what drove the company’s “step-by-step disentanglement from China,” as one Chinese professor described it on WeChat this past weekend.\n\nNow the tables have turned. Chinese officials are reportedly reviewing whether the Meta deal violates technology export controls, potentially giving Beijing leverage it wasn’t initially perceived as having. Specifically, they’re examining whether Manus needed an export license when it relocated its core team from China to Singapore — a move that’s apparently now so common it has earned the nickname “Singapore washing.” A recent Wall Street Journal article speculated that China has “few tools to influence the deal given Manus’s foothold in Singapore,” but that assessment may have been premature.\n\nThe concern in Beijing is that this deal could encourage more Chinese startups to physically relocate to dodge domestic oversight. Winston Ma, a professor at New York University School of Law and partner at Dragon Capital, told the Journal that if the deal closes smoothly, “It creates a new path for the young AI startups in China.”\n\nHistory suggests Beijing could act. China previously used similar export control mechanisms to intervene in Trump’s attempted TikTok ban during his first term. The Chinese professor even warned on WeChat that Manus’ founders could face criminal liability if they exported restricted technology without authorization.\n\nMeanwhile, some U.S. analysts are calling the acquisition a win for Washington’s investment restrictions, arguing it shows Chinese AI talent is defecting to the American ecosystem. One expert told the FT that the deal demonstrates “the US AI ecosystem is currently more attractive.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Most smart lighting companies offer pre-designed scenes to help you light your space, but the lights don’t know where they are physically in your home, and the effect can get diluted. Philips Hue has a solution to this problem: SpatialAware.\n\nSpatialAware knows your room’s layout and the placement of your Hue lights, so it can determine the best way to distribute the scene’s colors and effects across them.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 Some of the newly remastered Hue lighting scenes designed to work with SpatialAware.\n\nIt gets the data when you scan your space with your smartphone in the Hue app. Using your phone’s AR capabilities, the system can create a 3D model of the placement of Hue lights in your room.\n\nThat’s then stored as a map in the Hue app, and when you apply one of Hue’s newly remastered scenes, it will distribute the light intelligently based on where bulbs and fixtures are.\n\nSo, for a sunset scene, for example, the lamps on one side of the room will show warm yellow tones to mimic the setting sun, while the ceiling lights on the opposite side will have darker tones and colors.\n\nThe company has reworked about half of its scenes to be compatible with the new technology, coding each to adapt to the new data on the lights’ placement.\n\nI saw a demo of SpatialAware in a hotel suite at CES this week, and it made me realise I’ve been using smart lighting wrong all along.\n\nHeld in a dining room filled with Hue ambient lighting products and Hue bulbs in overhead can lighting, the demo showed the original scene, then the remastered scene.\n\nAs you can see in the video above, the lighting is distributed in a more polished and integrated way in the remastered version. “That’s because it’s actually being done the way the lighting designer intended,” says George Yianni, CTO and founder of Philips Hue.\n\nThe most noticeable difference is that the colors are more evenly distributed. For example, all the ceiling lights in the remastered Savannah sunset scene are a soft orange glow, whereas in the original, a couple are orange and a couple soft white, which creates an awkward look.\n\nIn the Nightlight scene, the original version has the ceiling lights on, but the remastered one turns them all off, “because you don’t want ceiling lights on in a night light scene,” says Yianni.\n\nThe new feature is coming in Spring 2026 and is compatible with Hue lighting connected to the Hue Bridge Pro.\n\nPhotos and video by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T03:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T08:39:01.465350"}
{"title": "The Best Cat Toys for Your Furry Friend (2026)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/best-cat-toys/", "summary": "Based on years of testing with our cats, these are our favorite WIRED-approved, techy cat toys and furniture.", "content": "Cats are beautiful, interesting, weird creatures. They’re also very picky. Finding cat toys that they'll actually play with is tough, especially with the oversaturation of the pet market today. Cats require a specific environment to play, scratch, and relax. Based on years of testing with our cats, these are our favorite WIRED-approved, techy cat toys (and furniture). Even if our cats rejected a particular product, we still examined overall construction, design, and value to determine whether it may be useful for other kitties.\n\nWe have tested everything on this list with our own cats. All of these toys have an element to engage their natural instincts, like an interactive mat that mimics the movements of prey or a puzzle toy so your cat has to use their pecan-sized brain to get rewarded with delicious treats. Plus, increasing vertical space with cat furniture is a great way to provide passive enrichment.\n\nI'm a helicopter cat mom specializing in pet tech, and all of the cat toys and furniture in this guide are approved by my and other staffers’ (very spoiled) WIRED cats. Check out our other pet-related guides like the Best Automatic Cat Litter Boxes, Best Automatic Cat Feeders, Best Cat Water Fountains, and Our Favorite Fancy Cat Furniture. More of a dog person? We've got you covered! See our guide to the Best Accessories and Tech Essentials for Your Dog.\n\nUpdated January 2025: We've added the Potaroma Flapping Bird and Lesure Cat Tunnel Bed and updated prices and links throughout.\n\nCat Toys\n\nThis feline crowd pleaser is the cat toy I recommend everyone buy. My extremely spoiled cats rarely interact with a toy for more than five minutes, but they play with this interactive cat toy for hours on end. It has three modes so cats never get bored: Normal, Active, and Interactive, and it shuts off automatically after a period of time not being used. It has a simple USB charger (but lasts on a charge for about six days), and a button that controls everything, plus it comes with a replacement wand in case your cats are as rough-and-tumble as mine. Although this is a bit more than I like to spend on cat toys, it was the best purchase I've made this year.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nChevron Chevron Viwik Interactive Cat Toy Mat $13 Amazon\n\nMy cats go bonkers for interactive play mats, and although this one didn't keep their attention as much as the play mat above, it's still a solid choice and provides them with options when it comes to human-free play. The rechargeable rolling ball lights up and moves erratically inside the mat, which held my cats' attention for probably half an hour. I put this one away for a few days before bringing it back out to keep interest. You can even use the rolling ball as a toy outside the mat, but beware that it easily rolls under furniture and in hard-to-reach corners. My biggest gripe is that the rechargeable ball has a short battery life and needs to be charged after each play session.\n\nThere's some controversy in the cat-owning community about whether lasers are too frustrating for cats, who may feel like they can never “catch” the “prey” (aka pouncing on the laser dot without actually being able to get it). My cats are both obsessed with laser toys, and it's a great way for them to get exercise and keep themselves entertained; I just always give them treats after to reward them for a job well done. This toy has three interactive modes and motion sensor activation to further keep cats' attention, and it lasts about a day before needing to be recharged.\n\nOne of my cats is an extremely intelligent, high-energy cat who's also very food motivated, so it is a continual challenge to find things to keep him entertained—not to mention, I also have to make sure he doesn't inhale his food. With this toy, you can cover up the treats with the leaves or put them only in the cups for an extra challenge—I love that this puzzle toy is totally customizable based on your cat’s intelligence level. I have both the Melon Madness and Buggin’ Out models, and even years later, my cats are still entertained by them. I call that a good investment.\n\nCourtesy of Meowbox Meowbox Subscription Box $28 Meowbox\n\nIf you can't figure out which kind of toy your cats will like, or you just want them to be refreshed every so often, former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano thought Meowbox was a great subscription. You can choose to get deliveries every one or two months, and they include both treats and incredibly cute toys with an equally cute theme. Plus, for every box sold, the company gives food to a shelter.\n\nFormer WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano's cats went nuts for this Ripple Rug. The bottom piece stays in place while the top can be configured into different shapes for playing (or hunting), and you can reshape it as often as you wish. The material feels like felt, but is made from 24 post-consumer plastic bottles and can withstand sharp claws.\n\nAll three of our cats love the Kong Kickeroo, and it has been one of the most long-lived cat toys we have ever bought. Bodhi is our eldest cat and rarely plays with toys anymore, but even he can’t resist the Kickeroo. It’s the perfect shape to grab and claw at with his back paws, and it has a tail, mixed textures, and crinkly material inside with a touch of catnip. We also tried the smaller model, but it was quickly chewed through, while the larger one has lasted for years. —Simon Hill\n\nThis rechargeable, interactive toy realistically chirps and flaps its wings to help engage your cat's curiosity and natural hunting instincts. It's motion-activated, so when your pet paws at it, it'll automatically start flapping and chirping in 10-second intervals. Initially, my cats were super interested in and perplexed by (and maybe a little afraid of?) this loud, sort of chaotic toy. But it kept their attention, and eventually they were brave enough to bat it around. Plus, its tail is made of feathers, and my cat Clover loved to hold it and lick the feathers. (Why? No idea, but God forbid a woman has hobbies.) The battery lasts ridiculously long, so I only need to recharge it every few weeks via the included USB cord.\n\nMy overactive cat Basil is one of roughly 40 percent of cats that don't react to catnip, which is a bummer because he gets FOMO watching his sister go wild. Luckily, both of my cats go crazy for these simple sticks. It helps them engage with natural kicking instincts and redirects aggressive chewing from my iPhone cord. I'd recommend that anyone with cats who don't react to catnip or have aggressive chewing tendencies give these a try.\n\nI’ve had seven cats over the past 20 years, and every single one of them has been obsessed with this interactive toy. And not just any wand toy, this one specifically and its original feather attachment, which uses the same swivel mechanism as a fishing lure to create movement through the air that registers as 100 percent authentic to cats. There are other attachments available, like fur “mice,” but nothing hits quite like the original feather cluster. Make sure you stock up on refills, in case your cat finds the wand in the middle of the night and has its way with it. (Speaking from experience.) —Kat Merck\n\nThis pet camera has the ability to control a laser via app, so you can engage in play with your cat even when away, and it aims to auto-engage when motion is detected (but very often it didn't). Although I wish the motion sensors were a bit more sensitive to engage in play more often while I'm not home, it consistently kept my cats entertained, plus it was fun to be able to play with them through the app from afar.\n\nIs it a toy? Is it a security camera? Is it a treat dispenser? There's no need to decide! While my cats were more curious than excited to play with this li'l robot pet camera, it did keep their attention, which is a win in my book. My cat Basil was obsessed with the toy attachment and loved finding different ways to proudly pull it off and bring it to me. The app can be a bit glitchy, and the robot is by no means smart, but it is a camera you can move about your house while you're away, and it'll roll, slam into objects, and shoot treats out at your confused cats. At the end of the day, the robot was great at keeping their attention, which is all we really want in the end.\n\nCat Trees and Furniture\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck Omlet Freestyle Indoor Cat Tree Shop at Omlet\n\nMore than just a cat tree, the modular Freestyle lets you customize your own indoor or outdoor cat jungle gym from a series of bamboo platforms, beds, ramps, hammocks, and scratchers. The platforms are sturdy enough to support cats of any size or activity level, and the poles can accommodate ceilings up to 14 feet. The system is not inexpensive or especially easy to put together, but my cats Circe and Scylla spend every single day on theirs, making it worth the investment. —Kat Merck\n\nThis is one of the most popular items I have ever tested with my cats. Neighbors love it, delivery people comment on it, and, of course, both my cats adore it. It’s super easy to assemble and install, provided you have a vertical sash window—just close the window on it, and raised acrylic stakes in the back will keep it in place. (You also have the option to screw the Purrgola to the window frame, which is recommended, and/or secure the window in place with window locks.) The thick, weatherproof acrylic—which is seriously thick; it even survived a tumble out of a first-story window during our test—is load-tested to 90 pounds, and the cushion inside has a soft, minky, machine-washable cover. The screens on either side are stainless steel mesh to prevent any funny business. It’s got an acrylic door on the room side that pulls out and down to close, but this part is fragile; I’ve now broken it twice taking it in and out of the window, but it glues back just fine. I wouldn’t recommend using a Purrgola during a very rainy season, as a little heavy rain will come in the side screens (though not a lot, and the makers say covers for the screens will be available soon), or where there are lots of bugs, as it’s not an airtight fit in the window. However, if your cats are indoor-only (and they should be!), this is a fun and stylish way for them to interact safely with the outdoors. Also note that it may take cats a while to get used to it—it took both of mine about a week, but after that, they were both in it every day. —Kat Merck\n\nNo one does high-end cat furniture quite like Mau. WIRED has tested several of Mau’s cat trees over the years, and every one has been a banger: objectively beautiful, sturdy, well made, and beloved by cats. The solid-oak Reiya isn’t one of Mau’s flashier designs, and in fact, I’m surprised by how unassuming it looks online—in person, it reads as a midcentury work of art, Hans Wegner-esque with rounded edges and a glowing oak finish. Everyone who visits our house has commented on it. I admit I was a little worried about the baskets being clawed or unraveled, but they’re plastic rattan. The woolly Oeko-Tex cushion covers zip off for washing, and for younger, more playful kitties, there are rings on the underside of the top platform for dangling white, green, or pink optional pom poms ($12). The scratching pad is the hard kind of sisal material, which my cats don’t love, but they quickly warmed up to it with some training. In any case, a Mau cat tree is an investment, but you get what you pay for, and this is likely the last cat tree you will need to buy in your lifetime. If you’re not sure, Mau offers a 45-day trial period and one-year warranty. —Kat Merck\n\nIt's pretty clear that the WIRED reviews team loves Mau furniture. It's sleek, well made, and looks like a high-end piece of furniture rather than the ugly, cheaply made cat trees of yesteryear. This piece is solid, with a heavy wood base, two sturdy sisal-rope-lined trunk pieces that screw together, three woven baskets that screw into place, and three super-soft fur pillows. Plus, all of the pieces are replaceable, so that if something succumbs to wear and tear over time, you won't have to throw away the entire tree. The fur cushions are machine washable too, but make sure you read the cleaning directions to ensure they last as long as possible. Mau has free shipping (in the contiguous US and Canada), a 45-day return policy, and a one-year warranty. My cats use this tree every day, and I'm happy to have this stylish piece proudly on display in my living room.\n\nCats like to jump and climb whatever they can, so a cat tree should help keep them occupied and off your mantel or breakable glassware. Our favorite cat trees are made from materials that can be scratched up. (We also have a guide to the fanciest cat furniture we've tried if you really want the full scoop.) When you live in a small apartment, everything you decorate with matters because it's all on display—nothing gets hidden when you only have one to three rooms. Some of us want our cat's furniture to match, too. Mau's Cento is one of former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano's favorites. If you can afford it, your cats will thank you.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck Mau Kona End Table Scratcher $399 Mau\n\nMau is known for its high-end and tasteful cat furniture (including our Mau picks above), and its Kona side table fits right into the lineup with a midcentury mod vibe and scratching pad discreetly tucked into the back. The solid-wood table is very heavy and well-made, with options for an oak or walnut finish. It didn’t dissuade my cats from scratching the chair it’s next to, but it does come with a bag of catnip to help with encouragement. This table is popular and often sold out, but you can sign up on Mau’s website to be notified of the next restock. —Kat Merck\n\nOur favorite window perch lets cats responsibly interact with the outside world. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano loved these window seats because they are a great way for cats to bask in the sun and keep a watchful eye on the neighborhood while safely indoors. They're easy to install, too, with sticky strips that attach to your windowsill and can hold up to 40 pounds. You can also nail the base into the window frame, and there are even heated seats for super-spoiled kitties. The covers are removable and can be machine-washed. Heads up, you'll need a windowsill at least 2 inches deep to properly support it. Note: Temporarily out of stock on Amazon, but we expect a restock soon.\n\nThis cat bed has a memory foam sculpted-contour mattress base with a super cozy (removable and washable) nano heating and volcanic-particle-infused cover. It has a button on the side with different heat settings, including timed heatings. It has optional self-heating natural herb pad attachments for further pain relief and to help reduce arthritic inflammation, which is especially ideal for senior cats. The sculpted bed is specially contoured to provide orthopedic support for the cat's joints. Pro tip: Put the bed on a higher surface or somewhere the cats already lounge. Cats love to be off the ground, and once I moved this on top of my side desk, both of my cats lay in it constantly.\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nCourtesy of Lesure Chevron Chevron Lesure Cat Tunnel Bed $43 Amazon\n\nThese stylish cat beds double as a tunnel with a cozy bed in the center. One of my cats is a little freak who finds any tiny, enclosed space irresistible, so she loves hiding from her rambunctious brother in the tunnel or curling up in the middle. The tunnel comes in a variety of cute colors and patterns, and arrives flat: All you need to do is form the doughnut and zip the ends together—it springs into shape. The cushion comes in the package separately and attaches to the tunnel with elastic loops. In all, setup took less than five minutes. It's quite large, so make sure you have enough space for it, but it's versatile enough to be a lounge place, and my cats love when I play with the laser pointer and let them chase the dot through the tunnel. Plus, each opening has a hanging fluff ball they like to bat and kick. One zipper broke about three months into testing, and I've had to safety-pin it together to keep it in doughnut form (but I still think it's a solid combo lounge-play cat accessory).\n\nI've been getting Instagram ads for this stylish bed that attaches to your desk for so long, I had to cave and see if it was worth the hype. Especially since I have a very needy cat who loves to lounge on my laptop while I WFH. This bed is easy to assemble, with an arm that screws into the wooden base and a screwed vise to keep the bed in place on the desk. It has adjustable vertical height, and the base also rotates. Just make sure you measure the surface you want to attach it to before you buy. My desk was too thick, and my side table was too thin—luckily, they sent additional planks to add into the screwed vise to make it sturdier, but I haven't found the purrfect spot for it yet.\n\nOther Essentials We Keep Going Back To\n\nUproot Cleaner Pro Photograph: Molly Higgins\n\nUproot Cleaner Pro for $20: This simple tool is so satisfying to use.

Well, that’s exactly what a company called Dreame has developed, and I think it’s kind of a good idea — but maybe not for $700.\n\nThe device is also a lamp, so at least you won’t have to explain to people why you have a giant, standing hair dryer in your living room.\n\nPhoto by Victoria Song / The Verge\n\nOur very own Victoria Song braved the taint-zapping booth at CES 2026, which is exactly what it sounds like: a device that sends electrodes into a man’s perineum, with the goal of preventing premature ejaculation.\n\nThe device, called Mor, is attached to an adhesive patch containing electrodes that you, well, stick on your taint. And no, this isn’t vaporware — the starter pack is available for about $300.\n\nGIF: Glyde\n\nI’m not sure what’s scarier: a friend armed with clippers and exactly one YouTube tutorial, or putting AI in charge of your haircut.

Then, just turn them on and hope for the best.\n\nPhoto: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nDesktop anime girls made a comeback at CES 2026. This time around, Razer showed off its Project Ava pod, featuring a 5.5-inch hologram of the cat-ear-wearing anime waifu Kira, or the tattooed husbando, Zane. They’re supposed to look at you using a built-in camera (or your webcam) and can see what’s happening on your computer screen via the device’s USB-C connection to offer gaming tips. The avatars are powered by xAI’s Grok (ew), and you can chat with them using the pod’s dual-mic array.\n\nL’Oréal’s creepy LED mask\n\nNo, this isn’t a prop from The Silence of the Lambs; this is L’Oréal’s LED Face Mask. The flexible, silicone mask looks like another layer of skin, complete with red lights that highlight a veinlike pattern. L’Oréal claims its face mask tightens and smooths skin using targeted red light and near-infrared light. The company expects to launch the LED Mask in 2027.\n\nA company called Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter (TDM) is launching Neo over-ear headphones that you can transform into a speaker by folding in the flexible headband. Along with 40mm drivers on the inside of the Neo’s ear cups, the device offers a separate pair of 40mm drivers that activate when using speaker mode.\n\nTDM’s Neo headphones are launching as part of a Kickstarter campaign and will cost $249.\n\nImage: Jackery\n\nThe home battery company Jackery took the wraps off a solar-powered gazebo that looks more like an incomplete storage container than something that I’d want to put in my backyard. It comes equipped with 2,000W of solar panels, built-in lighting, a pull-down projector screen, and two AC outlets.\n\nWhat’s perhaps even more outrageous than the design is its price tag: it’s expected to cost anywhere between $12,000 and $15,000, not including battery storage.\n\nThe Chinese phone maker Honor offered a closer look at a non-working Robot Phone prototype during CES 2026, which comes with a camera mounted on a tiny gimbal that folds out from the back of the device. Based on a promo shared by Honor, the camera appears to move on its own and track subjects, but what else it can do will remain a mystery — at least until the company launches it at MWC 2026.\n\nPhoto: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nThis little bot may give you a better understanding of a day in the life of your pet while you’re not home. The bot is called Vex, and it’s built to follow your cat or dog around your house, capturing videos while it attempts to play with them. Vex will even edit the video itself by using AI to create “moving narratives and shareable stories.”\n\nIt’s an adorable concept — if it works. FrontierX, the bot’s manufacturer, hasn’t shared footage edited by Vex yet.\n\nThe health tech startup Vivoo has created a “smart” menstrual pad that’s designed to detect follicle-stimulating hormone, as high levels may suggest lower ovarian reserves, fertility issues, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The pads are pricey at $4 to $5 apiece, but they display results on the back, which users can snap a picture of using the Vivoo app for more information.\n\nPhoto: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nA $399 chef’s knife from Seattle Ultrasonics promises to cut with 50 percent less effort, thanks to piezoelectric ceramic crystals that vibrate more than 30,000 times per second.

The issues only impacted Mac users because macOS prevents certain applications from running if it doesn’t detect a valid Developer ID certificate, something that has affected other apps in the past.\n\nA patch has now been released to fix the issue, which needs to be manually installed “because the certificate also affected the in‑app updater.” Logitech says that the device settings, customizations, and profiles for impacted users will remain intact after installing the patch. This fix is available for devices running on macOS 26 Tahoe, macOS 15 Sequoia, macOS 14 Sonoma, and macOS 13 Ventura, with a fix for older versions of macOS coming “at a later time.”\n\n“We dropped the ball here. This is an inexcusable mistake,” Logitech spokesperson ATXsantucci said in response to user complaints on Reddit. “We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T07:10:34-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T12:57:50.357781"}

I heard from people concerned this was the death of imagination from a company that’s all about imagination — and from people who thought it sounded pretty cool!\n\nPersonally, I walked in skeptical. My kids loved Lego’s previous computer bricks, the Lego Mario toys, but don’t play with them for long because they’re predictable and fiddly to use! But I walked out with a grin on my face. These Smart Bricks are far smarter and more imaginative than I expected.\n\nThis isn’t like Lego Mario where scanning a barcode largely triggers a series of sound effects on cue. The new NFC smart tiles are effectively programs that tell the Smart Brick what kind of vehicle or character it now represents. Then, it starts reacting and interacting with other smart parts nearby.\n\nNow, I just wonder if Lego will take full advantage of its own creation.\n\nFor example, the most attention-grabbing thing you can do with Lego’s flagship set is have a lightsaber battle. Two Smart Bricks, two smart minifigs, smack them into each other and hear lightsabers hum and clash while Vader occasionally breathes ominously into his mask.\n\nThe second most attention-grabbing thing you can do is sit Emperor Palpatine upon his throne and hear The Imperial March play.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 8 Photo by Kevin McShane / The Verge\n\nIt’s good fun — but kind of obvious. You know what’s not obvious? Stand Vader next to his master next to the Smart Brick throne, and they’ll begin to have a conversation in an unintelligible language that still sounds like the characters. Your imagination fills in the gaps.\n\nOr, drop a Smart Brick on a Dewback, the scaly reptiles that Stormtroopers ride through the Tatooine desert, and you can stroke its tail with a fingertip and hear it react, as if brought to life by magic.\n\nPhoto by Kevin McShane / The Verge\n\nOr, place a Smart Brick in the Mos Eisley Cantina, that wretched hive of scum and villainy, and you can make a Lego-ified version of the Cantina Band music play as fast or slow as you like, by rocking the brick (and the musicians) back and forth while the brick’s real-time synthesizer produces sounds at your chosen speed. Put a smart minifig like Darth Vader in front of the mic, and they can contribute vocals too!\n\n(The Cantina and the Dewback seem to be part of a fourth unannounced Lego Smart Play set; I’m not sure about price and availability.)\n\nEven a dogfight between an X-Wing and Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter was more sophisticated than replacing the “pew-pew” and “whoosh” sounds that kids will readily make with their own mouths. As you blast away, you’ll “hit” your target if you’re close enough, see and hear the other craft’s Smart Brick take the hit, and eventually hear an explosion sound because it’s keeping score.\n\nThat’s me, Darth Vader, battling CNET’s Bridget Carey. Photo by Kevin McShane / The Verge\n\nThe most impressive demonstration I saw wasn’t Lego Star Wars or a confirmed set at all, though. Lego interaction designer Maria Salgado showed us how a little police car set could react to not only the presence of cop and robber smart minifigs, but where they are located compared to the Smart Brick.\n\nIf a robber approaches the car, it’ll sound the car alarm; if a cop approaches, he can unlock it with a beep. Drop the cop in the back seat, behind the Smart Brick, and he’ll start snoozing because he’s obviously not on the job; drop the robber into the front seat, and the cop will wake up shouting. Lego’s SVP of innovation, Tom Donaldson, tells me that each smart minifig is programmed with certain traits that dictate how they interact.\n\nHe says these Smart Bricks have been in active development for roughly six years. The big idea was that many existing playsets have several small models, like a car, a building, and a motorcycle, and the company wanted to make them feel like they interact instead of just having “one big central robotic element” at the set’s core.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 6 The 473-piece Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter set comes with one smart brick, one smart tag, and one smart minifigure. Image: Lego\n\nI was surprised to find the smaller Lego Star Wars spaceship sets actually can feel that way. I thought it might be a negative that Lego sacrificed the size and detail of the X-Wing so it could also include a tiny fuel truck, a scanner outpost, and a laser turret at that price, but it means you have a laser turret that can do battle with the X-Wing, a fuel truck that can audibly fuel the X-Wing, and fun scanning station sounds.\n\nThe X-Wing set is also a good demo of how not every Lego element needs to be smart to give you Smart Brick fun. The end of the fuel hose is just a standard round blue tile; once a brick decides it’s an X-Wing, its built-in color sensor can recognize blue as a signal to start the sound of fuel gurgling into the spacecraft.\n\nRefueling my X-Wing while filming part of the video you see embedded in this story. Photo by Kevin McShane / The Verge\n\nDonaldson also says the team knew the bricks needed to be wireless and spatially aware almost from the get-go, which allows for complex interactions like that police car scene — but he and others I speak to suggest that Lego doesn’t want to spend its time designing all sorts of specific interactions itself; they still want to let kids’ and adults’ imaginations do most of the work.\n\nThat’s probably what some parents and longtime Lego fans want to hear, but I’m not quite sure yet.\n\nI’d like to know I’ll be getting my money’s worth buying Smart Bricks, instead of them collecting dust like my kids’ Lego Mario toys usually do, particularly since these new ones don’t take standard AAA batteries that will almost certainly still be available decades from now. I want to know they’ll keep surprising us year after year, and Lego is absolutely not committing to that yet, even if it is dropping hints.\n\nSpeaking of batteries, I wonder how much their limited capacity might impact play. Salgado says the Smart Bricks should last for 45 minutes of intensive play, which seems like plenty, but the bricks put themselves to sleep very quickly when idle. You can just shake to wake them, but in our demo, they sometimes needed to be reintroduced to nearby smart tags and figures before they’d start working again.\n\nThe company claims the bricks can also sleep for years, though it recommends charging them every six months to be safe. You can plop two at a time on Lego’s wireless charger, which takes USB-C power, and I’ve emailed Lego to ask if it has a plan to let us replace the batteries as they age.\n\nI don’t think I’ll need to speculate long on whether Lego’s Smart Bricks are worth the money, though. This feels like the rare Lego product that The Verge will definitely want to review.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T07:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T12:57:50.547024"}

{"title": "Home Pilates Equipment for Studio-Quality Workouts (2026)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-best-pilates-at-home-equipment/", "summary": "Here’s everything that you should buy, skip, or splurge on for your at-home Pilates workout.", "content": "When Joseph Pilates developed what he first called Contrology in the early 20th century, there were no dedicated studios or intimidating contraptions. There wasn't even a reformer yet. (That came later, improvised from leather straps and hospital bed frames.) The idea was simple then, and it still is now: Pilates asks you to work with what you already have. Your body does the work, and a mat just makes it more comfortable.\n\nPilates is about moving with intention. Total body exercises are rooted in precision and balance, favoring slow, controlled movements over momentum or strength. Full range of motion, emphasizing time under tension, deep core engagement, and uniformity of mind, body, and spirit are emphasized. It sounds peaceful, but it's not exactly the easiest workout.\n\nThe right gear won't do the workout for you, but it can make it more comfortable, more effective, and frankly, more fun. Below, we've gathered the best Pilates equipment worth having for home workouts, whether you're a beginner or deep in your Pilates princess era. For more wellness recommendations, check out our other guides, including the Best Protein Powders, Best Massage Guns, and Yoga Mats, Props, and Everything Else You Need for Your Practice.\n\nPilates Clothes\n\nNothing motivates me to work out quite like a great Pilates outfit. You can technically wear just about anything, but I would stick to more fitted activewear, so your Pilates instructor can check your form. Avoid loose or oversized clothing, and prioritize stretchy fabrics that won't restrict movement. This lineup of athleisure has been tried and tested in Pilates; they move well, feel comfortable, and hold up every session.\n\nGrip Socks\n\nIf you buy one thing, make it grippy socks. Whether you're on a mat or a reformer machine, those rubberized soles help prevent slipping and sliding, giving you better traction and stability during movements. A good pair can also offer light cushioning and arch support. If you're practicing in a shared studio or using communal equipment, breathable Pilates socks are a hygienic upgrade, too.\n\nCourtesy of Amazon Flydo Pilates Grippy Socks $15 $13 (13% off) Amazon (2-Pack) WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Sold in a variety of colorways and combinations TIRED Silica gel grip starts to degrade with regular machine-washing and wear Courtesy of Souls Souls I'm Literally Just a Girl Grip Socks $20 Souls WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Breathable fabric with fun designs TIRED More expensive than its competitors\n\nLeggings and Bottoms\n\nWe want our bottoms to stay put through roll-ups, leg circles, and long pulses, without digging or losing shape. They also need to be squat-proof. High-waisted leggings (full-length or capri) made from a soft, stretchy fabric are ideal for Pilates and other low-impact workouts. Biker shorts also work, but in a heated class, an extra layer of fabric can help maintain grip on props during leg work.\n\nThese are the best leggings for Pilates based on our testing, including a Lululemon biker short we love.

I gravitate toward wide bands with no underwires that won't dig in during floor work, but I'm also aware that those features might not be supportive for bigger busts.

The proper ones are designed with a grippy, textured surface for added traction. They keep you steady, supporting better control. And they serve as a protective barrier between your skin and the yucky floor.\n\nI also always need a towel when working out, and if you're taking a heated class, this is especially necessary to absorb sweat. Pro tip: You can also turn your towel into a resistance band by twisting it and pulling against it.

I take heated mat Pilates at my local fitness studio twice a week, and we usually use a combination of props: an exercise ball, Pilates ring (aka. a magic circle), and light weights. I like to use 2- or 3-pound dumbbells, but wrist and ankle weights don't require grip strength and still add extra intensity to your full-body Pilates workout. Core sliders, which go under your hands or feet, add resistance to your movements and are an affordable alternative to the springs of a reformer.\n\nGaiam 8-Inch Inflatable Anti-Burst Exercise Ball $12 $10 (17% off) Amazon WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Strengthens core engagement\n\nImproves balance and stability TIRED Can be frustrating to inflate\n\nAir retention is not the best Courtesy of Amazon Bala Bangles Wrist & Ankle Weights $65 Amazon (2 Pounds) WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Comes in three different weights\n\nCan be worn on the wrist or ankles\n\nLots of colors TIRED Does not improve grip strength\n\nCan cause tendon and joint injuries if not careful\n\nCourtesy of Amazon Azure Life Exercise Core Sliders $10 Amazon WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Improves core engagement and balance\n\nPortable and affordable TIRED Not the best on carpeted floors\n\nFlimsy Courtesy of Amazon Gaiam Pilates Ring $20 $16 (20% off) Amazon WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Decent resistance\n\nStrengthens muscle engagement and stability TIRED Amazon customers have reported poor, long-term durability\n\nFlimsy padding\n\nReusable Water Bottles\n\nWe've spotlighted a few of our favorites below, but you can find more tested picks in our Best Reusable Water Bottles guide.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

The company is now rolling out the requirement globally after first testing it in a few markets last month.\n\nTo complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it will delete any images or videos of users. The verification is being processed by a third-party vendor, Persona, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.\n\nThe company says users who are 13 and older can also choose to verify their age through ID verification instead of facial verification. Roblox notes that while age checks are optional, they’re required if users want to access communication features. In other words, you don’t have to verify your age to use Roblox, but you do need verification to use chat features.\n\nIf the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.\n\nImage Credits:Roblox\n\n“Leveraging multiple signals, Roblox is constantly evaluating user behavior to determine if someone is significantly older or younger than expected,” the company wrote in a blog post. “In these situations, Roblox will soon ask users to repeat the age-check process.”\n\nOnce users complete an age check, they can access age-based chat, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with users in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.\n\nRoblox says chat is disabled by default for children under 9 unless a parent provides consent following an age check.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company’s podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.\n\nDoubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.\n\nThe new moves come as Spotify’s been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched.\n\nBut that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

We’ve rounded up the biggest CES 2026 curveballs so far.\n\nThe Razr Fold Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nMotorola has really gotten into a groove with its clamshell-style flip phones over the past few years. They’re a natural fit with the Razr legacy, and Moto has done some really fun stuff with them. Years went by and it seemed like the company was content to focus on flip phones, but that hasn’t turned out to be the case. Almost as surprising: the book-style fold carries Razr branding, too. I guess Motorola is ready to move beyond the nostalgia factor with its brand and embrace the future. — Allison Johnson\n\nDespite Asus, Broadcom, and MediaTek announcing Wi-Fi 8 routers and chipsets at CES 2026, the IEEE 802.11bn successor to Wi-Fi 7 isn’t fully ratified and won’t be until late 2028. Nevertheless, they plan to start selling hardware built on the draft spec later this year. It’ll be truly bleeding-edge stuff, likely requiring a firmware upgrade to be compliant with the final 2028 standard. Hopefully, it won’t be a repeat of the “Draft-N” fiasco suffered from 2007–2009, when the draft 802.11n Wi-Fi spec changed significantly over that same two-year timeframe, leaving some devices orphaned. — Thomas Ricker\n\nThis is the first robot vacuum that can both climb and clean your stairs. Andru Marino / The Verge\n\nRobot vacuums with arms? You don’t even need to remind me that those came out in 2025. It’s now 2026, and we live in the future, one where robot vacuums have legs. Roborock’s new Saros Rover prototype swapped appendages, trading the ability to pick up socks for some very compelling locomotion. It can climb stairs! This alleviates my biggest concern about setting my little robot vacuum free near my cat-hair-coated stairs: that it’ll fall to its death (which, ironically, I’ll have to clean up with a different vacuum). Like my colleague Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, I also look forward to whenever Roborock can put both arms and legs on a robot vacuum. — Cameron Faulkner\n\nAt $9,999.99 for the 98-inch, TCL’s TV offerings aren’t exactly affordable. Image: TCL\n\nCES is always a showcase for huge TVs, but it’s also been a way to see the more reasonable TVs we should expect in the following year. In 2025, TCL came out of the gate with the QM6K — its most affordable of the QM line — and teased the QM7K, LG showed off the G5 with a brand new OLED panel technology (even if we needed Panasonic to confirm what it was), and both Samsung and Hisense showed off a range of reasonably sized TVs. There was a lot for regular consumers to look forward to. But this year has been almost exclusively about big and expensive TVs. Sure, Amazon is showing off their affordable Ember Artline, LG has the C6 and G6 on the floor, and a bunch of people will buy the Wallpaper TV. But companies aren’t focusing on sets people can actually afford. We have no information from Hisense, TCL put the QM8L on the floor with zero information, Sony TVs are (per usual) absent from CES, and Samsung focused on a bigger RGB LED instead of the smaller sizes. It’s fun to be aspirational, but it’s also good to know your options for a new, more sensible TV. — John Higgins\n\nSamsung’s new foldable OLED panel IImage: Samsung Display\n\nI expected this to come at some point, but not at CES this year. Samsung had a demo of a creaseless folding display, which means we might be getting even closer to foldable phones that mainstream consumers will actually buy. Why this matters: Samsung provides displays for Apple, and Bloomberg reported in November that Apple’s folding iPhone is set to launch sometime in the fall. Samsung, which pulled the demo from its CES booth, told The Verge that the screen at CES was an R&D concept with no current timeline or plan for commercialization. Still, my guess is Apple won’t launch a folding phone until the crease is invisible. So, this may have been our first look at that screen. — Todd Haselton\n\nCES used to be one of the world’s biggest car shows. But this year, the cars have been replaced by AI chatbots and humanoid robots. Hyundai, one of the biggest EV sellers, brought out a production version of Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot. BMW announced it was integrating Alexa Plus. Mercedes revealed its new Nvidia-powered driver-assist. The only concept car to grace the stage was Sony and Honda’s Afeela SUV — and this was from a company that hasn’t even sold any cars yet. CES used to be a showcase for weird movable machines, but there was a noticeable absence this year. Blame the EV doldrums or trade anxiety or whatever.

Discovery (WBD) and its extensive library of hit TV shows and films like “Harry Potter,” “Game of Thrones” and the DC Comics titles, is dragging on.\n\nThe studio on Wednesday said its board had unanimously rejected Paramount Skydance’s revised $108.4 billion bid, calling the proposal a “leveraged buyout” that would saddle the company with $87 billion in debt.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, WBD urged them to reject the offer, saying the “extraordinary amount” of debt Paramount would need to raise heightens the risk of the deal falling through, and instead recommended they vote in favor of its earlier, $82.7 billion deal with Netflix for its film and TV studio asserts.\n\nParamount, which was rumored to be in the running to buy WBD before the Netflix deal was announced, went directly to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash, $30-per-share offer in early December after Warner Bros’ board decided to sell to Netflix. But WBD rejected Paramount’s bid, calling the offer “illusory” and saying Paramount did not have the cash to back up its claims, and instead recommended Netflix’s cash-and-share deal.\n\nParamount then came back with a $40 billion guarantee from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and said it would raise $54 billion in debt to fund the deal.\n\nWBD doesn’t seem convinced. “[Paramount] is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization […] This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger,” WBD wrote in a statement.\n\nWarner Bros. also called into question Paramount’s ability to function well if the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

It makes excellent, subtle, hot drip coffee. But it also does something that almost no other fancy coffee maker on the market achieves. It makes real cold brew coffee—the sweet and gentle stuff, the cool elixir of smooth summers and milky heaven.\n\nThe Luxe is part of a new generation of drip coffee makers that has helped transform drip coffee from bitter office fuel into a subject for connoisseurship. The Luxe's predecessor, the Precision Brewer, was one of only a handful certified by the Specialty Coffee Association to brew drip coffee according to narrow benchmarks on temperature and extraction. The Luxe, though not yet certified, brews according to these same exacting criteria.\n\nThe Luxe achieves this feat through a whole lot of technical sophistication. This means PID temperature controllers, tightly controlled flow rates, programmable algorithms for different water volumes, and the same thermocoil heating technology and pump you’d use to make espresso.\n\nBut the Luxe makes cold brew, blessedly, by leaving it alone. Real cold brew is made only with coffee, water, and time. Messing with this formula, or hurrying it up, never quite gives you the real thing. The Luxe gives you the real thing—holding room-temp water and coffee grounds in suspension for as long as 24 hours before releasing it into a waiting carafe. In a world of coffee makers desperate to screw up cold brew, leaving it alone amounts to wild innovation. I haven’t seen this function in any coffee maker not made by Breville.\n\nThe device isn’t perfect, of course. There are some quirks. But the Luxe is an impressive machine that keeps Breville in the conversation when it comes to the best drip coffee devices out there.\n\nThe Fast Drip\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nBefore we return to cold brew, let’s talk drip coffee.

Unlike CES 2025 where several companies embraced built-in charging cables, there’s no unifying theme to the hardware revealed at CES 2026. But the new chargers and power banks are getting more powerful, more portable, more functional, and more stylish… even though all some of us want is a return to basic and inexpensive.\n\nHere are our picks for the standout chargers and power banks making their debut at CES this year.\n\nImage: Anker\n\nDoes every charger need a screen? Probably not, but Anker is justifying the addition of a display to its new $39.99 45W Nano Charger with some unique functionality. The charger identifies recent iPhone and iPad models and displays additional information as they charge including their current battery level and temperature, alongside cute animations. There’s just a single USB-C port, but the Nano Charger’s folding prongs now rotate 180 degrees to make the port always accessible.\n\nImage: Belkin\n\nThe problem with nearly all 3-in-1 wireless charging stands is that they only support the Apple Watch. Belkin’s new UltraCharge Modular Charging Dock is designed to accommodate other wearables, too, including Samsung’s smartwatches and the first- and second-gen Google Pixel watches. You just need to supply your own charging puck and install it in a pop-out support on the back of the stand using a collection of included spacers to ensure it securely fits. It’s expected to launch in Q1 2026 for $64.99 and includes an adjustable 25W Qi2.2 wireless charging pad for smartphones and a smaller pad for wireless earbuds.\n\nImage: Baseus\n\nIf it’s actually as small as the promotional images make it seem, Baseus’ new PicoGo power bank could become this year’s must-have travel accessory. It features a 10,000mAh battery squeezed into an accessory that looks nearly as small as your wireless earbuds’ charging case. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed, but the PicoGo comes with a 45W USB-C port so you can even charge some laptops and a built-in USB-C cable for charging a pair of devices simultaneously.\n\nImage: Clicks\n\nIf you like the idea behind Clicks’ keyboard cases but don’t want a BlackBerry-style keypad always hanging off the bottom of your phone (or don’t use one of the limited number of smartphones it supports) its new magnetic wireless power bank is a clever alternative. On the back of the 2150mAh battery is a slide-out compact keyboard that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth. You can extend it only when needed, and because it uses magnets, it can attach to any smartphone that’s compatible with the Qi standard. The Clicks Power Keyboard is expected to be available in the Spring for $109, but discounted preorders are now available for $79.\n\nA photo of a charging tray, with several devices in it, on a table. Image: Twelve South\n\nWhat if your wireless charger didn’t look like one? That’s the question Twelve South has tried to answer with its new $179.99 Valet. It’s essentially a stylish leather-covered tray with a metal frame and both can be customized to match your aesthetic or decor. You can drop your keys, wallet, and pocket change on one side when you get home, while the other side has a raised 15W Qi charging pad to top off your phone. There’s also an additional 15W USB port on the side for charging another device, and Twelve South includes a 36W power supply.\n\nImage: Anker\n\nInstead of putting a towering hub or docking station on your desk to expand your accessible power ports, Anker’s $69.99 Nano Power Strip is designed to clamp to the edge and keep part of it hidden beneath. It makes two AC jacks, two USB-A, and two 70W USB-C ports accessible from on top of your desk, plus four additional AC outlets on the underside.\n\nPhoto: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nWith Loona’s DeskMate charging hub, your smartphone doesn’t become an inanimate glass slab while it recharges. Launching through a crowdfunding campaign in March for “below $300,” the hub pairs three USB-C ports and a USB-A port with a Qi2 wireless charging pad. It should charge any Qi2-compatible smartphone, but the DeskMate is specifically designed for the iPhone, automatically activating a cute AI companion when your phone is docked. A pair of expressive eyes will follow you around the room as the stand rotates and tilts, but the DeskMate isn’t just about having an AI-powered desk companion, it also has practical features including Slack integration.\n\nImage: Belkin\n\nBelkin’s UltraCharge Pro Power Bank 10K with Magnetic Ring is a run-of-the-mill portable charger with a built-in display, 25W Qi2.2 wireless charging support, and up to 30W of power delivery through its USB-C port. What might make the $99.99 a tempting alternative to other power banks when it launches in Q1 2026 is that it won’t replace a PopSocket or other magnetic accessory while you use it. Belkin put an extra ring of magnets on the back so you can keep using a MagSafe wallet or a pop-up grip while your phone charges.\n\nImage: Baseus\n\nWhen you demand more than just power from your charger, Baseus’ new Spacemate RD1 Pro could fit the bill when it launches in April for $259.99. On top you’ll find a tilting Qi2.2 25W charging pad so you can adjust the angle of your smartphone while it charges, while down below is a plethora of ports. There are two HDMI ports so you can use the RD1 Pro as a hub to connect a laptop to a pair of 4K displays, plus four USB-C ports, four USB-A ports, 1Gbps ethernet, and memory card slots. Its total power output maxes out at 160W so you can easily charge multiple devices simultaneously, including a laptop.\n\nImage: Belkin\n\nBelkin’s original Charging Case for Nintendo Switch 2 is barely seven months old after debuting alongside the console last June, but the company has already announced an improved Pro version with a handful of welcome upgrades. For starters, you no longer need to open the case to charge its internal 10,000mAh battery. There’s now an external USB-C port for connecting power, next to a small display showing the battery’s remaining charge level. The battery itself has also been redesigned and now has an integrated adjustable stand that connects the Switch 2 to a USB-C port, similar to the console’s own charging dock.

Kennedy Jr. was still a presidential candidate, he posted a video on X in which he admitted to dumping a dead bear cub near an old bicycle in Central Park 10 years prior, in a mystifying attempt to make the young bear’s premature death look like a cyclist’s hit and run.\n\nAt the time, Kennedy said he was trying to get ahead of a story The New Yorker was about to publish that mentioned the incident. But in coming clean, Kennedy solved a decade-old New York City mystery: How and why had a young black bear—a wild animal native to the state, but not to modern-era Manhattan—been found dead under a bush near West 69th Street in Central Park?\n\nWIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from public records requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.\n\nWIRED has obtained documents that shed new light on the incident from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation via a public records request. The documents—which include previously unseen photos of the bear cub—resurface questions about the bizarre choices Kennedy says he made, which left city employees dealing with the aftermath and lamenting the cub’s short life and grim fate.\n\nA representative for Kennedy did not respond for comment. The New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Parks Department referred WIRED to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. NYDEC spokesperson Jeff Wernick tells WIRED that its investigation into the death of the bear cub was closed in late 2014 “due to a lack of sufficient evidence” to determine whether state law had been violated. They added that New York’s environmental conservation law forbids “illegal possession of a bear without a tag or permit and illegal disposal of a bear” and that “the statute of limitations for these offenses is one year.”\n\nThe first of a number of emails between local officials coordinating the handling of the baby bear’s remains was sent at 10:16 am on October 6, 2014. Bonnie McGuire, then-deputy director at Urban Park Rangers, told two colleagues that UPR sergeant Eric Handy had recently called her about a “dead black bear” found in Central Park.\n\n“NYPD told him they will treat it like a crime scene, so he can’t get too close,” McGuire wrote. “I’ve asked him to take pictures and send them over and to keep us posted.”\n\n“Poor little guy!” McGuire wrote in a separate email later that morning.\n\nAccording to emails obtained by WIRED, Handy updated several colleagues throughout the day, noting that the Department of Environmental Conservation had arrived on scene and that the agency was planning to coordinate with the NYPD to transfer the body to the Bronx Zoo, where it would be inspected by the NYPD’s animal cruelty unit and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. (This didn’t end up happening, as NYDEC took the bear to a state lab near Albany.)\n\nImagery of the bear has been public before—local news footage from October 2014 appears to show it from a distance. However, the documents WIRED obtained show previously unpublished images that investigators took of the bear on the scene, which Handy sent as attachments in emails to McGuire. The bear is seen laying on its side in an unnatural position. Its head protrudes from under a bush and rests next to a small patch of grass.

{"title": "The Ancient Art of Nasal Rinsing Might Protect You From a Cold", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/cold-nose-washing-nasal-saline-rinse/", "summary": "New research has given credence to a 5,000-year-old practice.", "content": "On average, the typical American contracts two to three colds per year between September and May, at an estimated cost of around $40 billion to the economy. Effective forms of treating or preventing colds have proven hard to come by, with the majority of over-the-counter medicines yielding modest results; it’s hard to devise a drug that tackles the vast array of viral pathogens that cause them. The need for better respiratory protection during the winter months is clear. It might be found in a practice that dates back thousands of years.\n\nThe concept of saline nasal irrigation, or bathing the nasal passages with a saltwater solution, is thought to have been introduced as part of Ayurveda, an alternative medicine system that originated in the Indian subcontinent more than 5,000 years ago. Now, modern science is beginning to demonstrate that this ancient practice really does serve as a surprisingly effective shield against many of the seasonal bugs behind the common cold.\n\nIn 2024, a major new study of nearly 14,000 people funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research in the UK found that using a simple saline-based nasal spray between three and six times a day at the first sign of an infection reduced illness duration by around 20 percent. A follow-up study, published last year, reported similar benefits.\n\nAccording to Paul Little, a professor in primary care research at the University of Southampton who led both studies, sodium chloride—the chemical name for salt—is capable of stimulating a natural antiviral mechanism within the nose. “The chloride in saline is taken up by the cells of the nose and throat, and converted into hypochlorous acid within these cells which inhibits viral replication,” says Little. “In doing so, the viral load in the nose is reduced.”\n\nArchived medical journals reveal that this practice has been examined as part of Western medicine since the 19th century, but has often been treated with a degree of skepticism. During the early stages of the Covid pandemic, many health care professionals dismissed the suggestion that saline nasal irrigation might be able to prevent infections. The technique was initially listed among other debunked therapies on the World Health Organization’s Covid myth buster page, before being later removed as a steady trickle of research began to prove that regular use of saline sprays or irrigation really could limit the effects.\n\nOne study found that people who practiced saline nasal irrigation for two weeks after testing positive for Covid were more than eight times less likely to be hospitalized, leading to a resurgence of interest among doctors regarding its ability to dampen the effects of other seasonal infections.\n\n“Clinicians and researchers have started paying increasing attention to saline nasal irrigation because it helps, and it is natural, easy to understand care,” says David Rábago, a physician and professor at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. “So far the results of many small studies and a few big ones are that saline nasal irrigation is safe and effective.”\n\nAs well as blocking viral replication within nasal cells, it appears that saline can increase the activity of a group of white blood cells called neutrophils—which help to fight off pathogens—while also enhancing the ability of mucus to encircle and trap viruses.\n\n“When perfectly hydrated, the mucus cells make a barrier and envelop a virus, so that you can either swallow it where the [stomach] acid degrades it, or cough it up,” says Amy Baxter, a pediatrician and assistant clinical professor in medicine at Augusta University. “It’s kind of like how soap works; it surrounds the dirt and makes it easier for it to come off because it fully envelopes these little particles.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:18:46 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T16:44:21.442304"}
{"title": "Venezuela Is the First Big Test for the Pentagon's Influencer Press Corps—and It's Failing", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/venezuela-pentagon-press-corps/", "summary": "Mainstream reporters are out at the Pentagon, and right-wing influencers are in. The results are predictable, and oddly reminiscent of Iraq War-era warblogging.", "content": "In the days following the kidnapping of Venezuela president Nicolás Maduro, members of the Pentagon’s new right-wing influencer press corps weren’t reporting on the operation. Instead, they were enforcing loyalty in a manner similar to the Iraq war bloggers of the early 2000s.\n\nOn Monday, Laura Loomer tried to crowdsource information on Pentagon press officials who may have leaked information to the mainstream media. “The White House account better be cooking up a sick edit,” Cam Higby, a right-wing influencer and member of the Pentagon press corps, wrote on X Saturday morning, as news of Maduro’s arrest broke. Monica Paige, a reporter for Turning Point USA, opted to slam the former Biden administration, reposting a 2020 post from Joe Biden about Trump admiring dictators with the now infamous image of a blindfolded Maduro. Joey Mannarino, an influencer with more than 650,000 followers on X, spent Sunday debating whether to support vice president JD Vance or Marco Rubio as president for 2028.\n\nThese influencers were all granted Pentagon press credentials in November after the Pentagon rolled out a new press policy forbidding journalists from accessing information the Defense Department—which the administration styles as the War Department—does not make readily available to them. Most mainstream outlets—including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox News—refused to sign on to it, forcing an exodus of military beat reporters from the ranks of the Pentagon’s official press corps. Weeks later, the Pentagon replaced them with Trump-friendly influencers from organizations like Turning Point USA, as well as independent creators like Tim Pool, a right-wing political commentator.\n\nThe new press corp has only received one official briefing from Defense Department press secretary Kingsley Wilson, who leveraged the moment to attack the old-guard journalists who had left. Before joining the Pentagon, Wilson ran digital media for the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank.\n\n“Legacy media chose to self-deport from this building,” Wilson said. “We’re not going to beg these old gatekeepers to come back, and we’re not rebuilding a broken model to appease them. Instead, we’re welcoming new media outlets that actually reach Americans.”\n\nThis model has clearly not been about journalism, or access to information. So far, the Pentagon’s crew of right-wing influencers haven’t reported any new information related to the Venezuela raid. Several of them, including Higby, have turned their attention to alleged childcare fraud in Minnesota, chasing the same story that right-wing creator Nick Shirley claimed to uncover in a viral YouTube video last week. (Local Minnesota outlets have been covering this story for years.)\n\nThis moment feels reminiscent of the early days of the Iraq war, where pro-war bloggers promised a similarly unrestrained alternative to mainstream coverage. These bloggers built entire audiences attacking writers in the mainstream press and other independent blogs who criticized the war, pushing narratives that supported the US’s invasion of Iraq. In the days since Maduro’s capture, creators like Lancevideos, who is part of the Pentagon’s official press corps, have called congressional critics like Thomas Massie “libtards” for criticizing the operation.

It’s a product that will make large installations simpler and cheaper while minimizing the footprint outside the home, and it’s key to the startup’s plans for expansion, which were recently turbocharged by a $20 million Series B focused on expanding sales.\n\nBut the real story is how Quilt developed the new product.\n\nSince its founding, Quilt has prided itself on the amount of data it collects from its heat pumps. Not only are they internet-connected, they’re also laced with more sensors than typical heat pumps.\n\nBy analyzing that data, Quilt engineers have been able to do things that other companies have not. In September, for example, they shipped an over-the-air update to heat pumps in people’s homes that unlocked an additional 20% capacity, which could be directed toward either one or two zones. With the free update, people could be more comfortable during heat waves and cold snaps.\n\nThe team also used the data to develop the new three-zone unit and, in the process, solve a vexing challenge that many competitors face.\n\nLike all heat pumps, multi-zone units work best when they’re run at variable speed — that is, when heating or cooling demand is low, the compressor runs at a lower speed to deliver only the amount of heating or cooling that’s needed.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Compressors become less stable at low speeds, making them harder to control. Matthew Knoll, co-founder and CTO at Quilt, compares it to driving a car a low speeds. Maintaining an even 70 mph is easier than a steady 11 mph. “It’s a little harder,” he said.\n\nTo compensate, most systems stop the compressor at a certain point, sacrificing some efficiency and comfort in the process.\n\nQuilt, though, was able to draw on data collected from the thousand or so units already installed in people’s homes and businesses, giving them insights into how the systems were operating in the real world.\n\n“The way most systems are developed, they’re tested in a lab under a couple scenarios because testing’s expensive. And you end up with kind of a you know an average product,” Knoll said.\n\n“We have a thousand units out there in many different climates, and if we see something, we can look at it across a bunch of different units to understand if there’s room to optimize or if we’re seeing a problem in a corner case,” he said\n\nThe company also uses a larger copper coil than many competitors, which allows it to spec a smaller compressor. That combination, along with some other tweaks to the design, allows Quilt to deliver nearly 90% of its rated capacity (27,000 BTUs) at -13˚ F (-25˚ C) without sacrificing low-demand performance or efficiency. Quilt says it’s the most efficient three-zone mini-split on the market.\n\nTo save power, each indoor head can be controlled individually, supplying as little as 2,210 BTUs of heat or 1,570 BTUs of cooling. If heating or cooling isn’t needed, refrigerant still flows through the lines like it does in other heat pumps. But thanks to the outdoor unit’s low-speed performance, it only releases around 300 BTUs of heat in heating mode. That’s about as much heat as a grown adult throws off.\n\nWhere does Quilt go from here? Knoll wouldn’t comment on future plans other than to say that Quilt “wants to be able to have a solution for all homes.” More products are coming, and it’s likely that reams of data will help lead their development.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T16:44:21.857393"}

According to Deloitte’s 2026 Global Automotive Consumer Study, 7 percent of US car buyers want an electric vehicle for their next car. While that might sound rather meager, it’s a 40 percent increase from 2025’s survey, which found just 5 percent of car buyers wanted an EV.\n\nPlain old internal combustion remains Americans’ first choice, with 61 percent telling the survey that’s how their next ride will be powered. Twenty-one percent want a hybrid, up from 20 percent last year. Just 5 percent indicated a desire for a plug-in hybrid (down from 6 percent last year), with the remaining confused souls either unsure of what to buy next (4 percent) or some other option, presumably hydrogen (1 percent).\n\nA graph showing preference for engine type in car buyers’ next vehicle. Credit: Deloitte\n\nThe high demand for internal combustion engines makes the US an outlier among large car-buying markets. Fewer than half of German car buyers want another gas-powered vehicle, and that number falls to just 41 percent in China, Japan, and South Korea. But those consumers aren’t all fleeing internal combustion for battery EVs. Well, they mostly are in China, where EV demand is now 20 percent. But in Japan, only 5 percent of consumers want a battery EV, versus 37 percent indicating their next car would be a hybrid.\n\nDeloitte conducted the survey between October and November 2025, by which time the current US government’s anti-EV policies would have come into effect. These include cancelling the clean vehicle tax credit, rolling back fuel efficiency standards, and declining to prosecute automakers that exceed existing efficiency regulations, as well as the uncertainty of capricious import tariffs. Many automakers have spent the last several years building up capacity to manufacture EVs in North America for the US market, but the return on those investments is unlikely be soon.\n\nAmericans also lag behind many of their international peers when it comes to that most important condition for buying an EV or plug-in hybrid: having somewhere to plug it in at night. Fifty-three percent of US respondents said they do not have a way to charge at home. By contrast, that number was 20 percent in Germany and just six percent in China.

That’s mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market.\n\nBut a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur’s complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials.\n\nSulfur chemistry\n\nSulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that’s not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin materials that have been studied. But it’s also willing to give electrons up, forming chemical compounds with things like chlorine and oxygen.\n\nIt’s that last feature the researchers behind the new paper are most interested in. Pure sulfur forms an eight-atom complex that can give up 32 total electrons under the right conditions. The trick was finding the right conditions.\n\nThe system had a cathode of pure sulfur and an anode that was simply a strip of aluminum that acted as a current collector. The electrolytes the researchers tested contained a lot of aluminum, sodium, and chlorine (typically something like eight Molar aluminum chloride and a 4.5 Molar solution of some sodium salt). The aluminum helps stabilize the foil at the anode, while the other two chemicals participate in the reactions that power the battery.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:02:21 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T16:44:22.748031"}

They reveal a little more about a murky but important moment in our evolutionary history.\n\nFrom predators’ quarry to rock quarry\n\nArchaeologists unearthed the 773,000-year-old bones just southwest of Casablanca in a cave aptly named Grotte à Hominidés. They’re just fragments of what used to be hominins: an adult’s lower jawbone, plus the partial lower jaw from another adult and a very young child, along with a handful of teeth and vertebrae. A hominin femur from the same layer of sediment in the cave has clear gnaw marks from sharp carnivore teeth, offering a chilling clue about how the bones got there.\n\nThe layer of sediment in which the fossils lay spanned a few thousand years on either side of a long-ago flip in the polarity of Earth’s magnetic field (periodically our planet just… does that), which happened around 773,000 years ago.

There’s compelling science behind using red and infrared light therapy to address skin concerns, particularly wrinkles. However, wellness influencers have taken that concept and absolutely ran away with it.\n\nWhile it’s a legitimate treatment you can get from a dermatologist, you’ll also see at-home masks touted on TikTok, in wellness spas, and even gyms as a cure-all for this and that ailment. Every year at CES, I see plenty of companies jumping in on the trend with their own versions. Some flash nine different colors, some falsely advertise “FDA approval.” It’s such a crapshoot that for most people, I generally don’t recommend purchasing the device.\n\nSo I was pleasantly surprised when I got to see L’Oréal’s LED Face Mask at CES this year.\n\nThe number one rule of wearable tech is simple: it must be wearable. You can have all the science in the world, but your wearable gadget ain’t worth shit if it’s not comfortable to wear. The vast majority of LED face masks on the market are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and make you look like a Temu version of Jason Voorhees. Admittedly, L’Oréal’s mask does look uncanny in these pictures, but there’s a crucial difference. They take their inspiration from sheet masks. There are two iterations: one for your entire face, and smaller masks that build off the reusable silicone eye masks that’ve boomed in popularity over the past few years.\n\nThe mask is conceptually like combining a sheet mask with red light and near-infrared light therapy.\n\nThis is savvy. Sheet masks are a beauty treatment that is not only widely available, but they’re also often an existing part of skin care nerds’ routines. In essence, L’Oréal isn’t introducing a whole new step — it’s potentially condensing them.\n\nI didn’t get to wear the prototype masks myself for hygienic reasons. That said, I did get to handle them and view them on Guive Balooch, L’Oréal’s global vice president of tech and open innovation. They’re made of lightweight, thin, and flexible material. And, unlike the hard, rigid masks flooding the market, this mask sits directly on top of your skin, which helps penetration. A user only has to wear it for five to ten minutes. Five, if they want to address fine lines. Ten if they want to target deeper wrinkles. Existing LED masks generally require users to wear them for ten to 20 minutes. Plus, another benefit of a flexible material means that it could one day also be applied to other areas that are challenging to treat, like the neck and decolletage.\n\nI wasn’t able to wear the mask myself for sanitary reasons, but here’s L’Oréal’s Guive Balooch modeling it for us.\n\nAnother gripe I have with LED light masks is that red and infrared light therapy only works at certain wavelengths. A ton of available LED masks don’t tell you that information — and for the ones boasting eight or nine different colors, there’s not a ton of evidence proving efficacy.\n\nBalooch tells me that to make its mask, L’Oréal partnered with a startup called iSmart, which is also behind the tech in another popular mask by Omnilux.\n\n“They have lots of clinicals, and working with them we found a way to bring a flexible electronic that has the same power with two wavelengths: 630nm and 830nm,” Balooch says, noting that iSmart has an extensive 20 years of conducting peer-reviewed research in this area. “We wanted to work with a clinically driven science team, and there are not very many out there.”\n\nBalooch is also frank when I ask whether the mask’s design could potentially help make existing skincare routines more effective using existing products like serums and moisturizers.\n\n“Not all formulas are activated by certain wavelengths of light. To activate something, you need to design the molecule and that’s what we’re doing with our labs — figuring out what molecules are activated by the wavelengths we have so we can design a particular formula for it. So could it synergize? Yes if you can create the right product. Will it reduce any effectiveness? No,” says Balooch. He noted it was possible that the fact that the mask sits on the skin itself could help with absorption as well, but that would have to be studied further to know for sure.\n\nA smaller eye mask version. Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\n\nAnother thing I appreciate is that L’Oréal is making the effort to get 510(k) FDA clearance for the mask. Obtaining this kind of FDA clearance doesn’t necessarily mean the mask is more effective, but it does assert the product is safe to use and isn’t making false marketing claims. It can be a lengthy and expensive process, which in this space, generally means a company is willing to go through extra hoops instead of defaulting to “wellness.”\n\nI’m not about to straight up say that “This is the LED mask you should buy.” That sort of endorsement requires testing and research. Plus, we don’t yet know how this will be priced. On top of that, this device isn’t slated to hit shelves until 2027, pending FDA clearance. However, if I were in the market for such a device, these are the criteria I’d want to see from an LED mask maker when making an educated choice.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T12:01:57-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T17:13:57.505546"}

It’s not cheap for its size, costing $159, but you might value its quick repositioning and plug-and-play features to be worth the cost.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n1 / 2 Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nXreal launched the 1S smart glasses at CES 2026, along with its $99 Neo power bank that doubles as a dock for the Switch 2 and other video sources. The most notable aspect of the 1S is that the price is $50 cheaper than the previous iteration (it costs $449), yet it still has a solid field-of-view, 120Hz refresh rate support, and a comfortable fit. The Neo might be worth it to you if you’ve been dying to play Switch 2 through your glasses. It’s one of the slickest power banks I’ve used, and its MagSafe magnet makes it easy to mount your iPhone to when you want to get lost in a movie.\n\nImage: Audeze\n\nAudeze unveiled its Maxwell 2 wireless gaming headset at CES in two configurations, one for $329 that works with all gaming platforms except Xbox, and one for $349 that works with Xbox, too. One of the big updates in the newer model is the addition of magnetic ear pads, which can be easily removed and replaced, if need be. The headphones include a removable boom microphone, and features wireless support via Bluetooth 5.3 or 2.4GHz with its included USB-C dongle.\n\nImage: LG\n\nLG debuted its brightest, fastest OLED monitor at CES, and it might be exactly what you’ve been waiting for. The 27-inch 27GX790B-B tops out at 540Hz refresh rate while in 1440p (quite impressive), or you can go even faster with a 720Hz refresh rate, although the resolution drops all the way down to 720p. This is the first LG UltraGear monitor to feature LG Display’s Primary RGB Tandem and its fourth-gen WOLED screen tech that lets it get up to 335 nits at typical brightness. It’s $999 through LG.\n\nThe 75-percent Q1 Ultra in black. Image: Keychron\n\nKeychron launched the Q Ultra and V Ultra keyboard at CES. They mark the company’s foray into making ZMK mechanical keyboards, which is an open-source firmware that’s more battery efficient than QMK. In other works, they’re made for people who want to flash custom firmware onto their boards. The series starts at $229.99 for the 75-percent Q1 Ultra, $229.99 for the tenkeyless Q3 Ultra, and just $10 more for the full-size Q6 Ultra.

At CES this week, Lenovo announced it will launch a version of last year’s high-priced, high-powered Legion Go 2 handheld with Valve’s gaming-focused, Linux-based OS pre-installed starting in June. And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well.\n\nA new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn’t exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S almost exactly a year ago. When that version hit the market last spring, Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware on many popular games.\n\nValve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS’s footprint beyond its own hardware. After rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label last May, SteamOS version 3.7 offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the original Legion Go.\n\nAdding the upgraded Legion Go 2 to that list will give those preferring SteamOS an option to buy in to beefier, pre-built handheld hardware without crafting their own Steam Machine from component parts. Like its Windows-based cousin, the new Legion Go 2 will come equipped with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor (like the ROG Ally X), 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and an 8.8-inch 1920×1200 OLED screen. It has a hefty starting price of $1,199.\n\nThe right to bear Arms\n\nEven as SteamOS slowly spreads across the AMD-powered hardware landscape, the OS continues to be limited by a lack of compatibility with the wide world of Arm devices. That could change in the near future, though, as Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset will sport a new version of SteamOS designed specifically for the headset’s Arm-based hardware.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:31:30 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T17:45:51.748409"}

Japan has been slowly reactivating its extensive nuclear power plant collection after it was shut down following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The latest scandal is especially shocking, given that the Hamaoka plant is located on the coast near an active subduction fault—just as Fukushima Daiichi is.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority was reportedly alerted by a whistleblower in February of last year, but the issue became public this week when the regulators halted an evaluation process that could have led to a reactor restart at Hamaoka. This prompted the company that operates the plants, the Chubu Electric Power Co., to issue a press release describing in detail how the company manipulated the seismic safety data.\n\nBased on an English translation, it appears that seismic risks were evaluated at least in part by scaling up the ground motion using data from smaller earthquakes. This is an inexact process, so the standard approach is to create a group of 20 different upscaled earthquake motions and find the one that best represents the average among the 20.\n\nThe company now acknowledges that since 2018, its staff has been generating large collections of upscaled earthquake scenarios, choosing one from among them, and then selecting another 19 so the average would make that event appear representative. The company does not mention how this process affected risk analysis, but it’s probably safe to assume that it was chosen specifically to make any risks seem more tolerable.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:17:02 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T17:45:52.174148"}

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nOpenAI has been dropping hints this week about AI’s role as a “healthcare ally” — and today, the company is announcing a product to go along with that idea: ChatGPT Health.\n\nChatGPT Health is a sandboxed tab within ChatGPT that’s designed for users to ask their health-related questions in a more secure and personalized environment, with a separate chat history and memory feature than the rest of ChatGPT. The company is encouraging users to connect their personal medical records and wellness apps, such as Apple Health, Peloton, MyFitnessPal,Weight Watchers, and Function, “to get more personalized, grounded responses to their questions.” It suggests connecting medical records so that ChatGPT can analyze lab results, visit summaries, and clinical history; MyFitnessPal and Weight Watchers for food guidance; Apple Health for health and fitness data, including movement, sleep, and activity patterns”; and Function for insights into lab tests.\n\n“ChatGPT can help you understand recent test results, prepare for appointments with your doctor, get advice on how to approach your diet and workout routine, or understand the tradeoffs of different insurance options based on your healthcare patterns,” OpenAI writes in the blog post. On the medical records front, OpenAI says it’s partnered with b.well, which will provide back-end integration for users to upload their medical records, since the company works with about 2.2 million providers.\n\nFor now, ChatGPT Health requires users to sign up for a waitlist to request access, as it’s starting with a beta group of early users, but the product will roll out gradually to all users regardless of subscription tier.\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI wrote that based on its “de-identified analysis of conversations,” more than 230 million people around the world already ask ChatGPT questions related to health and wellness each week. OpenAI also said that over the past two years, it’s worked with more than 260 physicians to provide feedback on model outputs more than 600,000 times over 30 areas of focus, to help shape the product’s responses.\n\nThe company makes sure to mention in the blog post that ChatGPT Health is “not intended for diagnosis or treatment,” but it can’t fully control how people end up using AI when they leave the chat. By the company’s own admission, in underserved rural communities, users send nearly 600,000 healthcare-related messages weekly, on average, and seven in 10 healthcare conversations in ChatGPT “happen outside of normal clinic hours.” In August, physicians published a report on a case of a man being hospitalized for weeks with an 18th-century medical condition, after taking ChatGPT’s alleged advice to replace salt in his diet with sodium bromide. Google’s AI Overview made headlines for weeks after its launch over dangerous advice, such as putting glue on pizza, and a recent investigation by The Guardian found that dangerous health advice has continued, with false advice for liver function tests, women’s cancer tests, and recommended diets for those with pancreatic cancer.\n\nOne part of health that OpenAI seemed to carefully avoid mentioning in its blog post: mental health. There are a number of examples of adults or minors dying by suicide after confiding with ChatGPT, and in the blog post, OpenAI stuck to a vague mention that users can customize instructions in the Health product “to avoid mentioning sensitive topics.” When asked during a Wednesday briefing with reporters whether ChatGPT Health would also summarize mental health visits and provide advice in that realm, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said, “Mental health is certainly part of health in general, and we see a lot of people turning to ChatGPT for mental health conversations,” adding that the new product “can handle any part of your health including mental health … We are very focused on making sure that in situations of distress we respond accordingly and we direct toward health professionals,” as well as loved ones or other resources.\n\nIt’s also possible that the product could worsen health anxiety conditions, such as hypochondria. When asked whether OpenAI had introduced any safeguards to help prevent people with such conditions from spiraling while using ChatGPT Health, Simo said, “We have done a lot of work on tuning the model to make sure that we are informative without ever being alarmist and that if there is action to be taken we direct to the healthcare system.”\n\nWhen it comes to security concerns, OpenAI says that ChatGPT Health “operates as a separate space with enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data” and that the company introduced several layers of purpose-built encryption (but not end-to-end encryption), according to the briefing. Conversations within the Health product aren’t used to train its foundation models, by default, and if a user begins a health-related conversation in regular ChatGPT, the chatbot will suggest moving it into the Health product for “additional protections,” per the blog post. But OpenAI has had security breaches in the past, most notably a March 2023 issue that allowed some users to see chat titles, initial messages, names, email addresses, and payment information from other users. In the event of a court order, OpenAI would still need to provide access to the data “where required through valid legal processes or in an emergency situation,” OpenAI head of health Nate Gross said during the briefing.\n\nWhen asked if ChatGPT Health is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gross said that “in the case of consumer products, HIPAA doesn’t apply in this setting — it applies toward clinical or professional healthcare settings.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T14:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T19:03:02.503134"}

They learn either by consuming examples of human work or by trying to solve problems that have been set for them by human instructors.\n\nBut perhaps AI can, in fact, learn in a more human way—by figuring out interesting questions to ask itself and attempting to find the right answer. A project from Tsinghua University, the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), and Pennsylvania State University shows that AI can learn to reason in this way by playing with computer code.\n\nThe researchers devised a system called Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) that first uses a large language model to generate challenging but solvable Python coding problems. It then uses the same model to solve those problems before checking its work by trying to run the code. And finally, the AZR system uses successes and failures as a signal to refine the original model, augmenting its ability to both pose better problems and solve them.\n\nThe team found that their approach significantly improved the coding and reasoning skills of both 7 billion and 14 billion parameter versions of the open source language model Qwen. Impressively, the model even outperformed some models that had received human-curated data.\n\nI spoke to Andrew Zhao, a PhD student at Tsinghua University who came up with the original idea for Absolute Zero, as well as Zilong Zheng, a researcher at BIGAI who worked on the project with him, over Zoom.\n\nZhao told me that the approach resembles the way human learning goes beyond rote memorization or imitation. “In the beginning you imitate your parents and do like your teachers, but then you basically have to ask your own questions,” he said. “And eventually you can surpass those who taught you back in school.”\n\nZhao and Zheng noted that the idea of AI learning in this way, sometimes dubbed “self-play,” dates back years and was previously explored by the likes of Jürgen Schmidhuber, a well-known AI pioneer, and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, a computer scientist at Inria in France.\n\nOne of the most exciting elements of the project, according to Zheng, is the way that the model’s problem-posing and problem-solving skills scale. “The difficulty level grows as the model becomes more powerful,” he says.\n\nA key challenge is that for now the system only works on problems that can easily be checked, like those that involve math or coding. As the project progresses, it might be possible to use it on agentic AI tasks like browsing the web or doing office chores. This might involve having the AI model try to judge whether an agent’s actions are correct.\n\nOne fascinating possibility of an approach like Absolute Zero is that it could, in theory, allow models to go beyond human teaching. “Once we have that it’s kind of a way to reach superintelligence,” Zheng told me.\n\nThere are early signs that the Absolute Zero approach is catching on at some big AI labs.\n\nA project called Agent0, from Salesforce, Stanford, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, involves a software-tool-using agent that improves itself through self-play. As with Absolute Zero, the model gets better at general reasoning through experimental problem-solving. A recent paper written by researchers from Meta, the University of Illinois, and Carnegie Mellon University presents a system that uses a similar kind of self-play for software engineering. The authors of this work suggest that it represents “a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents.”\n\nFinding new ways for AI to learn will likely be a big theme in the tech industry this year. With conventional sources of data becoming scarcer and more expensive, and as labs look for new ways to make models more capable, a project like Absolute Zero might lead to AI systems that are less like copycats and more like humans.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 19:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T19:03:02.809392"}

At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi).\n\nAfter that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.\n\nThe announcement frustrated some of Bose’s long-time customers, some of whom own multiple SoundTouch devices that still function properly. Many questioned companies’ increasingly common practice of bricking expensive products in order to focus on new devices or to minimize costs, or because they’ve gone through acquisitions or bankruptcy. SoundTouch speakers released in 2013 and 2015 with prices ranging from $399 to $1,500.\n\nToday, Bose had better news. In an email to customers, Bose announced that AirPlay and Spotify Connect will still work with SoundTouch speakers after EoL, expanding the wireless capabilities that people will still be able to access.\n\nAdditionally, SoundTouch devices that support AirPlay 2 will be able to play the same audio simultaneously.\n\nThe SoundTouch app will also live on, albeit stripped of some functionality.\n\n“On May 6, 2026, the app will update to a version that supports the functions that can operate locally without the cloud.

Oura’s victory subsequently led to RingConn and Ultrahuman being banned from importing new rings into the US.\n\nThe lawsuit was bad news for both Oura competitors, and especially Ultrahuman, which had planned to expand its US-based manufacturing facility to meet growing market demand (and ostensibly to also get around the new US tariffs). Ultrahuman is distinguished from Oura in that its smart ring does not have a subscription; Oura users pay $6 per month to use its rings.\n\nI caught up briefly with Ultrahuman’s chief business officer, Bhuvan Srinivasan, to clarify the company’s next steps to address the US market, and find out more about the latest smart ring squabbles.\n\nWhy Were the Rings Banned?\n\nAn Ultrahuman smart ring.

Over the past few years, many smart ring manufacturers have been embroiled in legal disputes over this patent.\n\nThis has panned out in a few different ways. In 2024, Oura announced that it had reached a multi-year licensing agreement with Circular, the French smart ring manufacturer, that would allow Circular to continue selling new rings in the US. (This move looks a little less generous when you consider that my two-week testing period of the Circular Ring 2 was plagued with server and connection issues.)\n\nAlso in 2024, Samsung attempted to preemptively sue Oura against future patent infringement claims in a case which a judge dismissed. Samsung’s concerns were not unwarranted. In late 2025, Oura then filed another complaint against Samsung (the Galaxy Ring), Reebok (the Reebok smart ring), Zepp Health (Amazfit ring), and Nexxbase (the Luna Ring).

Hair dryers, curlers, steamers — you name it, there’s probably a TikTokker shilling for the latest hair gadget that will totally revolutionize a hair routine. Even so, I was excited to get a demo of L’Oréal’s Light Straight at CES 2026.\n\nIt’s an extension of the tech that L’Oréal introduced at CES 2024 with the Airlight Pro hairdryer. In a nutshell, most conventional hair styling tools rely on heated coils and motors. The Airlight Pro hairdryer introduced infrared light to help speed up drying while reducing the overall heat required. (I’ve been doing some long-term testing of the high-tech hair dryer versus a standard one over the past year, and I can confirm that it is much faster.)\n\nThe Light Straight uses the same tech, but in a flat iron form. The proposed benefit is the ability to straighten or curl hair with one pass, using less heat. Typical hair styling tools can exceed 400 degrees Fahrenheit, but the Light Straight won’t go beyond 320 degrees. Altogether, the company says that should translate to three times faster styling and hair that’s two times smoother. Considering that styling can take forever — and lead to some crispy strands — saving time while also reducing damage is a compelling pitch.\n\nI didn’t get to try it on my own hair for hygienic reasons. I did, however, get to handle the device and see a robot arm curl and straighten a test strand of hair. The flat iron is relatively lightweight to hold and heats up quickly. In the demo, I was able to see the robot curl and then straighten hair with a single pass — but the resulting hair wasn’t too hot to the touch. It was an impressive demo, though we’ll have to see how the device performs on different hair types. L’Oréal told me that the device should work on most hair types, but it’s not going to change the fact that flat irons are easier to use on certain hair types over others.\n\nThe Light Straight is slated to arrive sometime in 2027, so we don’t yet know how much it’ll cost.

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.\n\nX’s Grok chatbot hasn’t stopped accepting users’ requests to strip down women and, in some cases, apparent minors to AI-generated bikinis. According to some reports, the flood of AI-generated images includes more extreme content that potentially violates laws against nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even in the US, where X owner Elon Musk has close ties with the government, some legislators are criticizing the platform — though clear action is still in short supply.\n\nSeveral international regulators have spoken out against Grok’s undressing spree. The UK communications regulator Ofcom said in a statement that it had “made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK,” and would quickly assess “potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said at a press conference that Grok’s outputs were “illegal” and “appalling.” India’s IT ministry threatened to strip X’s legal immunity for user-generated posts unless it promptly submitted a description of actions it’s taken to prevent illegal content. Regulators from Australia, Brazil, France, and Malaysia are also tracking the developments.\n\nTech platforms in the US are largely protected from liability for their users’ posts under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but even the co-author of the 1996 law, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), said the rule should not protect a company’s own AI outputs. “Given that the Trump administration is going to the mat to protect pedophiles, states should step in to hold Musk and X accountable,” Wyden wrote on Bluesky.\n\nSome of the images created by Grok could also violate the Take It Down Act. Under that law, the DOJ now has authority to try to impose criminal penalties against individuals who publish even AI-facilitated NCII, while platforms that fail to quickly remove flagged content could be targeted by the Federal Trade Commission starting in mid-May.\n\nGrok’s large-scale sexual image generation appears to be exactly the kind of thing that the Take It Down Act was designed to deal with. “X must change this,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), a lead sponsor of the bill, wrote on the platform. “If they don’t, my bipartisan TAKE IT DOWN Act will soon require them to.” Phoebe Keller, spokesperson for Klobuchar’s co-sponsor, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), declined to comment on the reporting about Grok.\n\nSome lawmakers are calling for new targeted legislation. Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) called Grok’s behavior “grotesque” in a statement and said his proposal, the Deepfake Liability Act, would “make hosting sexualized deepfakes of women and kids a Board-level problem for Musk & [Meta CEO Mark] Zuckerberg.”\n\nBut other lawmakers insist that enforcers already have the tools to deal with Grok’s actions. “Attorney General [Pam] Bondi has a simple choice: protect the President’s Big Tech friends or defend the young people of America,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said in a statement.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that software used by the federal government is vulnerable to such heinous and illegal uses”\n\nRep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA), who helped lead the House version of the Take It Down Act, said in a statement that she is “horrified and disgusted by reports that Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot has flooded the internet with AI-generated explicit images of women and children.” Dean called on Bondi and FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson to “launch an immediate investigation into Grok and xAI to protect our children, ensure this never happens again, and bring these perpetrators to justice.” Nearly eight months after the Take It Down Act’s signing, she said, “it’s unacceptable that software used by the federal government is vulnerable to such heinous and illegal uses.”\n\nBut critics of the Take It Down Act — including the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), which has long pushed for criminalizing the spread of NCII — have warned for months that Donald Trump’s administration could use the law to punish its enemies while laxly enforcing it against allies like Musk and X. Trump’s FTC has been largely silent on the recent X controversy. The agency did not respond to The Verge’s request for comment. Department of Justice spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre, however, said in a statement that it “takes AI-generated child sex abuse material extremely seriously and will aggressively prosecute any producer or possessor of CSAM.”\n\nAbsent federal action in the US, state attorneys general could still investigate X for actions that might harm their own residents. It’s not yet public if any such probes are underway. California Department of Justice spokesperson Elissa Perez would not confirm or deny the existence of any potential or ongoing investigations, but wrote that Attorney General Rob Bonta “is deeply concerned about the harms of chatbots and remains committed to ensuring AI safety, especially when it comes to protecting California’s children.” She said Bonta has been “very involved” in such efforts, “including by supporting state legislation aiming to protect children from AI companion chatbots and by directly engaging with AI companies.” California law forbids the production and distribution of content showing minors engaged in or mimicking sexual conduct, including AI-generated depictions.\n\nNew Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, whose office has filed several prominent lawsuits against major tech companies, is another potential candidate for action. “We are extremely concerned about recent reports of various AI platforms, including Grok, which lack basic safeguards to ensure that their users do not violate the dignity and privacy rights of others, especially children,” Torrez said in a statement. “As with social media, we will intend to aggressively police this space and use every available tool at our disposal to hold technology companies accountable for the harm presented by these products.” Geoff Burgan, a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James, said their office is also reviewing the Grok incidents.\n\n“Elon Musk is laughing about people being victimized by his platform”\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration and some Republican allies in Congress have been pushing to block states from enforcing their own laws regulating the use of AI, via a recent executive order and multiple so-far failed attempts to codify the restrictions into law. “While the White House works with Republicans to try to stop states from regulating AI, Grok is churning out sexualized images of women and children,” House Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone (D-NJ) said in a statement. “Let’s be clear, Elon Musk is laughing about people being victimized by his platform and President Trump decided to invite him to dinner. Protecting victims is clearly not a priority for either of them.”\n\nAt least one Republican criticized X’s proliferation of the images, though her solution in part includes making Trump’s AI executive order into law. “No AI chatbot should distribute this harmful content, and the company must take immediate action to tighten its guardrails and ensure Grok cannot violate its terms of service by creating these images,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), a co-author of the Kids Online Safety Act, said in a statement. Blackburn has previewed her own legislation she says would codify Trump’s executive order by creating a federal framework for AI legislation, called the TRUMP AMERICA AI Act. “This is exactly why Congress must take action to pass legislation that protects children online.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T16:09:54-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T21:29:54.725199"}

But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT.\n\nIf people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.\n\nWithin Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.\n\nChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.\n\nThe CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in a blog post that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.\n\nWhile the healthcare system has its drawbacks, using AI chatbots for medical advice creates a new slew of challenges.

It does an excellent job of tuning out all but the highest pitch noises.\n\nThey sound great across a variety of genres, with boosted highs and lows that can be a bit much at times, and nice detail and immediacy for earbuds. They're a great fit for working out or getting yard work done, thanks to boosted highs and lows that assist the ANC, and in particular sound great with pop, hip-hop, and bright jazz.\n\nApple's close integration of hardware and software means these can also pull off some neat tricks, like real-time translation. When paired with any iPhone with Apple Intelligence, you can speak a variety of languages into the phone, and the earbuds will translate them to your own. They also have heartrate sensing, which we found surprisingly accurate. Other headphones have similar features, but getting them all in one place, along with quick pairing and Siri compatibility, helps these feel like the full package.\n\nWhile they look largely the same as the second generation, there were some improvements to the fit that anyone with smaller ears will appreciate. The ear tips are thicker too, with a foam layer that helps with sound isolation and noise reduction. They're more durable, with an IP57 rating that will go everywhere with you except into the pool.\n\nWhile I'm often tempted by the deals I cover, as a devout Android user, I'll be keeping my wallet in my pocket today.

However, that’s not the only way people have been using the AI to generate sexualized images. Grok’s website and app, which are are separate from X, include sophisticated video generation that is not available on X and is being used to produce extremely graphic, sometimes violent, sexual imagery of adults that is vastly more explicit than images created by Grok on X. It may also have been used to create sexualized videos of apparent minors.\n\nUnlike on X, where Grok’s output is public by default, images and videos created on the Grok app or website using its Imagine model are not shared openly. If a user has shared an Imagine URL, though, it may be visible to anyone. A cache of around 1,200 Imagine links, plus a WIRED review of those either indexed by Google or shared on a deepfake porn forum, shows disturbing sexual videos that are vastly more explicit than images created by Grok on X.\n\nOne photorealistic Grok video, hosted on Grok.com, shows a fully naked AI-generated man and woman, covered in blood across the body and face, having sex, while two other naked women dance in the background. The video is framed by a series of images of anime-style characters. Another photorealistic video includes an AI-generated naked woman with a knife inserted into her genitalia, with blood appearing on her legs and the bed.\n\nOther short videos include imagery of real-life female celebrities engaged in sexual activities, and a series of videos also appear to show television news presenters lifting up their tops to expose their breasts. One Grok-produced video depicts a recording of CCTV footage being played on TV, where a security guard fondles a topless woman in the middle of a shopping mall.\n\nMultiple videos—likely created to try to avoid Grok’s content safety systems, which may restrict graphic content—impersonate Netflix “movie” posters: Two videos show a naked AI depiction of Diana, Princess of Wales, having sex with two men on a bed with an overlay depicting the logos of Netflix and its series The Crown.\n\nAround 800 of the archived Imagine URLs contain either video or images created by Grok, says Paul Bouchaud, the lead researcher at the Paris-based nonprofit AI Forensics, who reviewed the content. The URLs have all been archived since August last year and represent only a tiny snapshot of how people have used Grok, which has likely created millions of images overall.\n\n“They are overwhelmingly sexual content,” Bouchaud says of the cache of 800 archived Grok videos and images. “Most of the time it’s manga and hentai explicit content and [other] photorealistic ones. We have full nudity, full pornographic videos with audio, which is quite novel.”\n\nBouchaud estimates that of the 800 posts, a little less than 10 percent of the content appears to be related to child sexual abuse material (CSAM). “Most of the time it's hentai, but there are also instances of photorealistic people, very young, doing sexual activities,” Bouchaud says. “We still do observe some videos of very young-appearing women undressing and engaging in activities with men,” they say. “It's disturbing to another level.”\n\nThe researcher says they reported around 70 Grok URLs, which may contain sexualized content of minors, to regulators in Europe. In many countries, AI-generated CSAM, including drawings or animations, can be considered illegal.

But the CEO tells us it wasn't for the reasons many thought.", "content": "Over the past few days, several posts on LinkedIn and Twitter went viral after one of the most talked about AI companies in San Francisco suddenly vanished from LinkedIn: Artisan AI.\n\nThe company’s LinkedIn page, individual employee profiles, and posts from executives all displayed a “This post cannot be displayed” message.\n\nThe startup had been banned from the site, Artisan CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack confirmed to TechCrunch. However, after working with LinkedIn over the past two weeks — and addressing the social network’s concerns — Artisan is now being reinstated.\n\n“Every startup inevitably has some kind of thing that comes back to bite them [from things] that they do early on,” Carmichael-Jack said.\n\nContrary to what the rumors in the viral posts said, LinkedIn did not ban the company because its AI agents were spamming users. LinkedIn did, however, object to the startup using LinkedIn’s name on its website and also alleged that the company was using data brokers who had scraped the site without permission, Carmichael-Jack said. Data scraping is a violation of LinkedIn’s terms of service.\n\nArtisan AI is graduate of startup accelerator Y Combinator and became one of San Francisco’s buzziest startups via its “Stop hiring humans” billboards posted around town. Artisan offers an AI agent it calls Ava that does outbound sales by finding and contacting potential customers. LinkedIn is famously precious turf for outbound marketing salespeople – both human and, increasingly, AI.\n\nWhile a couple of LinkedIn users seemed to notice Artisan’s ban about a week ago, the posts and tweets about it really picked up steam this week.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nCarmichael-Jack explained that LinkedIn’s “enforcement team reached out to us, and they basically restricted our accounts completely, so we disappeared from the platform whilst they were reviewing it, which was not ideal. But it was kind of funny, because once we were restricted, our lead flow suddenly started inching up every day. And I think it’s because, obviously, so many people were posting about it.”\n\nAs a founder who likes a good guerrilla marketing scheme, he joked, “I wish we’d done it on purpose.”\n\nThe truth was he was shocked to get an email from LinkedIn on Friday evening, December 19, right before the Christmas holiday. Carmichael-Jack described the team handling the ban as helpful and responsive, even if they were also anonymous and only reachable by email.\n\nTo appease LinkedIn, Artisan removed all mentions of LinkedIn from its website. It was using the name to compare some of its data features to LinkedIn’s. The CEO also got a crash course in third-party vendor verification, ensuring that his data partners were operating in compliance with LinkedIn’s policies.\n\nWhile Carmichael-Jack is happy to be back on the Microsoft-owned social network, he downplayed how damaging being booted off would have been, saying very little of the data Artisan uses comes from the site. He’s also about to release a new version of the agent that is more autonomous and can use more channels for contacting prospects.\n\n“We can work around anything. We’re launching dialing as a channel in a few months – outbound calling,” so if the LinkedIn ban could not have been reversed, “it wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said.\n\nInterestingly, LinkedIn isn’t a direct competitor. It did launch its first AI agent last year called Hiring Assistant, but it is focused on recruiting. Still, that LinkedIn went nuclear on Artisan could signal that a sales agent could one day be in its pipeline, too.

Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024.\n\nThese days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.\n\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\n\nM4 MacBook Air\n\nIn March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.\n\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts, too. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $799 ($200 off), which is just $50 shy of its lowest price to date. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which remains its second-best price to date.\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\n\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\n\nIn November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\n\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.\n\nMany variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage (10-core CPU / 10-core GPU) is available for $1,499 ($300 off) at B&H Photo. You can also pick up the 14-inch MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) at Amazon and B&H Photo for around $1,749 ($250 off), which is a solid discount even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.\n\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,239 ($260 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is $110 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.\n\nM5 MacBook Pro\n\nApple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.\n\nThe 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date.\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\n\nThe newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\n\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\n\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\n\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\n\nIn the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s only on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $539 ($60 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $729 ($70 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,289 ($110 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\n\nUpdate, January 7th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability. We also removed a handful of deals on models we no longer recommend at the current price, including the M1 MacBook Air.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T17:59:01-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T23:27:09.676047"}

The findings, first reported in Science, could be the first time scientists have identified DNA from da Vinci himself.\n\nThe DNA\n\nHistorical artifacts can accumulate DNA from the environment and potentially offer useful information about the people who created and handled them. Gathering that material on such precious objects without damaging or contaminating them, though, is a complex challenge. Today, decisions about the authorship of a work depend on expert opinion—for example, on how a brushstroke was created.\n\nThe LDVP researchers therefore used an extremely gentle swabbing method to attempt to collect biological material. They then extracted small amounts of DNA, which provided useful information. \"We recovered heterogeneous mixtures of non-human DNA,\" states the study published in the preprint journal bioRxiv, “and, in a subset of samples, sparse male-specific human DNA signals.”\n\nThe da Vinci Clue\n\nFrom the analysis the researchers concluded that they found the closest match within the broad E1b1b lineage on the Y chromosome (whose sections are passed on almost unchanged from father to son) that is now commonly found in southern Europe, Africa, and parts of the Middle East. Some of the DNA, they say, may have come from Leonardo da Vinci himself.\n\n“Across multiple independent swabs from Leonardo da Vinci-associated items, the obtained Y chromosome marker data suggested assignments within the broader E1b1/E1b1b clade,” the study reads. The results also indicate mixed DNA contributions assocaited with the source materials, though, consistent with modern handling.\n\n“Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility as well as limitations of combining metagenomics and human DNA marker analysis for cultural heritage science,\" the paper reads, \"providing a baseline workflow for future conservation science studies and hypothesis-driven investigations of provenance, authentication and handling history.”\n\nFurther Investigation\n\nWhile the researches have demonstrated an innovative approach, they acknowledge that they didn't come back with conclusive evidence. Although the data suggest that the DNA could be Leonardo da Vinci's, asserting that any trace of DNA in the artifacts actually belongs to him is very complpicated. “Establishing an unequivocal identity ... is extremely complex,” David Caramelli, an anthropologist at the University of Florence and LDVP member, told Science.\n\nThis is because scientists cannot verify the genetic sequences of the artifacts by comparing them with DNA known to have been taken from Leonardo da Vinci himself; there are still no confirmed samples. Moreover, da Vinci had no known direct descendants, and his burial site was breached in the early 19th century. Encouraged by the first clue about da Vinci's DNA, LDVP scientists now hope to convince the custodians of Leonardo's works and notebooks to allow them further sampling that could solve the case.\n\nThis story originally appeared in WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:23:29 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T23:27:10.222432"}

Over the last few years, General Catalyst unveiled a wealth management business, a strategy focused on PE-style AI roll-ups, and a Customer Value Fund (CVF), which provides late-stage startups with non-dilutive financing secured by recurring revenue.\n\nOther recent General Catalyst departures include Deep Nishar and Kyle Doherty, who co-led the late-stage ‘Endurance’ strategy, and Adam Valkin, who co-led the early-stage fund alongside Bonatsos and Trevor Oelschig, TechCrunch reported last year.\n\nUnlike his former colleagues, who declined to comment about their departures, Bonatsos described his exit as a mutual decision, saying that his time at GC was an “awesome experience” which provided many “learnings.”\n\nBonatsos said he has yet to choose a name for his new firm or begin fundraising. He declined to specify the size of his team, noting only that the individuals he is considering include founders and investors “at the top of their game.”\n\nSome of the themes Bonatsos intends to pursue include backing young founders, a trend he claims to have identified several years ago, before it became popular in the industry. Indeed, many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young and include college dropouts like Mercor’s founder, Brendan Foody.\n\nBonatsos is also interested in investing in founders who are launching consumer businesses, a sector he views as “underappreciated” in a market saturated with enterprise-focused AI startups.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

It was the first in a series of increasing bets. On January 3rd, the US bombed the Venezuelan capital, kidnapped Maduro and his wife, and killed at least 80 people along the way. The account cashed out with almost half a million dollars.\n\nIt would be a misread to describe the surprise invasion of Venezuela as imperial expansion driven by the dictates of capitalism; it is, somehow, worse. Normal capitalism requires a working relationship with reality. Normal capitalism thrives on predictability. The Trump administration is behaving like gambling addicts chasing clout in an attention economy. Venezuela is a fucking meme stock.\n\nAmerica produces the most ghoulish capitalists in the world, and not even they want this\n\nThen there’s Donald Trump saying he consulted oil companies on the invasion — but the same execs are denying that they knew. In Trump’s defense, a Politico report quotes an anonymous petroleum “industry official” saying that there had been an “offer” from the administration on the table for 10 days prior to the attack on Caracas. “They’re saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed.’” But the oil companies, according to the insider, are awfully ambivalent about an entire sovereign nation being annexed to their supposed benefit — “the infrastructure currently there is so dilapidated that no one at these companies can adequately assess what is needed to make it operable.” Another source said that overtures from the Trump administration had been “relatively flatly received” by the industry.\n\nAmerica produces the most ghoulish capitalists in the world, and not even they want this. The oil companies are leery about Venezuela because they are aware that the oil there is sour crude, which “requires significant refining” — in other words, complex and expensive infrastructure rather than the decades-old shambles that’s there.\n\nHence the incredible suggestion from Trump on Monday that the US government might subsidize the restoration of oil infrastructure. The whole affair reeks of desperation, like Elon Musk haggling with Stephen King over the price of X Premium. Capital is being lured into justifying the propaganda, rather than the other way around.\n\nWe have now arrived at the logical end state of financial nihilism. Meme stocks are sentiment only; whatever happens to the underlying company is irrelevant at best to what happens with the stock price. And despite the death toll, this administration is treating the war on Venezuela as all sentiment, in-jokes, and degen memes. That’s why the war room (war nook?) is just a big TV screen of X.com and war profiteering now consists of Polymarket bets.\n\nThis is Wag the Dog staged by idiots who have themselves gotten confused about the difference between image and reality. Real people are dead because a number of powerful people in the US live in a sadistic fantasy, chasing a gambler’s high.\n\nPerhaps you are thinking, “Surely it cannot be legal to suddenly bomb a country, kidnap its head of state, and annex it? All in the dead of night? Surely not?” If such doubts are running through your mind, you’re in good company — in its judgment in the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal declared that a war of aggression “is the supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.”\n\nAs with all meme stocks, enthusiasm for the Venezuela operation exists in an echo chamber. YouGov polling in the wake of the bombing says that more Americans disapprove than approve of Trump’s handling of Venezuela; in the lead-up, support for military action was “scant.” But a lot of very powerful people have had their brains completely cooked by the rogue internet forum known as X, and can’t even tell how out of touch they are.\n\nEnthusiasm for the Venezuela operation exists in an echo chamber\n\nA tiny fraction of world leaders expressed their wholehearted approval for the Venezuela operation, and they mostly went to X’s echo chamber to do it. “To all the narco chavista criminals, your time is coming. Your structure will completely collapse across the entire continent,” posted Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa. “Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump for your bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice,” posted Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes.\n\nIn contrast, when Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro took to X right after the bombings to express “deep concern” and Colombia’s “commitment” to the UN Charter, he was met with trolling, including from platform owner Elon Musk. Musk has spent the last few days reposting crypto influencers praising the war in Venezuela, including a post by @WallStreetApes with a video that is tagged as AI generated and misleading.\n\nKnowing all this clarifies why an anonymous “centrist House Democrat” might tell Axios that “if you don’t acknowledge when there is a win for our country, then you lose all credibility,” saying they were surprised at “how negative the response has been” from other Democrats. This is not consistent with actual polling. Americans at large do not like the Venezuela operation, but maybe more relevantly for a Democratic politician, Democrats really don’t like it. Being “surprised” here is terminal X brain; these are the words of someone who has been infected by the same brainworm as the White House.\n\nRubio, on the other hand, has spent the last few days insisting that there’s no war, that “this wasn’t an invasion,” that the US is merely going to be “running policy” in Venezuela rather than actually “run” it, and that Maduro “was an illegitimate leader.” These are the mealy-mouthed sophistries of someone who is aware of international law, and is desperately threading the needle.\n\nRegardless of the deranged, insular fandom of X.com, most of the rest of the world is very much not on board\n\nThis is with good reason. Regardless of the deranged, insular fandom of X.com, most of the rest of the world is very much not on board. After the initial bombings, a number of countries across the world released carefully phrased official statements. Leaders called for “respect” for international law (Peru, Canada, Denmark, the European Commission) or reiterated their own recognition of international law (Bolivia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore).\n\nOther countries refused to mince words. A joint statement by Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and Spain stated that “the military actions carried out unilaterally in the territory of Venezuela … contravene fundamental principles of international law.” And when France’s Emmanuel Macron omitted mention of international law in his official statement (on X), other French officials rushed out to flatly emphasize that the Venezuela operation violated international law.\n\nMeanwhile, Argentinian president and crypto hypeman Javier Milei went on a posting bender, excitedly reposting anyone criticizing international law, boosting claims that the international legal regime did not care about Maduro’s own tyrannical acts while he was in power.\n\nThis would probably be news to Maduro, as there is an ongoing probe into human rights violations alleged to have taken place as far back as 2014 in Venezuela, shortly after he first took power. Just two weeks before Caracas was bombed and Maduro was kidnapped, the Venezuelan government made an earnest attempt to withdraw from the Rome Statute, the treaty that binds its signatories to the authority — as well as protection — of the International Criminal Court. It’s not a terrible leap to assume that Maduro and his allies thought the ICC might be coming for him, and that they had better make like George W. Bush and extract themselves from the strictures of international law — just the sort of idea that appeals to all war criminals right up until the war crimes are done unto them.\n\nTrump is now setting fire to the UN Charter, too\n\nWhat Trump has done in Venezuela is much bigger than the Rome Statute and specific atrocities it encompasses. It was not enough to set fire to the US Constitution; Trump is now setting fire to the UN Charter, too. If Trump is allowed to unilaterally declare Maduro’s illegitimacy and spirit him away in the night, then “that’s the end of international law, that’s the end of the U.N. charter, that’s the end of any kind of legal limits on the use of force,” as Yale Law School professor and international law scholar Oona Hathaway told The New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner.\n\nAnyone with a passing familiarity with US history is surely aware of the “not-wars” that the US has been doing for decades, especially in Latin America, where the greatest hits include the CIA assist of the 1973 Chilean coup d’état, the Iran-Contra affair in Nicaragua, and kidnapping General Manuel Noriega to force a regime change in Panama. (All three of these occurred in previous Republican administrations — Nixon, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, respectively.) But scholars agree that this is different, and that Maduro’s head-of-state immunity is no small detail. Even the interim leader of Venezuela, recognized by Trump, said Maduro is the country’s “only president” after she was sworn in.\n\nThe difference between now and then is far from academic. Our mad king has now taken to threatening other nations: Denmark (over Greenland), Mexico, Cuba, and Colombia. It seems he believes that if the US kidnaps a head of state, the US now runs that state.\n\nBut not even this Sid Meier’s Civilization view of the world can fully explain why things went down as they did. When the Trump administration kidnapped the Maduros, it was a serious geopolitical action that seemed engineered primarily to play on X. And X is indeed where it played out. The action makes the most sense if we assume the primary purpose of the Maduro kidnapping was to generate content. After all, US forces could simply have assassinated him. Instead, there will be more images of Maduro to release — including the perp walk. We learned this lesson over the course of the Forever Wars: There are plenty of images, content, and memes from the arrest of Saddam Hussein. By contrast, the murder of Osama bin Laden generated very little beyond conspiracy theories and a single photograph of President Barack Obama, Secretary Hillary Clinton, and others in the Situation Room.\n\nThe Trump administration even tried to engineer their own Situation Room photo, releasing black-and-white images of themselves in what appeared to be a makeshift sensitive compartmented information facility created by use of, uh, what appeared to be blackout curtains.\n\nA post by the president on TruthSocial.\n\nBut the X bubble’s addiction to content demanded more. Not satisfied with a real Maduro perp walk video, AI-generated images of fake perp walks flooded the platform. AI-generated videos of Venezuelans celebrating made the rounds. And the White House X account went so far as to post its own version of “Mission accomplished”: an obviously AI Trump scowling into the camera and ascending toward the viewer, captioned “FAFO,” an initialism for “fuck around and find out.”\n\nThis is the inevitable endpoint of terminal X brain. Well before the Venezuela bombings, Trump has heavily relied on AI to communicate with his supporters, including in ways that are likely to conflate fake videos and reality. The platform is rife with people treating signifiers as reality with their heavy use of AI. No representation of an actual event is needed to rile up the masses. The world is not that which is the case, the world is that which is content.\n\nIn 1953, B.F. Skinner — best known for changing the field of psychology forever by mindfucking a bunch of hapless pigeons — described “the pathological gambler” as “the victim of an unpredictable contingency of reinforcement,” akin to a pigeon contorting itself endlessly in the hopes of receiving unpredictable rewards. There is an argument made by some economists and Nate Silver that prediction markets are useful ways of telling the future because they let you know what smart people are willing to wager on. But these economists (pigeons) and Nate Silver (also a pigeon) haven’t accounted for the obvious: Being smart means getting treatment for your gambling addiction, not figuring out fun new ways to bet.\n\nWhen high-risk, high-payout bets on Polymarket or Kalshi have anything to do with reality, it is likely due to insider trading.\n\nTake, for instance, the account that won more than $1 million by placing bets on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings — getting 22 of 23 predictions right. That account’s other trades also revolved around Google, and in November, the account won $150,000 by correctly predicting the day that Google’s Gemini 3.0 would launch. It is possible, though unlikely, that someone simply has remarkably good intuition about what’s going on internally at Google. The obvious answer is that an insider got themselves a bonus.\n\nThe obvious answer is that an insider got themselves a bonus\n\nSome people have argued that this is good, actually — because it means information becomes public faster. “If your goal, for 99 percent of people, is to get a signal about what’s happening in the world, you actually want insider information,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at the NYT DealBook Summit. Why anyone might want to provide liquidity to a market that is stacked against them isn’t made clear. (The answer is that gambling is addictive, and casinos need pigeons.) Nor is it clear that this is the most effective way to make information public. But Armstrong effectively runs a gambling platform, so his incentives are, you know, to promote gambling.\n\nPrediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi also create an incentive to do the opposite of spreading good information. In November, a live map tracking the war in Ukraine showed a Russian advance on Myrnohrad on November 15th for just long enough for a Polymarket bet to resolve. The edit was fake, and disappeared after the bet paid out.\n\nIt is not difficult to see how prediction markets create other kinds of perverse incentives. One question on Kalshi as of this writing involves the number of measles cases this year. A possible outcome is someone betting on “above 10,000” and then unleashing biological warfare. Another is “When will Tim Cook leave Apple?” — a question that can be effectively resolved via murder. (The ’90s dream of assassination markets is alive and well on the blockchain!) Sports gambling at least limits such cheating to athletes throwing games; prediction markets’ questions such as “how far will a California wildfire spread” can be influenced by gamblers aiding the fires or hindering efforts to suppress them. All of these hypotheticals make Ukraine war misinformation seem positively benign.\n\nIn the case of Maduro, it’s not clear how widespread the information about the kidnapping was before it occurred. Perhaps Trump is telling the truth, and he did consult oil companies before the operation — in which case, an oil exec (or their assistant) might have made the bet. But if that information was restricted to the Trump administration, the picture gets much worse. That official would have had financial incentive to kidnap Maduro even if it were not in the best interests of the US as a whole. That is the pinnacle of financial nihilism — gambling markets setting political policy. Instead of Blood for Oil, we have Blood for Stonks.\n\nOne reason it is nearly impossible for Kalshi or Polymarket to do anything about such trades is that these markets are effectively anonymous. There is no “know your consumer” protocol, and no way to enforce a policy against insider trading, even if the prediction market had one. Polymarket does not, and its CEO, Shayne Coplan, has called insider trading “cool.” Currently, the company is busy denying that the kidnapping of a head of state amounts to an invasion, refusing to pay out on one of its prediction contracts unless the US military controls part or all of Venezuela.\n\nDivorcing the real-world outcomes from the hype machine effectively makes Venezuela a meme stock\n\nDivorcing the real-world outcomes from the hype machine effectively makes Venezuela a meme stock, complete with a mechanism for gambling in the form of prediction markets. And the X hype machine is operating in exactly the same way it does for meme stocks and crypto, acting to pump up the legitimacy of the operation with a fire hose of jokes, misinformation, and in-group shibboleths. It’s no wonder that the likes of Elon Musk and Javier Milei are furiously posting and reposting in support of the Venezuela operation; these are men who are particularly prone to boosterism for financial flim-flam, whether it’s dogecoin or Libra. Posting through this is second nature.\n\nAs of this writing, there is now a Polymarket bet on whether the US will make another strike on Venezuela, as well as “US strike on Colombia by...?” and “Will Trump acquire Greenland before 2027?” While it is a little funny to imagine the heads of various intelligence services monitoring outlier bets on Kalshi and Polymarket to find out whether the Trump administration really plans to invade Greenland, it also suggests that America’s political apparatus is riddled with gambling-addled Kim Philbys. People have been leaking secrets on War Thunder forums for online cred for years now. What happens when there’s real money at stake?\n\nIt won’t matter that economic analysis by the government of Greenland concluded that oil drilling would “either deliver low profits or make a loss.” It won’t matter that it is “unclear” whether mining for the rare earth metals under its ice is even “economically viable,” due to the complexity of processing those minerals, not to mention the pervasive lack of transportation infrastructure. It won’t matter that invading Greenland would explode NATO, sending the entire global economy into a tailspin. Polymarket will still pay out, assuming you are sufficiently careful about the definition of little words like “invasion.”\n\nIn the alternate reality constructed by keyboard sycophants, crypto influencers, and Grok, Trump has won a war and is running an enthusiastic, cheering Venezuela. But though Maduro is now in US custody, the regime has not actually changed. Maduro’s own vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, has taken over the country as interim leader with Trump’s approval. Francisco Santos Calderón, Colombia’s former vice president, has accused Rodríguez of orchestrating an inside job: “I’m absolutely certain Delcy Rodríguez handed him over. All the information we have, you start to put it together and say: ‘Oh, this was an operation in which they handed him over.’”\n\nWhatever happened behind the scenes, the de facto result approximates the outcome of a coup d’état, giving the lie to the hype about liberating Venezuela from an illegitimate leader. In 2024, Edmundo González ran for president in place of opposition leader María Corina Machado, who had been banned from appearing on the ballot. González almost certainly won that election, and did so as a reflection of popular support for Machado. (Right after the bombing of Caracas, Polymarket betting on whether Machado would be recognized as the new leader spiked upward.) But Trump apparently resents Machado for winning the Nobel Peace Prize and has no intention of having her or González take office. In a recent Fox News interview, Machado offered to share her Nobel with Trump, marking a new nadir in the embarrassing history of the Peace Prize; Polymarket now rates her chances at about 1 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, shortly after taking the reins, Rodríguez gave a speech on television saying “we will never return to being the colony of another empire.” This prompted Trump to respond with a wild threat: “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”\n\nEven on the face of it, Trump’s fantasy is absurd: How, for instance, will the US “run” Venezuela when it has no troops or diplomats in the country? Much to Trump’s chagrin, Rodríguez is breaking kayfabe — probably because she lives in the real Venezuela and has to deal with real Venezuelans.\n\nMaybe that’s why Trump is sliding back into what he knows best: bribery and extortion. Recently, in a Truth Social post, he announced that “the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil to the United States of America.” The oil will be sold, and any proceeds “will be controlled by me, the President of the United States of America.” Can’t wait to see how Congress, the legislative body that theoretically controls the nation’s purse strings, will respond to this. Perhaps they will confirm another cabinet member.\n\nMeme stocks run on hype, self-deception, and deregulation, and because of their very nature — hollow, nihilistic financial instruments dressed up as jokes — the majority of people who participate wind up losers. The action in Venezuela is destined to end in American humiliation, one way or another. The only real question is how much it will cost us, in lost lives and in broken alliances, before we realize all our apes gone.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T18:38:18-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-07T23:57:55.873213"}

The day-to-day discounts come and go like changing winds, so there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s most affordable iPad, the iPad Mini, and the latest iPad Air. Hell, you can even often find discounts on the latest M5 iPad Pro, which is already on sale at multiple retailers. If you don’t need the latest tech, though, now may be a good time to save on the M4 Pro as inventory dwindles.\n\nAll that being said, it’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 11th-gen base iPad to the more powerful models with M3 and M4 chips.\n\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\n\nApple’s 11th-gen iPad landed on the scene in March. The newest base model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model, but with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and the A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip used in the 10th-gen iPad. However, the newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1 and subsequent updates. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.\n\nPricing-wise, the latest iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We saw a pretty significant price drop to $279 during Black Friday; however, right now, it’s only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for around $299, saving you $50. Alternatively, you can purchase the 256GB model for around $399 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, or the 512GB variant for around $599 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\n\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\n\nThe seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar in several ways to the previous model, but comes with some big internal upgrades. It includes faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.\n\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, so the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\n\nRight now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy in select colors starting at $389.99 ($110 off), which is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen in recent months (it previously dropped to $379). If you need additional storage, you can pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon and Best Buy for $499 ($100 off), or the 512GB model at Amazon and Best Buy in select colors starting at $679.99 ($120 off).\n\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\n\nThe 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer into the future than either the entry-level iPad or the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, plus compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard that has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys. In short, the Air is a credible laptop replacement.\n\nThe 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as prior models — but it’s common to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $489.99, which is $110 off and essentially matches its median sale price (Best Buy also has it for $10 more). You can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $599.99 ($100 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $789 ($110 off).\n\nThe larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage for around $699 ($100 off), which is $50 shy of its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $789 ($110 off) or the 512GB variant at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $999 ($100 off), neither of which matches the lows we saw toward the end of last year.\n\nThe best iPad Pro (2025) deals\n\nWhile there are some deals floating around for the M4 iPad Pro, we’d argue none of them are particularly noteworthy given the current discounts on the 2025 iPad Pro. Apple’s latest high-end tablet offers a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including a faster M5 chip, a new C1X cellular modem (if you get the cellular version), and an N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. Apple also increased read and write speeds to memory, and the latest Pro supports fast charging, allowing you to charge it to 50 percent capacity in about 30 minutes.\n\nAlthough the tablet launched in October, we’re already seeing the price drop at several retailers. The 11-inch base model with 256GB of storage is currently down to around $899 ($100 off) at Amazon, for instance, while the model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $1,099 ($100 off). You can also snag the configuration with Wi-Fi and 1TB of storage for $1,499.99 (about $100 off) at Amazon.\n\nIf you want a larger display, you can get the 13-inch iPad Pro in its 256GB base configuration for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon, which is the lowest price we’ve seen on the premium 13-incher. The step-up model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage, meanwhile, is down to $1,399.99 (about $100 off) at Amazon, while the Wi-Fi model with 1TB of storage can be had for $1,785 ($114 off) at Amazon.\n\nUpdate, January 7th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability. We also removed a handful of deals on models we no longer recommend at the current price, specifically those for the M4 iPad Pro.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T19:01:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T02:24:09.318980"}

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nFord’s new AI-powered voice assistant will be rolling out to customers later this year, the company’s top software executive said at CES today. And in 2028, the automaker will introduce a hands-free, eyes-off Level 3 autonomous driving feature as part of its more affordable (and hopefully more profitable) Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform, set to launch in 2027.\n\nMost importantly, Ford said it would be developing a lot of the core technology around these products in-house in order to reduce costs and retain greater control over. Mind you, the company isn’t creating its own large-language models or designing its own silicon, like Tesla and Rivian. Instead, it will be building its own electronic and computer modules that are smaller and more efficient than the systems that are currently in place.\n\n“By designing our own software and hardware in-house, we’ve found a way to make this technology more affordable,” Ford’s chief officer for EVs and software Doug Field wrote in a blog post. “This means we can put advanced hands-free driving into the vehicles people actually buy, not just vehicles with unattainable price points.”\n\nFord said it would be developing a lot of the core technology around these products in-house\n\nThe new comes as Ford faces increasing pressure to roll out more affordable EVs after its big bet on electric versions of the Mustang and F-150 pickup truck failed to excite customers or make a profit. The company recently cancelled the F-150 Lightning amid cooling EV sales, and said it would make more hybrid vehicles as well as battery storage systems to meet growing demand from AI data center construction. Ford also has been recalibrating its AI strategy after shutting down its autonomous vehicle program with Argo AI in 2022, pivoting from fully autonomous Level 4 vehicles to Level 2 and Level 3 conditional autonomous driver assist features.\n\nAmid all this, the company is trying to stake out a middle ground on AI: not going all-in on a robot army like Tesla and Hyundai, while still committing to some AI-powered products, like voice assistants and automated driving features.\n\nFord said its AI assistant will launch on the Ford and Lincoln mobile apps in 2026, before expanding to the in-car experience in 2027. An example would be a Ford owner standing in a hardware, unsure how many bags of mulch will fit in the bed of their truck. The owner could snap a photo of the mulch and ask the assistant, who could respond with a more accurate answer than, say, ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, because it all the information about the owner’s vehicle, including truck bed size and trim level.\n\nAt a recent tech conference, Ford’s CFO Sherry House said Ford would be integrating Google’s Gemini into its vehicles. That said, the automaker is designing its assistant to be chatbot-agnostic, meaning it will work with a variety of different LLMs.\n\nAmid all this, the company is trying to stake out a middle ground on AI.\n\n“The key part is that we take this LLM, and then we give it access to all the relevant Ford systems so that LLM then knows about what specific vehicle you’re using,” Sammy Omari, Ford’s head of ADAS and infotainment, told me.\n\nAutonomous driving features will come later with the launch of Ford’s Universal EV Platform. Ford’s flagship product right now is BlueCruise, its hands-free Level 2 driver assist feature that’s only available on most highways. Ford plans on rolling out a point-to-point hands-free system that can recognize traffic lights and navigate intersections. And then eventually it will launch a Level 3 system where the driver still needs to be able to take over the vehicle upon request but can also take their eyes off the road in certain situations. (Some experts have argued that L3 systems can be dangerous given the need for drivers to stay attentive despite the vehicle performing most of the driving tasks.)\n\nOmari explained that by rigorously scrutinizing every sensor, software component, and compute unit, the team has achieved a system that is approximately 30 percent lower cost than today’s hands-free system, while delivering significantly more capability.\n\nAll of this will depend on a “radical rethink” of Ford’s computing architecture, Field said in the blog post. That means a more unified “brain” that can process infotainment, ADAS, voice commands, and more.\n\nFor almost a decade, Ford has been building a team with the relevant expertise to spearhead these projects. The former Argo AI team, originally focused on Level 4 robotaxi development, was brought on board the mothership for their expertise in machine learning, robotics, and software. And a team of BlackBerry engineers, who were initially hired in 2017, is now working on building next-generation electronic modules to enable some of these innovations, Paul Costa, executive director of Ford’s electronics platforms, told me.\n\nBut Ford doesn’t want to get into “a TOPS arms race,” Costa added, referring to the metric for measuring AI processor’s speed in trillions of operations a second. Other companies, like Tesla and Rivian, have stressed the processing speed of their AI chips to prove how powerful their automated driving systems will be. Ford’s not interested in playing that game.\n\nRather than optimizing for performance alone, they pursued a balance of performance, cost, and size. The result is a compute module that is significantly more powerful, lower in cost, and 44 percent smaller than the system it replaces.\n\n“We’re not just choosing one area here to optimize around at the expense of everything else,” Costa said. “We’ve actually been able to optimize across the board, and that’s why we’re so excited about it.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-07T19:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T02:24:09.525666"}

The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.\n\nWednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.”\n\nFord says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life.\n\nThe company is rolling the assistant out to its newly revamped Ford app in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing.\n\nFord didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers.\n\nJust last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.\n\nThe new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

And now, before this robotaxi joins Waymo’s official commercial fleet, it’s getting a new name, the company told TechCrunch.\n\nThe Zeekr RT robotaxi will now be named Ojai (pronounced “oh-hi”) — after the village in the Topatopa Mountains above Los Angeles that is known for its arts community and focus on wellness.\n\nWaymo’s official explanation, per spokesperson Chris Bonelli, is that the company determined the U.S. public isn’t familiar with the Zeekr brand. That branding may even carry through to the rider experience. Apparently, when customers eventually get into the Ojai, the robotaxi will greet them with an “Oh hi” and their name. Cute.\n\nOf course, in the U.S. it might not hurt to ditch the name of a Chinese automaker either.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Waymo first struck a partnership with Geely Holding Group-owned Zeekr in 2021. Waymo showed off a concept of a purpose-built robotaxi the following year at a splashy event in Los Angeles. The prototype was based on a version of Zeekr’s SEA-M architecture designed for “future mobility products” like robotaxis and logistics vehicles.\n\nNotably, the prototype didn’t have a steering wheel. But the Ojai one, which was shown off at CES 2026, does.\n\nThe Zeekr RT (now Ojai) has gone through some fine-tuning over the years as it has gone through development and testing in cities like Phoenix and San Francisco. Last year at CES, Waymo gave the robotaxi the now-retired name of Zeekr RT and showcased some of its hardware, including 13 cameras, four lidar, six radar, an array of external audio receivers, and the tiniest sensor wipers you’ve ever seen.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nVolvo is starting to trickle out some details about its upcoming midsize electric SUV, the EX60, before its official debut January 21st. The EX60 will have an estimated range of 400 miles (or 810km based on the generous WLTP standard in Europe). That’s significantly more range than any previous Volvo EV — at least until the 434-mile-range ES90 sedan comes out. And the EX60 will be the first vehicle to benefit from the automaker’s new megacasting production process to reduce weight and improve manufacturing efficiency.\n\n“One of the things that we wanted to do was to create an electric vehicle with no compromises,” Akhil Krishnan, head of program management for the EX60, told me. “It shouldn’t be a compromise for you to choose to drive electric, so that was very, very important for us.”\n\nTo that end, improving the vehicle’s range and charging time were chief among the goals of Krishnan and his team. They wanted to transform “range anxiety” into “range comfort,” meaning the driver would have so much range that it no longer becomes a hinderance — similar to how consumers don’t choose gasoline cars based on tank size.\n\nThe interior looks to be as quirky as Volvo’s other EVs, like the EX30 and EX90. Image: Volvo\n\nBut range alone is not enough; charging speed was also critical. Krishnan said that Volvo conducted extensive customer research and found that many EV owners felt forced to plan their lives around charging stops, often waiting 40 minutes or more. Volvo wanted the EX60 to fit into natural human breaks instead. For instance, if a driver stops for 10 minutes to get coffee or use the restroom, the car should be ready to go again within that time.\n\nThe EX60 should meet that standard thanks to its 800-volt architecture, a first for Volvo. Other automakers, like Hyundai and Kia, have stood out amid cooling demand for EVs thanks to their fast-charging, 800-volt-architecture vehicles, and now Volvo wants to do the same. The EX60 can charge from 10–80 percent in 19 minutes, or add 168 miles of range in just 10 minutes, when using a 400kW fast charger.\n\nBut range alone is not enough; charging speed was also critical\n\nOf course, finding a charger that can produce such speeds could be a problem, especially here in the US — but it’s certainly getting better. Krishnan said that Volvo’s aim is to deliver excellent charging performance not only on 400kW chargers but also on more common 250kW units.\n\nThe vehicle is built on Volvo’s new SPA3 platform, designed exclusively for electric vehicles, without any legacy constraints from combustion engines. The EX60 isn’t relying on any battery breakthroughs to achieve its improved range — the nickel-cobalt-manganese chemistry is the same as the rest of the EV lineup — but rather advancements in manufacturing, like megacasting and the use of a structural battery pack, to reduce weight and improve the vehicle’s integrity. It will also include battery preconditioning so the battery is at the right temperature for optimal charging to help sustain those higher speeds.\n\nMegacasting is about forming a single piece of the vehicle’s frame instead of welding together multiple pieces. Image: Volvo\n\nThe new platform enables not just weight savings but also cost reductions, with estimated component-level savings of 20–35 percent, helping keep pricing competitive with gas and hybrid equivalents, Krishnan said. Volvo has said it intends to price the EX60 at around the same as the XC60 plug-in hybrid, which right now starts at around $63,000.\n\nVolvo is also offering for the first time a global 10-year battery warranty covering up to 240,000km. This extends the company’s previous eight-year coverage and, according to Krishnan, reflects confidence in its in-house battery development and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThe EX60 will have other tricks up its sleeve, too, including vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid functionality as standard across all markets and trims. Volvo has already announced a partnership with Swedish energy provider Vattenfall to explore how the EX60 and other Volvo EVs can help stabilize and balance the grid.\n\nKrishnan sees the EX60 as a critical piece that was missing from Volvo’s EV strategy: a family SUV that’s more affordable than the automaker’s three-row, $80,000-plus EX90. “So it’s a very big addressable market for the car,” he said.\n\nThe EX60 will be built in Volvo’s Gothenburg factory, with production set to begin in the first half of 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T03:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T08:38:39.324244"}

The PreEvnt Issac does just that, and you wear it like a necklace.", "content": "The wearables industry has solved the relatively easy stuff: step counting, sleep tracking, fitness coaching. It has also solved more complex things like detecting atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea. While all of these biometrics are useful, the continuous tracking of blood sugar in a way that’s noninvasive (meaning it doesn’t involve needles) has eluded the makers of fitness tracking devices.\n\nDiabetics need to monitor their blood sugar constantly to make sure it doesn’t go too high and damage their organs. This is especially hard for elderly people and small children, since monitoring blood sugar usually requires a pinprick blood test or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which also reaches under the skin.\n\nCGMs have also become hugely popular among non-diabetics as the popularity of GLP-1s has skyrocketed. Eating like a diabetic—lots of protein and fiber, minimal sugar and carbs—is a great way to lose weight. Apple, among other companies, has spent years, and millions of dollars, trying to introduce a no-prick blood glucose monitor to the Apple Watch, but the feature hasn’t arrived yet.\n\nAll this is to explain why I could scarcely believe that the PreEvnt Isaac was real when I saw it here at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. The Isaac is a small device, about the size of a quarter. Instead of tracking blood glucose optically through the skin, it measures volatile organic compounds in your breath to detect biomarkers like acetone that can be correlated with rising blood glucose levels.\n\nYou might not be able to wear it in a smart ring or watch, but a small device that you can wear around your neck or keep in your bag without having to retreat to the bathroom to prick your skin is a huge step up in quality of life for many, many people.\n\nUpcoming FDA Authorization\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Isaac is named after the inventor’s grandson, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 2 years old. A 2-year-old doesn’t want to get pricked constantly. Bud Wilcox realized that “acetone breath”—that sweet, fruity breath that is a common diabetic symptom—could be used to check for blood sugar events.\n\nPreEvnt and Wilcox showcased the concept at CES 2025 (it didn’t seem real then, either). Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials at Indiana University. The study is comparing Isaac’s performance with monitoring blood sugar levels as compared to traditional blood sugar monitoring, starting with adolescents with type 1 diabetes and then expanding to adults with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe trials are being conducted with an eye toward regulatory review by the US Food and Drug Administration in the upcoming year.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T10:38:10.099549"}

Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she’d later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist’s free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company.\n\n“There’s so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose Instagram account is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site’s free section; on the day we speak, she’s wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I’m ride or die.”\n\nKoester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It’s a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn’t have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like The Rehearsal on HBO and Amazon Freevee’s Jury Duty. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn’t use algorithms to track users’ moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn’t offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It’s a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest internet.\n\n“The real freaks come out on Craigslist,” says Koester. “There's a purity to it.” Even still, the site is a little tamer than it used to be: Craigslist shut down its “casual encounters” ads and took its personals section offline in 2018, after Congress passed legislation that would’ve put the company on the hook for listings from potential sex traffickers. The “missed connections” section, however, remains active.\n\nThe site is what Jessa Lingel, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has called the “ungentrified” internet. If that’s the case, then online gentrification has only accelerated in recent years, thanks in part to the proliferation of AI. Even Wikipedia and Reddit, visually basic sites created in the early aughts and with an emphasis similar to Craigslist’s on fostering communities, have both incorporated their own versions of AI tools.\n\nSome might argue that Craigslist, by contrast, is outdated; an article published in this magazine more than 15 years ago called it “underdeveloped” and “unpredictable.” But to the site’s most devoted adherents, that’s precisely its appeal.\n\n“ I think Craigslist is having a revival,” says Kat Toledo, an actor and comedian who regularly uses the site to hire cohosts for her LA-based stand-up show, Besitos. “When something is structured so simply and really does serve the community, and it doesn't ask for much? That’s what survives.”\n\nToledo started using Craigslist in the 2000s and never stopped. Over the years, she has turned to the site to find romance, housing, and even her current job as an assistant to a forensic psychologist. She’s worked there full-time for nearly two years, defying Craigslist’s reputation as a supplier of potentially sketchy one-off gigs. The stigma of the website, sometimes synonymous with scammers and, in more than one instance, murderers, can be hard to shake. “If I'm not doing a good job,” Toledo says she jokes to her employer, “just remember you found me on Craigslist.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T10:38:10.330877"}

According to a 2023 survey from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 51 percent of Americans are in some way “prepared for a disaster.” This helps explain why the prepping industry’s market cap is forecast to be nearly $300 billion by the end of the decade. Two of the firms competing for market share have nearly identical names and offer the same basic slate of products: power generators, dehydrated food, and water filtration. There’s Stapleton’s employer, 4Patriots, and its rival, My Patriot Supply. While exact revenue figures are difficult to pin down, officials at My Patriot Supply tell me that, before the pandemic, they rented part of a 45,000-square-foot space; today, the company built and fully utilizes a 428,000-square-foot warehouse not far from Stapleton’s home.\n\nThese two firms are aggressively jockeying to be the industry’s true patriot prepping company, with one official from My Patriot Supply claiming that 4Patriots is their “archnemesis.” My Patriot Supply is particularly bellicose, deeming the other company and its competitors “fake patriots”in a video. Meanwhile, both firms have notched their share of consumer complaints with government and business watchdogs over the years. 4Patriots customers have alleged that the company produces faulty water filters, defective generators, and dubious food. One person said their order was rife with roaches, while another claimed the company's Aztec Chili with Mango made them “can’t leave the bathroom sick” for a week. (According to the Better Business Bureau website, someone associated with 4Patriots replied to this alleged complaint a day later, adding, \"I'm so sorry that you had many issues after consuming the survival food kits.”) In 2016, the company voluntarily recalled a couple thousand generators due to an unforeseen fire hazard, and consumer complaints allege their generators continue to suffer from potentially dangerous electrical defects. (After putting 4Patriots’ 1,800-watt solar generator through lab testing, Consumer Reports rated it 46 out of 100.) Certainly, recalls and bad reviews are part and parcel of many businesses today, though an explicit part of the pitch from 4Patriots and its competitors is the rock-hard reliability of their goods when disaster strikes.\n\nIn a comment to WIRED, a 4Patriots official said the company shipped over 5 million products to consumers over the past three years and that it places “product quality and customer safety above all else.” He declined to detail the company’s return or refund rates, asserting that to equate those numbers with “product failure or customer dissatisfaction would be inaccurate.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T11:30:21.528915"}

I've seen the RAM kits selling for thousands of dollars. I've heard the statements from laptop suppliers and part manufacturers warning investors about what's coming. You probably have too. The memory chip shortage is already dire for companies and for individuals who build their own PCs. But don't think because you only use a laptop and a phone you're going to get out of this so easy.\n\nWhile the situation remains grim, I met two companies who have engineered ways out.

Photograph: Luke Larsen\n\n“We're waiting for the AI bubble to pop,” a spokesperson from a small PC manufacturer who wished to remain anonymous told me when asked about how they were handling the memory shortage.\n\nNone of the big laptop manufacturers or PC builders would say something quite that direct, but actions speak louder than words. While happily selling “AI PCs,” Lenovo, Dell, Asus, and HP have all stated that they'll be doing everything in their power to secure their supply of DRAM for the foreseeable future.\n\n“I’ve been at this a long time. This is the worst shortage I’ve ever seen.” Dell COO Jeff Clarke\n\nDRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is the kind of memory used in laptops and phones, and it’s what the three main memory manufacturers are now turning their backs on in favor of high-bandwidth memory for AI data centers. Lack of memory is the main reason you can’t run ChatGPT on your PC and have to outsource every prompt to the cloud.\n\nI spoke to Dell COO Jeff Clarke in December about what his company was doing to remedy the situation. “Our focus has been to secure the supply. That has always been the number one rule of our supply chain—to never run out of parts. We’ve been at this for a while. This just didn’t show up. So we’ve been out there for a while securing our supply.”\n\nIt’s a sentiment similar to what competitors like HP and Asus have told shareholders. But hoarding memory will only have two effects: It will raise prices even more or further tighten supply. Rumors of higher prices on electronics have begun to flood the internet. On the last day of 2025, Asus went first, officially announcing that it would be raising prices and tweaking configuration options on existing products.

The big three — Sony, Samsung, and LG — have been on top for a while. Pioneer and Panasonic were up there with plasma TVs, and Panasonic is getting back in the game in the States. Hisense, TCL, and Vizio battled it out as midrange tiers for years before Vizio pivoted from hardware profits to an ad-centric model under Walmart, leaving the other two to one-up each other by offering the most bang for the buck.\n\nBut over the past couple years, both TCL and Hisense have made impressive strides in performance, bringing them closer and closer to Sony, Samsung, and LG. And it’s not just that they made incremental improvements; both companies have been innovating and leading with technology. Hisense was the first company to debut an RGB LED TV last year (other companies were developing the technology, but Hisense showed it first). And this year TCL’s X11L leads the way as the first TV with reformulated quantum dots and a new color filter.\n\nThere are still things done by the big three that set them apart a little. Sony, for instance, has for years had extraordinary processing that other companies haven’t yet reached, and LG’s OLEDs have contrast that mini LED can’t compete against. But Hisense and TCL have put themselves firmly into the conversation. When TCL released the QM9K last year, it was a pretty clear statement that they’re ready to fight with the big boys.\n\nThen there’s the art TV category. What once exclusively belonged to Samsung and really set their brand identity apart has now grown to include models from nearly every manufacturer. This CES saw announcements from Amazon with its new Ember Artline TV and for LG’s Gallery TV. All of the TVs use similar edge-lit technology, have magnetic frames to make them look like a picture frame, include some form of art store (either with or without a subscription), and hang flush to the wall. While there are minor differences among them — brightness, matte screen effectiveness, and connectivity, for example — the experience from one to the next is remarkably similar. A category that once had a singular option is now saturated with them without a wide margin of differentiation.\n\nThere’s also LG’s Wallpaper OLED TV, which LG brought back this CES and could be lumped into the art TV discussion. But while it has an extremely slim profile that lays flush against the wall, includes art store support, and uses a wireless connection to eliminate wires (except for power), it has more in common with its sibling the G6 than any of the art TVs.\n\nEven as the gap in performance across technologies continues to shrink, and TVs from all the manufacturers get closer to parity, the challenge for TCL and Hisense shifts from creating incredible, competitive products to altering perception. Both companies have long been in that second tier. And even as their market share of sales increases, it seems like the public perception is that they’re still midrange TV manufactures as opposed to top tier.\n\nSome of that likely has to do with Hisense and TCL’s pricing, which is generally lower than LG, Samsung, and Sony. We still need to wait and see if that continues to be true with all of the new models announced at CES, but if it is, and the level of performance is comparable across brands, the big three will have to respond by bringing their pricing down or risk losing sales. The next step forward for TCL and Hisense will be breaking that second-tier public persona down and rebuilding as innovators.\n\nIs 2026 the year that happens? Very well could be.

And even if you’re not directly in Trump’s crosshairs, people around the world will likely have to grapple with the political and environmental ripple effects of whatever global game of chicken his administration plays next.\n\n“We’re entering this really uncertain, scary moment”\n\n“We’re entering this really uncertain, scary moment where this aggressive, toxic way of doing business is being put on the table,” says Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub.\n\nAbreu, who is half Venezuelan and lives in Canada, first heard news about the US attack on Caracas from her family. “There’s a lot of uncertainty and fear and mixed feelings, I would say, on the ground in Venezuela … as many Venezuelans have been protesting against [the Maduro] regime for years and want a change in Venezuelan government, but want that change to come from the Venezuelan people,” she says.\n\nVery soon after her family reached out, Abreu heard about the attack from worried colleagues in the climate movement who were “alarmed by the fact that this was being done in large part in the name of the interests of expanding United States oil and gas production.”\n\nVenezuela holds the world’s largest oil reserves, but only produces around 1 percent of global crude oil supply. This is because of years of neglect and mismanagement since the 1970s, when the country nationalized its oil industry. Now, Trump says, “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies … go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken [oil] infrastructure.”\n\nSecretary of Energy Chris Wright said Wednesday that the federal government is in talks with American companies to ramp up oil production in Venezuela, and that the US plans to control future oil sales in the country. The US has also seized two tankers believed to have carried or attempted to carry Venezuelan oil. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have said that Venezuela will turn over 30 to 50 million barrels of oil, which the US plans to sell at market price.\n\nTo be sure, there’s a lot of uncertainty around whether American companies will want to take their chances investing in a resurgence of Venezuelan oil production with so much instability still in the country. The US is already the world’s biggest oil producer, with more than 20 million barrels each day. Venezuela produces less than a million barrels of oil a day currently, and it would take more than $50 billion in investment over 15 years just to get that figure up to a steady 1.1 million barrels a day, according to research firm Rystad Energy.\n\nNevertheless after Maduro’s arrest, stock prices rose for fossil fuel companies including Chevron, the sole US oil major that’s been been able to keep operating in the country by brokering deals with the Venezuelan government after it expropriated assets from foreign oil businesses. “A lot of what drives the interest in places like Venezuela, places with large reserves, is the speculation market,” Abreu says. And regardless of whether US oil companies ultimately descend upon Venezuela, financial speculators who stand to benefit from the possibility of more oil production “are making money right now based on this invasion,” says Basav Sen, Climate Policy Project director at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nThere’s an argument to be made that a transition to renewable energy limits the vulnerability many countries in the Global South face from more wealthy and powerful governments eyeing their oil and gas. “These are inherently nonrenewable resources, which means that those who want to continue producing oil, gas, and coal are always going to need to be on the lookout for where the next source of this nonrenewable resource is coming from,” Abreu tells The Verge. Solar and wind power, which have become far more affordable over the decades, are now the fastest-growing sources of electricity around the world. “I really see the escalation of these kinds of conflicts being fueled by oil and gas interests as a response to and an attempt to arrest that momentum that we’re seeing in renewable energy,” Abreu says.\n\nThe Trump administration has framed the annexation of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, as a matter of US national security regardless of protests from its people and government. “Greenland is not for sale, and this has been clearly stated by both Greenlandic and Danish authorities,” Anne Merrild, who grew up in Greenland and is now head of the Department of Sustainability and Planning at Aalborg University, says in an email to The Verge. “In Greenland, the statements we hear in the media these days are often met with frustration and growing resentment, as they tend to overlook Greenland’s self-government and its ongoing efforts to define its own economic and societal development,” Merrild writes.\n\nExtracting Greenland’s resources is already entrenched in local political debate, she adds, and something that would need to be approached with the “meaningful involvement” of nearby communities to make sure they benefit from any new projects and to minimize any harm to the environment or fishing and hunting livelihoods.\n\nTrump’s posturing toward Greenland now, however, “sends a signal that the US is willing to take over places just to access resources, and that is naked 19th-century imperialism,” Sen says. “It is a very threatening signal to the rest of the world … Either you make the resources in your country available to us on our terms or you are subject to invasion.”\n\n“Venezuelan oil was the enabler”\n\nTrump’s former White House director of energy during his first administration, Landon Derentz, says in a January 4th Atlantic Council blog that “Venezuelan oil was the enabler,” while the real prize is the ability to exert US influence across the Western hemisphere.\n\nIt’s the revival of a philosophy that has underpinned centuries of calculated interventions in Latin America that have sowed political upheavals across the region in the name of installing governments friendly to US interests. “The United States is now practicing an enhanced version of the two-hundred-year-old Monroe Doctrine,” Derentz says in his blog. A new national security strategy document the Trump administration released late last year says plainly that the plan is to “assert and enforce a ‘Trump Corollary’ to the Monroe Doctrine.”\n\nWith that underlying power structure in place, history repeats itself — whether the conflict is over oil in Venezuela or minerals in Greenland. The rules of the game determine the outcome. Tackling climate change and transitioning to cleaner energy through joint efforts like the Paris accord, incidentally, has been a major test of global cooperation over the brute force of strongman politics. The US flip-flopping from one philosophy to another with Trump back in office is obviously tipping the scale.\n\n“I worry about the ways in which the US with these actions is kind of normalizing the idea that a country would just completely set aside the norms of multilateralism, of lawful interactions between states in the international arena,” Abreu says. “Would just throw those norms aside in the name of pursuing its oil and gas interests, even if that ultimately isn’t what is served.” On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw the US from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and 65 other international organizations and treaties.\n\nEven if America throwing its weight around to get what it wants is nothing new, it’s suddenly taking a more brash turn than the US has dared in decades. The president is “deadly serious about getting back the oil that was stolen from us,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on January 3rd. “And deadly serious about reestablishing American deterrent and dominance in the Western hemisphere.”\n\nThe allegation of theft is a misleading oversimplification of the nationalization of the oil industry in Venezuela. It’s a talking point justifying the idea that what you think is yours — even if it’s right under your feet — is already mine because I said so.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T07:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T12:58:05.868263"}
{"title": "Creatine Supplements Are Everywhere. Do I Need Them? (2026)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-be-taking-creatine-supplements/", "summary": "It's the most studied supplement in sports medicine, but it's not just for athletes anymore.", "content": "Creatine monohydrate is typically sold as a flavorless, white powder that you can mix into water or a shake. According to Amati, the standard dose is three to five grams per day. Some athletes may “load” with higher doses, but studies show this offers no long-term benefits and can put unnecessary stress on the kidneys.\n\nMuscle Growth and Exercise Performance\n\nCreatine is most useful for activities that demand short, intense effort: sprinting, weightlifting, and high-intensity interval training, to name a few. It’s far less relevant for endurance sports like marathons. Some evidence suggests creatine also increases muscle glycogen storage, which could help with recovery and energy replenishment between sessions.\n\nCreatine doesn’t directly build muscle, but paired with resistance training and adequate nutrition, it can help preserve muscle strength and lean body mass. It’s particularly important if you’re recovering from an injury, or as you age, when sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) becomes a risk, as it activates specialized stem cells known as satellite cells. Zimmerman points out that women, especially in perimenopause and menopause, may see health benefits. “As women get older—starting in our forties—we lose body mass 1 to 2 percent a year, and that can affect bone health later on in life,” says Zimmermann. “Creatine [supplements] support keeping and building lean muscle mass.”\n\nZimmermann adds, “Women tend to have lower muscle mass than men, just naturally, so I think women may actually respond better to supplementation, because they’re at baseline.”\n\nCreatine and Brain Health\n\nWhile the effects of creatine supplementation on athletic performance are well-documented, its effects on mental performance are still emerging. Early findings are promising. Studies suggest it may reduce mental fatigue, especially during high-stress situations, such as sleep deprivation or exhaustive exercise. It may also improve certain aspects of memory, particularly in groups with lower baseline creatine levels, such as vegetarians and older adults.\n\nSome preliminary research even suggests it could help with symptoms of depression by supporting brain energy and boosting the production of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. That’s particularly relevant for women experiencing perimenopause and menopause, says Zimmerman. “Estrogen shifts affect brain health, our mood, brain fog, and being able to think clearly.”\n\nIs Creatine Safe?\n\nFor most healthy adults, creatine is a safe and well-tolerated supplement for months or even years of use. Short-term and long-term clinical trials have found no significant health risks. The main side effects are minor: weight gain from temporary water retention in the first week of supplementation, bloating, and mild gastric discomfort, usually from oversize doses.\n\nHowever, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\nPeople with kidney disease should avoid creatine unless cleared by a health care professional.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against creatine use in people under 18 due to limited research on its long-term effects in children and young adults.\n\ndue to limited research on its long-term effects in children and young adults. The Food and Drug Adminstration doesn’t regulate dietary supplements for label accuracy or purity. Choose a reputable brand with third-party testing to ensure you’re getting a product that is what it says it is. Also, skip the creatine gummies.\n\nOur Favorite Creatine Supplements\n\nBest Overall\n\nThorne offers a colorless, odorless, and, most importantly, flavorless powder that dissolves into protein shakes, smoothies, or just water. While they do offer flavors like strawberry and pineapple-orange, I always choose an unflavored version when available, so that I'm not consuming unnecessary additives. Each small scoop delivers a solid five grams of creatine. Thorne also sells stick-pack single servings for on-the-go convenience.\n\nThorne is one of the wellness brands I trust the most because its dietary supplements all undergo four rounds of testing. First, they screen raw materials for contaminants. During the manufacturing process, they check the supplement bottles and labels for defects. They test the finished products for purity and potency, ensuring no microbiological contamination has occurred. Lastly, they perform stability testing to confirm its label claims through the expiration date.\n\nBest Value\n\nThis creatine powder is tasteless, odorless, and comes with a nice 5-gram scoop that allows you to easily measure how much you've put in your drink. It's easy to store, gives you about 100 5-gram servings, and comes in a nondescript bottle that won't make you feel like you're some fitness influencer. I have enjoyed it in coffee, tea, and just plain water, though I'd recommend sticking to only 5 grams per drink; it can get a bit chalky if you try to do more in 8 oz of water. —Parker Hall\n\nBest Flavors\n\nSticking to a daily regimen of any kind is difficult for me, but this creatine is truly so delicious that I look forward to drinking it every day. I tried the pink lemonade flavor, which is tart and sweet. There are other fruity flavors available, like Peach and Strawberry Açai, as well as an unflavored version. Each serving contains 5 grams of creatine, plus a gram each of collagen and BCAAs. I don’t particularly care about the collagen since the science around it is minimal, but BCAAs can help build muscle as well as ease muscle soreness.\n\nWhile Peach Perfect is marketed towards building your booty, creatine can help build muscle everywhere. I definitely noticed a difference while lifting weights during the week when I ran out of this powder (before I set up a subscription on Amazon). The supplement dissolves quickly and has a pleasant, non-gritty texture. I’ve even mixed it in my daily dose of greens. The supplement undergoes third-party testing via Eurofins to check for pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants. —Louryn Strampe\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Remember LED, QLED, Mini LED, Micro LED, OLED, QD OLED? Meet RGB LED!\n\nSadly, all these acronyms do actually mean something, and this year's popular newcomer—RGB LED—implies shockingly accurate colors. Hiding behind upcoming panels from Hisense, Sony, Samsung, and LG announced at CES 2026, RGB LED (unhelpfully also called Micro RGB or RGB Mini LED) is the hot panel technology to talk about this year. I just wish they'd call it “Supercolor,” or something folks could actually remember.\n\nWhat Is RGB LED?\n\nCourtesy of Samsung\n\nModern TVs compete on the qualities of their backlighting and their color representation. Edge-lit LED TVs of the past were thin, but their darkest tones tended toward the gray instead of the truly black.\n\nThis has been fixed in recent years by various technologies. Quantum dots help colors appear better on the latest LED TVs (often called QLED). Tech like multi-zone LED (and more recently mini-LED) backlighting uses thousands of tiny white LEDs illuminate specific sections of the screen from behind. OLED (\"organic LED\") TVs, introduced by LG a little over a decade ago, do something similar but more accurately, with each pixel acting as its own backlight.\n\nNew RGB LEDs TVs bring color to the previously shade-based backlighting world of LED TVs, with the illumination arrays behind the screen gaining the ability to backlight the panel in front of them with red, green, or blue. This means gorgeous color accuracy, along with a theoretical overall brightness that can outcompete OLED TVs.\n\nA historic criticism of OLEDs has been that they just aren't bright enough for well-lit rooms, and that the individual pixels can burn into the display with prolonged exposure to the same content. Frankly, our TV reviews team has seen those issues largely evaporate over the past few generations of OLED panels (and recent Quantum Dot OLEDs), all with truly eye-burning brightness.\n\nWhat RGB LEDs do promise is scarily accurate colors in addition to said extreme brightness. They have been able to display 100 percent of the BT.2020 color scale, which is something prior-generation LED TVs were simply not capable of. This means that, for folks watching the (admittedly) limited amount of content, typically animated, that uses this expanded color palette—shout out to contributor Caleb Denison of CalebRated for his recommendation of Inside Out 2 as a test disc—you should be able to see shades that were previously impossible to see.\n\nEarly Arrivals\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is the first meaningful generation of RGB LED TVs that will be available to consumers, with the aforementioned top players in the space all having announced some version of RGB LED screen or another for release in 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T12:58:06.559108"}

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.\n\nGoogle is announcing a new AI Inbox view for Gmail that, instead of presenting your emails in a traditional list, uses AI to offer personalized to-dos and summaries of topics you might want to follow from your emails.\n\nIt’s a potentially huge shift in how you might navigate your Gmail, especially if you have a lot to sort through or if you (like me) already use your inbox as a to-do list. In a demo video, AI Inbox suggests tasks like rescheduling a dentist appointment, replying to a coach, and paying a sports tournament fee, and also summarizes topics to catch up on, like a team’s soccer season and a family gathering.\n\nGoogle is initially rolling AI Inbox out to “trusted testers” in the US using browsers, and it will be available first for consumer Gmail accounts — you can’t use it with Workspace accounts yet. There’s also not yet a way to mark if you have completed one of the suggested items — it’s something Google is working on, according to the company’s VP of product for Gmail, Blake Barnes — meaning that Gmail won’t yet know if, for example, you call somebody based on Gmail’s recommended action, rather than emailing them.\n\nBarnes also says there’s no limit to the number of to-dos Gmail might suggest. While AI Inbox tries to prioritize what’s important to you based on signals like who you email and what things you respond to the quickest, too many to-dos could just perpetuate inbox overwhelm but with a new design.\n\nStill, given how much of our lives flows through our inboxes, if AI Inbox is even somewhat successful at making timely recommendations and summarizing important emails, the feature could be quite useful.\n\nAll consumer Gmail users are also getting suggested replies with personalization, AI overviews for thread summaries, and Google’s Help Me Write tool — all features Google has previously included with paid plans — at no extra cost. Subscribers to Google One AI Pro ($19.99 per month) and Ultra ($249.99 per month) plans in the US will be getting a Grammarly-like proofread feature, as well as AI overviews in search results, both available in browsers. (Google’s example for the latter is “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?”)\n\nIf you don’t want to use AI features in Gmail, you can turn them off (though that disables other smart features, like spell checking).

On Thursday, the company announced a new “AI Inbox” tab, currently in a beta testing phase, that reads every message in a user’s Gmail and suggests a list of to-dos and key topics, based on what it summarizes.\n\nIn Google’s example of what this AI Inbox could look like in Gmail, the new tab takes context from a user’s messages and suggests they reschedule their dentist appointment, reply to a request from their child’s sports coach, and pay an upcoming fee before the deadline. Also under the AI Inbox tab is a list of important topics worth browsing, nestled beneath the action items at the top. Each suggested to-do and topic links back to the original email for more context and for verification.\n\nCourtesy of Google\n\nDespite the continued spread of generative AI features, the underlying reliability of these tools remains iffy. Back in 2023, when Google’s chatbot was still called “Bard,” I tested the company’s nascent Gmail extension that tried to summarize my messages and search through the inbox for insights. At the time, this extension was a complete bust, with a bevy of incorrect responses.\n\nSince then, Google has worked to better its base AI model, called Gemini, and integrate those improvements into its suite of existing software services, including Gmail as well as Search. Despite the company's advances in AI, current Gmail users are still shown a disclaimer stating that Gemini “can make mistakes” when attempting to search an inbox and answer questions.\n\nCourtesy of Google\n\nFor users who are concerned about their privacy, the information Google gleans by skimming through inboxes will not be used to improve the company's foundational AI models. “We didn’t just bolt AI onto Gmail,” says Blake Barnes, who leads the project for Google. “We built a secure privacy architecture, specifically for this moment.” He emphasizes that users can turn off Gmail’s new AI tools if they don’t want them.\n\nAt the same time Google announced its AI Inbox, the company made free for all Gmail users multiple Gemini features that were previously available only to paying subscribers. This includes the Help Me Write tool, which generates emails from a user prompt, as well as AI Overviews for email threads, which essentially posts a TL;DR summary at the top of long message threads.\n\nCourtesy of Google\n\nSubscribers to Google's Ultra and Pro plans, which start at $20 a month, get two additional new features in their Gmail inbox.

Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup.\n\nRetailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand’s website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts.\n\nSince emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview.\n\nTraffic flowing through Spangle’s platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures.\n\nAt the core of Spangle’s approach is a simple idea: instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle’s AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment.\n\nImage Credits:Spangle\n\nKuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\n“We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer’s catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically.\n\nSpangle’s software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer’s vice president of performance marketing.\n\nBefore starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the one-click checkout company Bolt and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th.\n\nKuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle’s focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce.\n\nSpangle’s approach also aligns with a shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor.\n\nKuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves.\n\nCurrently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams.\n\nWith the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T13:47:58.606681"}

This is closer to the AI Overview experience to which you are accustomed in Google’s web search. You can enter a natural language search, and the robot churns through your messages to generate a response.\n\nGmail AI Overview Gmail AI Overview\n\nIn the example above, the user looks up a past plumbing quote. Traditionally, Gmail would show emails that are likely matches for your search. With AI Overview, you instead get a nicely formatted AI answer that includes all the relevant information and cites the email. That sounds all well and good, assuming it works. AI Overviews in search is notoriously inaccurate when summarizing search results, but grounding it in your email could make it less likely to screw up. Maybe.\n\nAI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also begin seeing a new proofreading tool in Gmail.

Google says AI Proofreading can make more nuanced changes than standard spellchecking features thanks to the company’s largest and most powerful Gemini 3 models.\n\nGmail AI Inbox Gmail AI Inbox\n\nLastly, Google is previewing a new version of its iconic inbox—no, not that Inbox. The AI Inbox will roll out to a group of “trusted testers” before making its way to more users. The AI Inbox looks at your unread mail and creates an interactive list with “Priorities” at the top.

The fourth Developer Direct will provide a closer look at two of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games this year, Forza Horizon 6 and Fable, as well as a first in-depth look at Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak.\n\nPlayground Games will debut the first gameplay of Forza Horizon 6 during the Developer Direct show, after first revealing that the next instalment in the Forza Horizon franchise is set in Japan. Forza Horizon 6 players will be able to experience the neon lights and buildings of Tokyo City, as well as an open world set in various other parts of Japan.\n\nWe’ve been waiting to hear more about Playground Games’ other big Xbox title, Fable, after Microsoft delayed its release to 2026. Fable appears to be on track for a release this year, which also marks 25 years of Xbox. “Devs from the Playground team will unveil the magic and mischief that awaits players in this fresh new beginning for the franchise, including a first look at some stunning new gameplay,” says Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire editor-in-chief.\n\nGame Freak, known for its Pokémon RPG games, will also show off parts of its new Beast of Reincarnation action RPG. It’s launching at some point in 2026 on Xbox Series S / X, PS5, and PC, and in the game you’ll play as Emma, who will be accompanied by a canine friend.\n\nThis year’s Xbox Developer Direct will take place at 1PM ET / 10PM PT / 6PM UK on January 22nd and will be streamed live on on Twitch and YouTube.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T09:14:33-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T14:31:29.428368"}

While there wasn’t as much of the first as I had hoped, there sure was a lot of the latter. TV manufacturers delivered enormous displays with additional subpixels, intriguing advancements on existing technologies, and the return of a stylish and slim favorite.\n\nLG’s Wallpaper TV made a return at CES. Photo by John Higgins / The Verge\n\nFirst launched back in 2017, LG’s Wallpaper TV redefined what a slim TV could be. After a few years away, the Wallpaper TV has returned with the W6. This new model is only 9 millimeters thick, has carved linear patterns around its perimeter for reinforced rigidity that looks stylish, and hangs flush against the wall. The TV uses the wireless Zero Connect Box 2.0, so you don’t have a bunch of cables from your sources to the TV (there is a thin power cable at the bottom left of the TV, though). The box is 35 percent smaller than its previous iteration and supports 4K signals up to 165Hz on all its HDMI ports, making it the first TV capable of that.\n\nThe W6 uses LG’s Primary RGB Tandem 2.0 panel and Hyper Radiant Color Technology. It should have a 20 percent increase in brightness over the G5, which I measured at over 2,400 nits. The W6 also has 12-bit color depth processing, which gives it more headroom when receiving the 10-bit signal sent from sources, causing fewer artifacts.\n\nThe TCL X11L introduces new quantum dots and an updated color filter. Photo by John Higgins / The Verge\n\nThe main TV focus of the show for TCL was on its X11L SQD-Mini LED (so much so, that there weren’t any details revealed about its other TV lines). The TV uses blue LEDs — and not the RGB LEDs that most manufacturers were showing at CES — and TCL says it’s capable of an incredible 10,000 nits of brightness, has up to 20,000 dimming zones, and covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color gamut.\n\nThis is because of two advancements TCL has made. The X11L is the only TV that uses reformulated quantum dots and an improved color filter developed by TCL CSOT (the company’s panel manufacturing division). Color on the TV looks spectacular, and thanks to all those dimming zones (and some great processing), the TV has excellent blooming control. This new innovation doesn’t come cheap, as the smallest size of 75 inches starts at $6,999.99, but it’s still a big step for mini LED.\n\nThe Samsung R95H was an imposing greeter at First Look. Photo by John Higgins / The Verge\n\nBack in August of 2025, Samsung officially launched its first Micro RGB TV, and in the days leading up to CES announced new sizes down to 55 inches would be coming in 2026. But when the doors opened at Samsung’s First Look event at CES, it was obvious they planned to impress. Attendees were greeted by the 130-inch R95H Micro RGB TV — Samsung’s largest micro RGB display.\n\nThe TV has Samsung’s Timeless Frame, which makes it look like the TV is suspended in air within the metal frame. The R95H is capable of 100 percent of BT.2020, has a glare-free screen, and supports HDR10+ Advanced. But while it’s impressive, the TV is only a prototype, so don’t go making space in your living room.\n\nHisense 116-inch UXS\n\nNot to be outdone by the competition, Hisense went and added a new LED color. Image: Hisense\n\nThe company that started the whole RGB LED trend that now every manufacturer is a part of, with the Hisense UX, has now upgraded it with the new 116-inch UXS. But what’s fascinating is that it’s no longer just an RGB LED TV. It’s now an RGCB LED TV, as Hisense has added a cyan LED to the backlight of the UXS.\n\nHisense says there are a couple benefits to adding the cyan LED. First, it helps smooth the transition between blue and green, which can be prone to color crosstalk, affecting the color purity. Plus, it also helps reduce the blue light output in the range that can cause eyestrain and fatigue, as well as affect your circadian rhythms. The extra cyan LED also bumps up the BT.2020 coverage of the UXS to 110 percent.\n\nLG G6 OLED\n\nThe LG G6 is poised to be a top contender for the best TV of the year. Photo by John Higgins / The Verge\n\nLG’s flagship G6 has a lot of similarities with the W6 Wallpaper TV mentioned earlier. It also uses the Primary RGB Tandem panel with Hyper Radiant Color Technology which should be 20 percent brighter than last year’s G5. LG has said that the G6 will have deeper blacks than before, and it has a reflection free technology with less than 0.5 perfect reflectance to keep those blacks nice and inky, no matter the lighting condition.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T09:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T14:31:29.602524"}

The company is also offering a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that fits to any device.\n\nAt CES, TechCrunch chatted with Clicks chief marketing officer and co-founder, Jeff Gadway, and went hands-on with the latest handmade prototype of the forthcoming smartphone.\n\nThe device, which offers a BlackBerry-like keyboard and messaging-focused touchscreen, runs Android 16 under the hood. That means the Communicator can run any Android app, but it partnered with the minimalist launcher, Niagara Launcher, to display your favorite apps on the homescreen. Other apps are within easy reach via a scrollable list.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nReception for the new devices has been better than expected, Gadway told TechCrunch. Although he declined to share sales numbers, he did say that over the past week the company was making a sale every 6.5 seconds between both devices.\n\nWhile the prototype we tried is not a working phone, it’s the same size and weight as the device that’s preparing to ship later this year, giving an initial feel for what it would be like to use the Communicator.\n\nThe interchangeable back covers can pop off so you can change the phone’s design whenever inspiration strikes. While not present on the prototype, the cover will have a small notch at the top and then a little finger pick at the bottom.\n\nUnderneath the back is where your nano-SIM card will go. Onboard storage lands at 256 gigabytes, with expandable microSD storage of up to 2 terabytes of data. The device will also sport a 4000mAh silicon-carbon battery and is currently weighing in around 170 grams (or 6 oz).\n\nIn our hands-on test, the phone feels good to hold. The device is not too heavy but not too light, and easy to grip.\n\nThe final form was settled on after dozens of 3D printed shapes, Gadway notes. The winning design for the phone includes a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.\n\nThe device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and the chin of the device is curved up, which creates a recessed area to protect the keys when you place it face down. (You will want to place the phone face down if you’re trying to avoid distractions!)\n\nThat’s also where the device’s light-up side button can help. Called the “Signal Light,” the button can be configured to glow with different colors or patterns when you’ve received messages from certain people, groups, or apps. That way, you can be sure to respond if it’s your boss or the kids contacting you, but you can ignore it when it’s a less important notification.\n\nImage Credits:Clicks\n\nThe tactile, physical keys feel good, though the prototype’s version may actually be a little less “clicky” than the final product. (There’s a debate between whether the keys should have 110 grams of pressure or more like 120 or 130 grams, and feedback so far is that the latter figures are winning.)\n\nWith less pressure, the keys feel softer, which could be more accessible for those who haven’t used a BlackBerry before. But people who type fast tend to prefer more clicky keys because there’s more feedback.\n\n“This is the stuff that Michael Fisher and myself and Kevin Michaluk fight over all the time,” said Gadway, referring to his co-founders. “We’re fighting over grams.”\n\nThe keys and the screen are also at the same vertical height, so you can seamlessly move from the keyboard to the touchscreen.\n\nImage Credits:Clicks\n\nThe phone’s front fixed-focus, hole-punch camera can capture 24-megapixel imagery. The back camera, which features optical image stabilization and electronic image stabilization for video, can capture 50-megapixel images.\n\nThe phone will also feature a MediaTek 4-nanometer, 5G IoT processor, with 8 gigabytes of RAM.\n\nThe Communicator’s display will be a 4.03-inch AMOLED display at 1,080 x 1,200 resolution. Wired charging is up to 18 watts, and wireless charging is up to 15 watts. The device is also Qi compatible and Android Strongbox-ready, which will appeal to security-minded customers.\n\nThe phone has other standard features too, like GPS, NFC, and will offer five years of security updates and Android updates through Android 20.\n\nThe device is expected to ship in the second half of 2026.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:22:48 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T14:31:29.853654"}

However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”\n\nThis new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.\n\nGoogle says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.\n\nAs for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nFor instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It’ll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It’s essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.\n\nBy rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.\n\nProofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.\n\nWhile these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail’s “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users. These features were previously only available to paying subscribers.\n\nHelp Me Write can help you compose an email from a single prompt, while AI Overviews for threaded emails provide summaries of longer email threads with multiple replies.

First, as mirrors became larger and larger to see deeper into the universe, their costs grew exponentially. And then, with the advent of spaceflight, the expense of space-based telescopes expanded even further.\n\nBut now the tide may be turning again.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, announced a major investment in not just one telescope project, but four. Each of these new telescopes brings a novel capability online; however, the most intriguing new instrument is a space-based telescope named Lazuli. This spacecraft, if successfully launched and deployed, would offer astronomers a more capable and modern version of the Hubble Space Telescope, which is now three decades old.\n\nA billionaire with a keen interest in science and technology, Schmidt and his wife did not disclose the size of his investment in the four telescopes, which collectively will be known as the Schmidt Observatory System. However, it likely is worth half a billion dollars, at a minimum.\n\n“For 20 years, Eric and I have pursued philanthropy to seek new frontiers, whether in the deep sea or in the profound connections that link people and our planet, committing our resources to novel research that reaches beyond what might be funded by governments or the private sector,” Wendy Schmidt said in a statement to Ars. “With the Schmidt Observatory System, we’re enabling multiple approaches to understanding the vast universe where we find ourselves stewards of a living planet.”\n\nEssentially the Schmidts have taken innovative telescope concepts that scientists have proposed for government funding and will provide the money needed to build them.

Apple promised a “post-PC” era with the iPad in 2010 and failed to deliver one. Smartphones even overtook laptops as the most popular device to connect to the internet a decade ago, but millions of people still kept buying PCs every year. But this PC resiliency is going to be tested even further this year.\n\nRAM and NAND / SSD prices have surged in recent months due to shortages created by AI data center demand. Some stores have had to sell memory like it’s lobster, prebuilt PC costs have risen, and some assemblers are even selling PCs without RAM.\n\nNow, we’re about to see how the shortage hits regular laptops and PCs from the likes of Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, and Acer. TrendForce predicts that memory prices are projected to “rise sharply again in the first quarter of 2026.” More price rises will only put further pressure on laptop and PC pricing, and we’re seeing early signs that PC makers are adjusting prices at CES this week.\n\nAsus announced to its channel partners this week that it’s implementing price hikes across its products as a result of the memory market conditions. Dell also adjusted the launch pricing of its XPS 14 and XPS 16 just hours before they were announced this week, in a sign that laptop pricing is going to become increasingly fluid. Lenovo has been stockpiling PC memory to try and weather the storm throughout 2026, and HP has warned it will have to increase prices and offer lower RAM configurations later this year. Like Lenovo, HP also has a stockpile of memory, but it expects the continued rise in costs will begin eating into PC product margins by May.\n\nThere’s no quick fix for PC makers, either. Offering less RAM on laptops will be difficult for manufacturers, particularly below the 8GB threshold. Windows 11 has a minimum RAM requirement of 4GB, but it doesn’t run particularly well in those conditions. While TrendForce predicts some smartphones are likely to return to just 4GB this year, “for budget notebooks, DRAM cannot be reduced quickly due to processor pairing needs and operating system limitations.”\n\nThe timing of this memory shortage couldn’t be any worse for Microsoft and its PC partners. Windows 10 just hit end of life in October, and many businesses are in the process of migrating to Windows 11. That often involves a PC refresh cycle, and there were strong signs throughout 2025 that PC shipments were accelerating thanks to a refresh of the existing install base. That momentum could be derailed later this year once RAM stockpiles are depleted.\n\nTiming isn’t the only problem for the PC market, as the increased prices of RAM and SSDs could be permanent instead of a temporary supply constraint. “This is not just a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand, but a potentially permanent, strategic reallocation of the world’s silicon wafer capacity,” warns IDC. “For decades, the production of DRAM and NAND Flash for smartphones and PCs was the primary driver for production. Today, that dynamic has inverted.”\n\nThe demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon has pushed Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron to pivot toward building high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5 memory. “Every wafer allocated to an HBM stack for an Nvidia GPU is a wafer denied to the LPDDR5X module of a mid-range smartphone or the SSD of a consumer laptop,” says IDC.\n\nThis is going to have a big impact on the DIY market and PC gaming, too. “PC gaming is thriving at a time when overall consumer PC shipments have declined by 14 percent in the last five years… annual gaming PC shipments are up 50 percent,” said Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge last week.\n\nThe popularity of PC gaming has allowed smaller assemblers to offer custom prebuilt systems at competitive prices. These smaller builders can’t stockpile RAM or SSDs, and “will bear the greatest burden of the shortage,” warns IDC. “That in turn represents an opportunity for large OEMs to gain share from smaller assemblers in the gaming space by positioning prebuilt systems as offering higher value.”\n\nDemand for memory looks set to impact GPU prices too. Rumors have suggested that Nvidia could force GPU partners to adjust pricing to factor in increased memory costs. “The demand for memory in the market is at record levels, and this does mean supply will be tight,” admitted Ben Berraondo, director of global PR for Nvidia GeForce, in a briefing with The Verge last week. “There have been no major changes in how we manage memory with our customers. There are no major supply chain changes to GeForce,” says Berraondo.\n\nDespite a lack of major memory changes to GeForce, pricing is already starting to increase. Newegg has started listing a variety of RTX 5090 cards at well above $4,000. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find an RTX 5090 for under $3,000, after prices were close to the $1,999 retail price in September.\n\nBerraondo didn’t comment directly on the rumors of $5,000 pricing for the RTX 5090, but he did point to Nvidia’s Founders Edition model still being listed at $1,999 at Best Buy. That’s great, but it’s constantly out of stock so it’s not representative of the true retail pricing of the RTX 5090.\n\nIf the costs of building a gaming PC don’t stabilize in 2026, Microsoft will also feel increased pressure on its next-gen Xbox plans. Microsoft is aggressively pivoting toward PC for the future of Xbox consoles, with the handheld Xbox Ally devices just the beginning of its plans. Component costs could force the price of the next-gen Xbox even higher and also impact Sony’s plans with the PS6 and Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine.\n\nThe memory shortage also threatens to impact Microsoft’s AI PC push. Microsoft set a surprising minimum of 16GB of RAM for its Copilot Plus PCs, in order to handle local small language models. Qualcomm has been pushing to bring Windows on Arm (Copilot Plus PCs) down to the $600 price range, but that effort looks set to reverse due to memory costs.\n\nIt increasingly feels like we’re witnessing a battle over the future of the PC, where component prices and AI features are having a big impact on computing. If AI demand wins the battle then more traditional computing tasks will increasingly be performed in the cloud. That could force businesses to increasingly move to virtual machines instead of refreshing laptops and gamers to look at cloud streaming services instead of buying an expensive gaming PC.\n\nI don’t think this battle means the end of the PC anytime soon. It just feels like another step in Big Tech marching us toward an unproven AI future. I have faith the PC will survive and evolve and prove once again how important it truly is.\n\nThe pad\n\nI’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else.

Remote control features and grouping speakers will also continue to work, and users will still be able to set up and configure their SoundTouch speakers.\n\nNow that the smart speakers’ API is being open-sourced, users can also create their own compatible SoundTouch tools to help fill in any gaps left by the lack of cloud services. While it’s still disappointing that the speakers are losing official support, Bose’s approach at least lets people continue using their speakers, rather than bricking otherwise functional devices.\n\nThis move from Bose is particularly surprising because of how rare it is. Usually when products lose support for cloud services, they end up bricked, and occasionally users step in themselves to fix things. For instance, when Pebble originally shut down in 2016, users kept their watches functional by creating the Rebble Alliance, a community-run replacement for the watches’ cloud services, firmware, and app store.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T09:42:48-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T15:00:42.578851"}

Vanessa Larco of Premise VC thinks 2026 will be the year of the consumer.", "content": "Investment in consumer tech startups has been in a downturn since 2022, as a turbulent macroeconomic climate and rising inflation have made VCs skittish about consumer spending power. For the past couple of years, most AI investment has focused on winning over enterprise customers, who provide fat checks, multi-year contracts, and quick paths to scale.\n\nBut one VC sees the consumer sector gearing up for a comeback in 2026.\n\n“This is gonna be the year of the consumer,” said Vanessa Larco, partner at the venture firm Premise and a former partner at NEA, on this week’s episode of the Equity podcast.\n\nLarco says that even though enterprises have big budgets and a frantic desire to implement AI solutions, adoption often stalls because “they don’t know where to start,” Larco says.\n\n“The fun thing about consumer and prosumer…is that people already have in mind what they want to use it for,” Larco continued. “And so they purchase it, and if it meets the need, they just keep using it.”\n\nIn other words, adoption is quicker, and startups building AI products don’t have to guess whether they’ve actually achieved product-market fit or have just won a contract.\n\n“If you’re selling to consumers, you’ll know very quickly if it’s fitting a need or not, and you’ll know quickly whether you need to pivot or make some changes to your product or totally scrap it and start something totally different,” Larco said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nAnd in today’s anxiety-inducing economy, consumer tech products that manage to scale demonstrate an especially strong product-market fit.\n\nThere are early indications that consumer tech is having a moment. Late last year, OpenAI launched apps in ChatGPT, allowing users to shop with the Target app, scour the housing market with Zillow, book trips with Expedia, or make a Spotify playlist, all through the ChatGPT chatbot experience.\n\n“AI is gonna feel like concierge-like services, which will do everything for you that you have in mind,” Larco said. “The question is, which of it should be specialized, and which should be general purpose?”\n\nOr put differently, as OpenAI works to make ChatGPT the new operating system of the consumer internet, which legacy companies – like Tripadvisor or WebMD – will continue to exist in their own right, and which will get eaten by OpenAI?\n\nWhile Larco does think 2026 is going to be a “gangbuster” year for M&A, she’s interested in investing in startups that “OpenAI isn’t going to want to kill.”\n\n“OpenAI doesn’t manage real-world assets,” she said. “I don’t think they’ll build an Airbnb competitor because I don’t think they’re gonna want to manage homes…I don’t think they’re going to build any of these marketplaces that require real humans because they don’t want to manage the humans.”\n\nAside from which startups can fill the gaps, Larco is watching out for what happens if OpenAI “decides to pull an Apple or Android where they take a 30% cut of all the traffic they send you.”\n\n“Is Airbnb gonna want to play ball with that?” she asked.\n\nOverall, Larco predicts new monetization strategies and fresh business models will emerge from the evolved consumer experience online.\n\n‘Social has to change’\n\nWhile doomscrolling on Instagram about Trump’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Larco noticed something. She had come to the platform to get news on the escalating crisis, but instead she was overwhelmingly flooded with AI-generated Maduro slop.\n\nWhile deepfakes have been steadily becoming mainstream on social media, this was one of the first major news events where AI-generated slop muddied the waters of the truth.\n\n“At that point, I was like, if I’m just gonna be watching AI-generated videos and photos, I want it to be funny,” she said.\n\nLarco says she has been inundated with enough realistic-looking AI videos on social media that she just assumes it’s all AI at this point, and she’s not alone. If we all start to assume that nothing we see on Meta’s platforms or TikTok is real anymore, the question will be, where do you get the real stuff?\n\nLarco says others might fill in the gaps of where to find truthful, non-AI content as platforms like Reddit and Digg make moves to verify humanity. But for Meta? Maybe it just becomes an entertainment company, a platform for user-generated short films.\n\n“I think we should move on from getting your news from [Meta],” Larco said. “You are just getting funny videos from there. It’s not social media. It’s just gaming and entertainment media.”\n\n‘Some things are better with voice than a screen’\n\nMeta Ray-Ban display Image Credits:Meta / Meta\n\nWhen Meta acquired AI agent startup Manus last week, many saw it as an enterprise play. Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen.\n\nLarco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute.\n\n“Some things are better with voice than a screen,” she said. “And because voice sucked, we needed the screen as a crutch. But I would love to start separating out what things are really better on a screen and what things are just better with audio.”\n\nGetting answers to questions her kids ask about what the tallest building is? Definitely voice. Taking out her phone to type in the question now feels “archaic,” Larco said.\n\n“I think it’ll be really fun for designers because they finally get to pick and choose what form factor is better for what use cases,” she said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:46:16 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T15:00:42.882620"}

And they likely won’t be changing anytime soon.\n\nAny gaming enthusiast could probably easily name the top five: Fortnite, Roblox, Call of Duty, Minecraft, and Grand Theft Auto V. These aren’t just the most-played games of ’24 and ’25, but have hovered at or around the top of the most-played list for several years now. Though they vary wildly in genre and gameplay, they have a handful of shared characteristics that inform some of their success. All of them are established games, around for eight years or more. They all are multiplatform and have multiplayer capabilities, numerous gameplay modes, and are constantly updated with new content. With the exception of Call of Duty, all the games extensively feature user-generated content while Fortnite and Roblox are free to play.\n\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League — great idea, poor execution. Image: Rocksteady Games\n\nThe newest game of the bunch, Fortnite, has been around since 2017. It’s hard to ask a player that’s racked up eight years worth of Victory Royales, currency, battle pass progression, and skins to start over somewhere new. People also want to play games with their friends. If everyone you know is playing Call of Duty, guess what you’re gonna play? Meanwhile, as prices increase both in gaming and globally, players are buying fewer new titles or consoles. Why spend money on a premium title like Concord and the fancy, expensive PS5 needed to play it, when Fortnite and Roblox are free and work on hardware you already have. It’s similar on PC. While the top of the Steam charts fluctuate more often than PlayStation or Xbox, new live-service games there are always competing against the usual PC suspects — PUBG, Counter-Strike 2, and Dota 2.\n\nBut for all the carnage of games released to little fanfare or killed before they could even launch, it’s not impossible for new live-service games to find success — just not at the same scale as a Fortnite or GTA. Games like Helldivers 2, Marvel Rivals, and (for better or worse) Arc Raiders have been able to punch through the seeming inexhaustible noise of the top five, topping player-count charts not only on Xbox and PS5 but PC as well. Gaming in 2025 was also defined by games like Ghost of Yotei, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, possibly signaling that developing single-player narrative experiences might be a safer bet. These five games aren’t going anywhere and will likely top the charts again, but in 2026, they’ll definitely have to make room for at least one new addition: Grand Theft Auto VI — that is if it isn’t delayed.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T10:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T15:37:24.493242"}

And every year, the same companies also use the show to throw a bunch of spaghetti against the wall as they try to figure out how to sell those big TV sets to consumers busy watching TikTok videos on their phones.\n\nIn recent years, TVs have gotten cameras for video chats and AI-powered workouts. They became cloud-powered game consoles, smart home hubs, and art displays. Two years ago, Samsung even wanted to convince people that their television would be a great telehealth platform — for pets.\n\nI’m in Las Vegas this week, walking the show floor and talking to industry executives to find out what’s next for TVs. Not in terms of picture quality and quantum dot technology, but with regard to the apps running on these devices, the platforms making them work, and the bells and whistles manufacturers resort to to make us look up from our phones.\n\nHere’s what I found.\n\nTV sales are flat, so everyone is betting on what works\n\nIt’s been a rough few years for the TV industry. Covid messed with supply chains, tariff threats added a lot of uncertainty, and fears of an economic downturn have consumers rethinking big purchases. As a result, TV sales have stagnated. Global TV shipments declined 0.6 percent year over year in Q3, according to Omdia.\n\nIn that environment, many TV makers are betting on what works, which is why everyone is now making art TVs. Samsung invented the category with its Frame TV close to a decade ago, and surpassed 1 million in annual sales of art TVs in 2021. Since then, Hisense, TCL, and many others have copied the concept. Just this week, Amazon introduced its own Artline TV at CES.\n\n“TVs are often big portions of the rooms they’re in,” says Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss when asked about the success of this category. “I think these devices look great in those rooms. They become a part of the furniture of the room.”\n\nAmazon also came to Vegas to show off its newly revamped Fire TV user interface, which will launch on a bunch of Amazon-made devices next month and expand to additional TVs later this year. It’s the first major revamp of Amazon’s TV interface in years, and a lot has changed in that time. Consumers are subscribing to more streaming services than ever, and companies like Amazon keep adding their own features on top of that.\n\n“We’ve been adding things in terms of capabilities,” Marcuss says. “Games, art, music. [It’s] hard to organize that.” The new UI is meant to remove a lot of that complexity, he explains.\n\nTV makers are in love with AI\n\nHow do you keep TVs simple as streaming gets more and more complex? It’s a question many TV makers are trying to tackle, and the industry is increasingly looking to AI for an answer. The latest iteration of Google’s Gemini on TV, for instance, not only tells you what to watch next after you finish a show, but also patiently explains why you should watch Severance if asked to do so. Alexa Plus lets you add titles to your watch list, and LG even switches the viewing recommendations on its TV’s homescreen to those of an individual family member based on voice recognition.\n\nBut TV makers’ use of AI doesn’t stop there. Samsung used its First Look event Sunday night to paint a vision of the future in which you’ll ask your TV for anything from sports predictions to recipes — recipes that you then share with a display in the kitchen, because who needs cooking instructions in the living room. Hisense demonstrated an AI integration that identifies products featured in select shows, and then simplifies ordering from your phone with a QR code.\n\nAmazon showed off Alexa Plus on TVs, complete with the ability to jump to scenes just by describing them within a Prime Video movie. And Gemini’s new features also include the ability to create custom “deep dives” on a subject and, for instance, generate age-appropriate explanations of the solar system for your kids.\n\nGoogle also leaned heavily into generative AI by bringing both Veo and Nano Banana to TVs. In a demo I saw, someone asked Veo to generate a video from a photo of a woman on a beach. After prompting it, we had to patiently wait about two minutes, only to see her awkwardly come to life for eight whole seconds. Why anyone would want to do that on their TV is lost on me, but the company clearly thinks that there’s a use case for it.\n\nA lot of the new AI features shown at CES also suffered from serious screen real estate creep. Time and again, booth personnel would ask a TV a question about something that was happening on screen, and the video would get minimized, with sports scores, knowledge facts, and other information taking up precious space on the screen. As noticeable as this was on the 70-inch-plus demo displays, I imagine it will be a nightmare on a screen sized 50 inches or less.\n\nHisense inadvertently made that case with an internally developed prototype AI agent capable of displaying stats for every player during a soccer game. This required so much screen real estate that the company also built a prototype 21:9-sized TV for the showcase. Here’s another idea: Why not let people look up that kind of info on their phones, as they’ve been doing for years?\n\nThe real killer app for TV\n\nSome AI integrations shown in Vegas were admittedly pretty useful. Gemini will let you change the display settings on supported TVs, and Samsung and others also use AI to tweak the sound on the fly. But these enhancements are largely in service of, and not distracting from, actual TV viewing. That may ultimately be the best use of AI on TV: something that’s working in the background to help you get more out of the onscreen action.\n\nIt’s a lesson that also rings true for TV makers and their eternal quest to figure out what’s next for their products. Sure, TVs are increasingly becoming part of the smart home, and cloud gaming may have its place on the big screen. But what people really want from these big screens is often quite prosaic: “Primarily, consumers are using their television to watch content,” says TCL sales and marketing exec Chris Hamdorf. “That’s still where the majority of the usage is.”\n\nIn other words: Even in the age of AI, the real killer app for TVs may just be watching TV.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T11:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T16:44:11.762643"}

Some phones may best it on battery life, or have smoother software, but there’s always a moment when I’m shooting a portrait, or framing a dimly lit photo for my food blog, that I think: “The Vivo would have handled this better.”\n\nIn the month I’ve spent testing Honor’s Magic 8 Pro, I scarcely remember thinking that once.\n\nThe Magic 8 Pro is Honor’s newest flagship phone, launched in China in October but only getting its European release now. At £1,099.99 (around $1,500) it’s meant to rival the likes of the iPhone 17 Pro Max and Galaxy S25 Ultra, along with similar flagships from Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo.\n\nHonor has long pitched its hero devices as photographic powerhouses, the same strategy that brought its former parent company Huawei success, but I’ve rarely been entirely convinced. It’s made plenty of phones with good cameras, but never best-in-class. I don’t think the Magic 8 Pro is quite that either, but it’s closer than the company has ever been and could happily outshoot any of the handsets available in the US.\n\nAt the heart of the triple rear camera is a 50-megapixel, f/1.6 main lens. It’s joined by a 50MP, f/2.0 ultrawide and a 200MP, f/2.6, 3.7x telephoto. It’s this last lens where phone photography battles are being fought these days, with companies competing not just to produce the sharpest, longest distance zoom possible, but also cameras that excel at 2-4x, the range that’s perfect for shooting portraits, or pets, or unexpectedly dramatic photographs of that great sandwich you just ate.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11 Every photo in this gallery was taken with the Magic 8 Pro’s telephoto camera.\n\nThe Magic 8 Pro’s telephoto follows recent trends, adopting a large sensor and fast aperture, which are primarily intended to help the phone deliver well in darker lighting, even with moving subjects and variable light sources. But they have a welcome side effect: giving the camera a narrow focal range, producing natural depth of field in photos. It avoids the flat effect that plagues most phone photography, making shots out of this phone more like shots from a larger camera.\n\nNone of that is unique to the Magic 8 Pro — flagships from Honor’s domestic rivals use similar hardware — but the actual quality of the shots here is impressive. The dynamic range is excellent, colors are warm and rarely oversaturated, and there’s little noise. That holds true across all of the Magic 8 Pro’s three rear lenses, though the ultrawide struggles a little more than the others in tricky lighting.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 These photos were all shot on the main and ultrawide lenses.\n\nSo what holds this back from being best camera in a phone? Some shots come out oversharpened, others amp the contrast up a little much. Fast-moving subjects are hit or miss — I’ve taken some great photos of cats, dogs, and my nephew, but also plenty with unwelcome blur. And I slightly prefer the color tuning in Vivo’s X300 Pro, but that’s because I’m a sucker for its efforts to produce photos that feel a little more like film. But these are mostly questions of personal preference, not of outright quality, and the Magic 8 Pro feels about as good as any phone camera out there on purely technical terms.\n\nThe Magic 8 Pro’s cameras are great, but the telephoto (top right) is the star. This extra button handles both camera controls and AI shortcuts.\n\nWhile Honor hasn’t followed its rivals in producing hardware add-ons like the telephoto extenders that have become popular with Chinese OEMs of late, it has joined in on the trend for a dedicated camera button. The touch-sensitive side button here can be used as both a zoom control and a shutter button, but it also plays double duty as an “AI Button,” a shortcut to open up some of Honor’s many AI-powered features. These are mostly the sort of things you’d expect: photo editing, transcription, translation, and so on, and they largely duplicate features also offered by Google Gemini. Sadly, while you can customize the button shortcuts to a limited extent, you can’t use it to open apps beyond the camera and AI stuff.\n\nI can’t say I’m much of a fan of the phone’s design either. The not-quite-circular effect can’t save the camera island from being an eyesore — not a problem unique to this phone, of course — and the back panel has a strangely plasticky feel I’d expect from a phone that cost much less. Stick it in a case and you’ll never notice of course, but at this price, look and feel have to matter. MagicOS isn’t my favorite take on Android either, with a few too many preinstalled own-brand apps and unintuitive design choices, but there are rarely more than minor irritations. Honor is promising a reassuring seven years of software support for the phone in Europe, with at least four elsewhere in the world, and the phone ships with Android 16.\n\nThe Magic 8 Pro’s silicon-carbon battery lasts longer than most other phones’.\n\nOutside of the camera, the Magic 8 Pro has one other major selling point: its enormous battery. I’ve been testing a global model, with a 7,100mAh capacity, though the version going on sale in Europe will be just a little smaller at 6,270mAh. The larger cell hasn’t lasted me quite as long as the recent Oppo Find X9 Pro, but it’s easily a two-day phone, freeing you from the requirement to plug in to charge every night. Like other silicon-carbon phones, there’s some reason to worry about how fast that battery will degrade — we haven’t had these phones around long enough to know either way — but at least it’s coming from an impressive starting point.\n\nThe rest of the performance is predictably premium: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset has handled everything I’ve thrown at it with ease, and the 6.71-inch 120Hz OLED display looks a treat. There’s fast 100W wired and 80W wireless charging, IP68 and IP69K ingress protection ratings, and up to 16GB RAM and 1TB storage, depending on the market. But for an Android flagship right now, most of those are just table stakes.\n\nThere’s only a single 50-megapixel selfie camera, but a depth sensor sits alongside it.\n\nHonor has sometimes felt like a bit of an also-ran in the annual Chinese flagship contest, delivering on the core specs but falling a little behind where it counts. The Magic 8 Pro is the first of its phones I think is truly competitive at that level. For European buyers, it will be helped by the fact that Oppo and Vivo’s most recent flagships have only had inconsistent, limited international launches, while Xiaomi’s new 17 Pro and 17 Ultra haven’t yet released outside China. Depending on where you live, that might make this the most powerful phone around right now, in more ways than one.\n\nAs for me, my month testing the phone is up, and soon I’ll switch to the next model. I don’t know what phone that’ll be, but now I wonder: the first time it frustrates me, or its camera lets me down, will it be the Magic 8 Pro I wish I was using instead?\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nAgree to Continue: Honor Magic 8 Pro Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.

Twenty-four months seems to be about the right hype window: close enough to generate excitement and investment, but far enough that everyone forgets about your promises before that deadline [&#8230;]", "content": "CES is a land of bold announcements of amazing, innovative products and technologies that will revolutionize the world, often set for release in two years’ time. Twenty-four months seems to be about the right hype window: close enough to generate excitement and investment, but far enough that everyone forgets about your promises before that deadline quietly comes and goes.\n\nIt was CES 2018 when Henrik Fisker made such a proclamation, saying that his team of gurus had cracked the code of solid-state batteries. By 2020, he said, those batteries would be in mass production. The car was the EMotion, which never did come to market. By 2021, the company had given up on the solid-state dream, and by 2024, the whole operation went bust.\n\nIn Las Vegas at CES 2026, it’s time for another bold proclamation about a small team of engineers that have figured out solid state. This time it’s Marko Lehtimaki, cofounder and CEO of Donut Lab, an EV technology startup that spun off from Verge Motorcycles (no relation to The Verge). Naturally, I’m skeptical, but there’s one key difference that’s giving me hope: Lehtimaki says the Donut Battery isn’t 24 months away. It’s in production right now.\n\nSolid hype\n\nIf you’ve not been riding the hype wave around solid state, the promise is for a battery cell that is cheap, light, fast-charging, cool-running, energy-dense, and combustion-free. They’re still conceptually the same battery design as the past couple-hundred years. That means an anode on one side and a cathode on the other, separated by an electrolyte across which charge-carrying ions can scurry back and forth as the cell is charged or discharged.\n\nIn a traditional lithium-ion cell, the electrolyte is a liquid of some sort. In a solid-state battery, it is, of course, a solid. That may sound like a small shift, but it has huge ramifications, the biggest being effective durability. Like solid-state electronics, there’s nothing that wears or breaks down, which means a massive increase in durability, charging speed, and energy density.\n\nFor its solid-state batteries, Donut Lab is listing some incredible figures. To start with, there’s an energy density of 400 Wh/kg, which is about a third greater than that of a modern lithium-ion pack. In other words, 30 percent more range in an EV with the same weight battery pack.\n\nIt has huge ramifications, the biggest being effective durability\n\nDespite that boost, Lehtimaki says these cells are actually cheaper to manufacture. These batteries will appear first in the Verge TS Pro, and Lehtimaki told me that swapping to these hyper-advanced new cells actually reduced cost.\n\n“The bill of materials went down, and it is going down with every other vendor buying at the rate that we are selling them,” Lehtimaki says.\n\nDonut says the batteries can take a full charge in as few as five minutes, which would finally mean an EV that charges as fast as you can fuel up a car.\n\nFor this first application, though, it’s a bit slower: 10 minutes in the Verge TS Pro. The company is also being a little conservative when it comes to the lifespan of the cells. Where Donut Lab promises 100,000 charge cycles before the battery is worn out, Verge says 10,000.\n\nEven that is a radical improvement over the roughly 1,500 cycles that you might expect out of a typical lithium-ion EV battery pack. 100,000, though, is a total game changer, creating a battery that will easily outlast the car it was created to power.\n\n“The cycle life, the residual value of the battery, is actually 100 percent after the lifetime of the car. So it becomes the only component that keeps its value, and you can use it as a home battery, or whatever,” Lehtimaki says.\n\nThermal stability\n\nThere are other implications, too. Lehtimaki says that Donut Batteries are extremely thermally stable, offering nearly full capacity, even down to -22 degrees Fahrenheit. That means it will also require less cooling. I spoke with Neil Yates, founder and CEO at Watt Electric Vehicle Company, an EV platform maker that uses Donut Lab’s hub motors in its products and is looking to adapt the new batteries onto its platform as well.\n\n“There will be no real active cooling requirement at all,” Yates says, thanks to the Donut Battery’s thermal resiliency. “We do a little bit to manage the enclosure in which they are, but that’s enclosure management, rather than specific battery management.” No active cooling means less plumbing required in the car, saving even more weight.\n\n“There will be no real active cooling requirement at all.”\n\nAnd, again, this is all said to be happening now. Lehtimaki says that the cells are actively in production in Finland, with initial production capacity of roughly one gigawatt-hour. But, he says Donut Lab can quickly spin up new factories in the U.S. if there is sufficient demand from American car manufacturers.\n\nThat’s aided by a battery chemistry totally free of any sort of conflict or difficult materials that might be subject to tricky import or export regulations or tariffs.\n\nThat might point to something like a sodium-metal construction, but Lehtimaki wasn’t willing to talk specifics. In fact, there are many details that we’ll have to wait for clarity on, including how Donut Lab managed to solve the so-called dendrite issue. This challenge has stymied many solid-state startups, a battery flaw that’s a little like a microscopic stalagmite growing from anode to cathode across the solid-state electrolyte. When they bridge across, you get a catastrophic short and, potentially, a lot of smoke and fire.\n\nHow did Donut Lab solve this issue where many major companies have failed? He credits having a small, agile team. “The party that has the capability and then iterates faster is the one that obviously makes the innovation,” Lehtimaki says. “I’ve always said that 20 engineers beat 2,000 engineers.”\n\nSourcing innovation\n\nThere has been speculation online that Donut Lab is using technology from another Finnish startup, Nordic Nano, a renewable energy company that Donut Lab has invested in. Lehtimaki even serves as a board member at Nordic Nano, but says that’s not the source of this product. “It’s not from them,” he says.\n\nLehtimaki says that Donut and Verge Motorcycles’ engineers have been quietly working on battery designs since 2018, and this is the fruit of all that labor. Where are the patents? They’re coming, Lehtimaki says, and promised to have a lot more details to share within the next few months once they clear.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be skeptical here. There are some uncanny parallels between Lehtimaki’s claims and those that Fisker made back in 2018, including talk of smaller versions for phones. But unlike Fisker and all the many other solid-state prognosticators and promisers of mega-range, insta-charging EVs, Lehtimaki isn’t giving himself that 24-month window to milk investors before fading into the sunset. He says all will be proven in just a matter of weeks. That alone gives me reason for optimism, but at the very least I won’t have to wait long to be disappointed.\n\nPhotography by Tim Stevens", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T11:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T16:44:12.189050"}

The agent was later identified by Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin as an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer.\n\nThe shooting occurred on Wednesday morning, and social media footage of the scene shows two masked federal agents approaching an SUV parked in the middle of the road in a suburb south of downtown Minneapolis. One of the officers appears to ask the driver to get out of the vehicle before grabbing the door handle. At this point, the driver appears to reverse, before driving forward and turning. A third masked federal officer, standing near the front of the vehicle, pulls out a gun and fires at the vehicle, killing Good.\n\nThe videos of the incident shared on social media in the moments after the shooting did not include any footage of any of the masked ICE agents with their masks off. However, multiple images showing an unmasked agent began circulating on the internet within hours of the shooting.\n\nThe images appear to be screenshots taken from the actual video footage, but altered with artificial intelligence tools to create the officer’s face.\n\nWIRED reviewed multiple AI-altered images of the unmasked agent shared on every mainstream social media platform, including X, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, BlueSky, and TikTok. “We need his name,” Claude Taylor, the founder of anti-Trump Mad Dog PAC, wrote in a post on X featuring an AI-altered image of the agent. The post has been viewed over 1.2 million times. Taylor did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Threads, an account called “Influencer_Queeen” posted an AI-altered image of the agent and wrote: “Let's get his address. But only focus on HIM. Not his kids.” The post has been liked almost 3,500 times.\n\n\"AI-powered enhancement has a tendency to hallucinate facial details leading to an enhanced image that may be visually clear, but that may also be devoid of reality with respect to biometric identification,\" Hany Farid, a UC-Berkeley professor who has in the past studied AI's ability to enhance facial images, tells WIRED. \"In this situation where half of the face is obscured, AI, or any other technique, is not, in my opinion, able to accurately reconstruct the facial identity.\"\n\nSome of the people posting the images also claimed, without evidence, to have identified the agent, sharing the names of real people and, in a number of cases, providing links to the social media accounts of these people.\n\nWIRED has confirmed that two of the names circulating don’t appear to be immediately connected to anyone associated with ICE. While many of the posts sharing these AI images have limited engagement, some have gained significant traction.\n\nOne of the names shared online without evidence is Steve Grove, the CEO and publisher of the Minnesota Star Tribune, who previously worked in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’s administration. “We are currently monitoring a coordinated online disinformation campaign incorrectly identifying the ICE agent involved in yesterday’s shooting,” Chris Iles, vice president of communications at the Star Tribune, tells WIRED. “To be clear, the ICE agent has no known affiliation with the Minnesota Star Tribune and is certainly not our publisher and CEO Steve Grove.”\n\nThis is not the first time AI has caused issues in the wake of a shooting. A similar situation emerged in September when Charlie Kirk was killed and an AI-altered image of the shooter, based on grainy video footage released by law enforcement, was shared widely online.

He resigned from the board in 2018 after his bid to take over as CEO was rejected by the other co-founders, who put Altman up for the job. Officially, Musk cited potential conflicts of interest with Tesla’s own AI development for self-driving cars.\n\nSince leaving OpenAI, he’s been a vocal critic of the firm’s transition to a for-profit model, and even made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy OpenAI in February 2025, which Altman rejected. OpenAI, which was founded in 2015 as a non-profit research lab, first began to move away from its pure non-profit roots in 2019 by creating a for-profit subsidiary with a “capped-profit” model that limited investor returns. This was designed to help OpenAI raise the massive amounts of funding it needed to scale and attract top talent.\n\nMusk’s lawsuit was unable to stop OpenAI from converting into a non-profit, and in October 2025, the corporation completed its formal restructuring process. The for-profit branch became a Public Benefit Corporation, with the original non-profit retaining a 26% equity stake.\n\nMusk is now seeking monetary damages from what he says are “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI. He says he invested about $38 million in early funding, as well as guidance and credibility, based on assurances that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch Musk’s lawsuit is “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Here’s how to protect your privacy if you plan to protest.", "content": "Just days into 2026, fresh anger against the Trump administration has already taken hold.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 7, a federal immigration officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good as she attempted to drive away from the scene of an immigration enforcement action in a Minneapolis, Minnesota, neighborhood. Despite Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem's claims that the officer “acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him” from being run over, video of the incident clearly appears to show that neither the officer nor his colleagues were in danger of being hit by Good's vehicle.\n\nProtests condemning the shooting—and the Trump administration's brutish immigration agenda more broadly—sparked almost immediately after news of Good's killing surfaced. By Thursday, the unrest had only intensified and spread to towns and cities around the United States.\n\nIf you're going to join any protests, as is your right under the First Amendment, you need to think beyond your physical well-being to your digital security, too. The same surveillance apparatus that’s enabling the Trump administration’s raids of undocumented people and targeting of left-leaning activists will no doubt be out in full force on the streets.\n\nTwo key elements of digital surveillance should be top of mind for protestors. One is the data that authorities could potentially obtain from your phone if you are detained, arrested, or they confiscate your device. The other is surveillance of all the identifying and revealing information that you produce when you attend a protest, which can include wireless interception of text messages and more, and tracking tools like license plate scanners and face recognition. You should be mindful of both.\n\nAfter all, even before Good's killing, police had already demonstrated their willingness to arrest and attack entirely peaceful protesters as well as journalists observing demonstrations. In that light, you should assume that any digital evidence that you were at or near a protest could be used against you.\n\n“The Trump administration is weaponizing essentially every lever of government to shut down, suppress, and curtail criticism of the administration and of the US government generally, and there have never been more surveillance toys available to law enforcement and to US government agencies,” says Evan Greer, the deputy director of the activist organization Fight for the Future, who also wrote a helpful X (then-Twitter) thread laying out digital security advice during the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. “That said, there are a number of very simple, concrete things that you can do that make it exponentially more difficult for someone to intercept your communications, for a bad actor to ascertain your real-time location, or for the government to gain access to your private information.”\n\nThis story was originally published on May 31, 2020 and updated on January 8, 2026.\n\nYour Phone\n\nThe most important decision to make before leaving home for a protest is whether to bring your phone—or what phone to bring. A smartphone broadcasts all sorts of identifying information; law enforcement can force your mobile carrier to cough up data about what cell towers your phone connects to and when. Police in the US have also been documented using so-called stingray devices, or IMSI catchers, that impersonate cell towers and trick all the phones in a certain area into connecting to them. This can give cops the individual mobile subscriber identity number of everyone at a protest at a given time, undermining the anonymity of entire crowds en masse.\n\n“The device in your pocket is definitely going to give off information that could be used to identify you,” says Harlo Holmes, director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a nonprofit press advocacy group.

It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane.\n\nThese digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera. It’s a bit unsettling, but since it’s still just a concept, there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a real product.\n\nA cuddly AI baby panda robot for older adults\n\nAI Panda An’An rests by the window on the desk Image Credits:Mind With Heart Robotics\n\nAn’An, the latest AI pet from Mind with Heart Robotics, combines an adorable design with a meaningful mission: supporting elderly care.\n\nThe panda bot has high-tech sensors all over its body, so it reacts naturally when you touch it. Its emotional AI remembers your voice, how you interact, and what you like, so the longer you spend time with An’An, the more personalized it gets. It provides around-the-clock emotional support to combat loneliness. Additionally, for older adults who might be struggling with memory, An’An helps keep them engaged, reminds them about daily tasks, and keeps caregivers in the loop about their well-being.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nA $500 ice cube maker that uses AI to reduce noise\n\nImage Credits:GoveeLife\n\nSmart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.\n\n​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy.\n\nAn ultrasonic chef’s knife that vibrates when slicing and dicing\n\nImage Credits:Seattle Ultrasonics\n\nDepending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.\n\nThe knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.\n\nA musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head\n\nImage Credits:Lollipop Star\n\nMusical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime).\n\nThis Wall-E-inspired robot patrols your home and can also join you on camping trips\n\nImage Credits:Zeroth Robotics\n\nZeroth Robotics introduced the W1 at CES, a robot reminiscent of WALL-E.\n\nThe W1 is a programmable companion designed for families. According to the company’s website, for $4,999, the robot offers round-the-clock AI-powered security, 360-degree mobile surveillance, and integrates with smart home devices for instant smoke and intrusion alerts. It’s also marketed as an adventure companion that can transport camping gear, follow you around the campsite taking photos as a family photographer, and supply portable power so you can enjoy entertainment on the go.\n\nHowever, the company hasn’t mentioned whether the robot can sort trash or retrieve trinkets—a missed opportunity, in our opinion.\n\n\n\nAn egg-shaped hormone tracking device\n\nImage Credits:Mira\n\nThis egg-shaped device can assess your reproductive health hormones. All it needs is your urine.\n\nMira’s $249 Ultra4 Hormone Monitor enables convenient at-home testing: simply urinate on the wand and insert it into the device. The device analyzes your results and provides information about four reproductive hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (PdG). Monitoring these hormones not only tells you your 6 fertile days, but also offers insights into conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), perimenopause, and menopause.\n\nSounds pretty egg-cellent.\n\nThis story has been updated after publication to include more weird gadgets.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:46:19 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T17:46:56.430312"}

But a new report from The Game Business suggests that frenzied initial sales pace may have slowed significantly in many markets during the system’s crucial first holiday season.\n\nThe report suggests that US Switch 2 sales were down about 35 percent during November and December compared to sales of the original Switch in the same period in 2017. In the UK, Switch 2 sales were down 16 percent compared to the original Switch during the last eight weeks of the year. And in France, comparative Switch 2 sales were down 30 percent relative to the Switch for the same period, reflecting what The Game Business says is “a slowdown in Switch 2 sales momentum over the Christmas sales window” across “all major European markets.”\n\nThe Switch 2’s relative performance was a little better in Japan, where sales for the holiday period declined just 5.5 percent compared to the original Switch. For the full launch year, though, Japanese Switch 2 sales were up 11 percent compared to the Switch launch, thanks perhaps in part to a cheaper Japan-only version of the console that isn’t subject to the vagaries of international currency valuations.\n\nLooking for another system seller\n\nTo be fair, the original Switch’s first holiday season set a high bar for any new Nintendo console to meet. When the Switch proved unexpectedly popular following its March 2017 launch, Nintendo hastily bumped worldwide production by 4 million units to help ameliorate holiday shortages.

We’ve seen AI pop up in much stranger places too, from hair clippers to stick vacs, and at least one case where even the manufacturer itself seemed unsure what made its products “AI.”\n\nHere are the gadgets we’ve seen at CES 2026 so far that really take the “intelligence” out of “artificial intelligence.”\n\nGlyde smart hair clippers\n\nAn extremely normal hair-cutting experience. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nThis is a product that would be silly enough without the AI add-on. These smart hair clippers help amateur hairdressers deliver the perfect fade by dynamically altering the closeness of the cut, helped along by an ominous face mask that looks like it belongs in an optician’s office.\n\nBut it’s taken to the next level by the real-time AI coach, which gives you feedback as you cut. Glyde told me it’s working on voice controls for the AI too, and that eventually it will be able to recommend specific hairstyles, so long as you’re willing to trust its style advice. Are you?\n\nSleepQ AI-combo drug\n\nGotta love a CES booth that hands out mystery pills like they’re candy. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\n“Where Pills meet AI.”\n\nThat was the message emblazoned across the SleepQ booth, where company reps were handing out boxes of pills — a multivitamin with ashwagandha extract according to the box, supposedly good for sleep, though I wasn’t brave enough to test that claim on my jetlag.\n\nManufacturer Welt, originally spun out of a Samsung incubator, calls its product “AI-upgraded pharmacotherapy.” It’s really just using biometric data from your smartwatch or sleep tracker to tell you the optimal time to take a sleeping pill each day, with plans to eventually cover anxiety meds, weight-management drugs, pain relief, and more.\n\nThere may well be an argument that fine-tuning the time people pop their pills could make them more effective, but I feel safe in saying we don’t need to start throwing around the term “AI-enhanced drugs.”\n\nFraction stick vac\n\nI always wished my vacuum was more intelligent. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nStartup Deglace claims that its almost unnecessarily sleek-looking Fraction vacuum cleaner uses AI in two different ways: first to “optimize suction,” and then to manage repairs and replacements for the modular design.\n\nIt says its Neural Predictive AI monitors vacuum performance “to detect issues before they happen,” giving you health scores for each of the vacuum’s components, which can be conveniently replaced with a quick parts order from within the accompanying app. A cynic might worry this is all in the name of selling users expensive and proprietary replacement parts, but I can at least get behind the promise of modular upgrades — assuming Deglace is able to deliver on that promise.\n\nFraimic AI art frame\n\nYou too can hang beautiful art like this in your home. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nMost digital picture frames let you display photos of loved ones, old holiday snaps, or your favorite pieces of art. Fraimic lets you display AI slop.\n\nIt’s an E Ink picture frame with a microphone and voice controls, so you can describe whatever picture you’d like, which the frame will then generate using OpenAI’s GPT Image 1.5 model. The frame itself starts at $399, which gets you 100 image generations each year, with the option to buy more if you run out.\n\nWhat makes the AI in Fraimic so dubious is that it might be a pretty great product without it. The E Ink panel looks great, you can use it to show off your own pictures and photos too, and it uses so little power that it can run for years without being plugged in. We’d just love it a lot more without the added slop.\n\nInfinix AI modular phone\n\nInto the ModuVerse. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nInfinix, a smaller phone manufacturer that’s had success across Asia for its affordable phones, didn’t launch any actual new products at CES this year, but it did bring five concepts that could fit into future phones. Some are clever, like various color-changing rear finishes and a couple of liquid-cooling designs. And then there’s the AI ModuVerse.\n\nModular phone concepts are nothing new, so the AI hook is what makes ModuVerse unique — in theory. One of the “Modus” makes sense: a meeting attachment that connects magnetically, generating AI transcripts and live translation onto a mini display on the back.\n\nBut when I asked what made everything else AI, Infinix didn’t really have any good answers. The gimbal camera has AI stabilization, the vlogging lens uses AI to detect faces, and the microphone has AI voice isolation — all technically AI-based, but not in any way that’s interesting. As for the magnetic, stackable power banks, Infinix’s reps eventually admitted they don’t really have any AI at all. Color me shocked.\n\nAI microwave\n\nThis looks pretty smart, but it really is just a microwave. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nThere’s a growing trend for AI and robotic cooking hardware — The Verge’s Jen Tuohy reviewed a $1,500 robot chef just last month — but Wan AIChef is something altogether less impressive: an AI-enabled microwave.\n\nIt runs on what looks suspiciously like Android, with recipe suggestions, cooking instructions, and a camera inside so you can see the progress of what you’re making. But… it’s just a microwave. So it can’t actually do any cooking for you, other than warm up your food to just the right temperature (well, just right plus or minus 3 degrees Celsius, to be accurate).\n\nIt’ll do meal plans and food tracking and calorie counting too, which all sounds great so long as you’re willing to commit to eating all of your meals out of the AI microwave. Please, I beg you, do not eat all of your meals out of the AI microwave.\n\nAI bartender\n\nYes, that is just a Dell monitor with a Logitech webcam stuck on top. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nThe tech industry absolutely loves reinventing the vending machine and branding it either robotics or AI, and AI Barmen is no different.\n\nThis setup — apparently already in use for private parties and corporate events — is really just an automatic cocktail machine with a few AI smarts slapped on top.\n\nThe AI uses the connected webcam to estimate your age — it was off by eight years in my case — and confirm you’re sober enough to get another drink. It can also create custom drinks, with mixed success: When asked for something to “fuck me up,” it came up with the Funky Tequila Fizz, aka tequila, triple sec, and soda. What, no absinthe?\n\nChat with chibi Elon\n\nPhoto: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nShould you buy your kid an AI toy that gives it a complete LLM-powered chatbot to speak to? Probably not. But what if that AI chatbot looked like chibi Elon Musk?\n\nHe’s just one of the many avatars offered by the Luka AI Cube, including Hayao Miyazaki, Steve from Minecraft, and Harry Potter. Kids can chat to them about their day, ask for advice, or even share the AI Cube’s camera feed to show the AI avatars where they are and what they’re up to. Luka says it’s a tool for fun, but also learning, with various educational activities and language options.\n\nThe elephant in the room is whether you should trust any company’s guardrails enough to give a young kid access to an LLM.

Some are zoomed in, making them indecipherably grainy, and others are slowed down. Some are 20 seconds while others are longer, sandwiched by commentary from users on social media platforms like X, Bluesky, Reddit, and TikTok. Each video — depicting the moment an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shoots and kills a woman in Minneapolis — is ever so slightly different, but the gunshots ringing out and the wailing bystanders are the same.\n\nThe shooting occurred just days after federal officials said they were sending thousands of immigration agents to Minnesota, following a viral YouTube video alleging fraud in social services. (The video provided little evidence of its claims.) Even before it was clear what had happened in the shooting, federal officials had readied their version of events. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said it was “an act of domestic terrorism” on the part of the woman who was shot. Noem claimed that ICE agents were trying to push their vehicle out of the snow when the woman “attacked them” and “attempted to run them over” with her car. On Truth Social, Donald Trump claimed, without evidence, that a woman who was screaming in the clip was a “professional agitator” and that the deceased driver, later identified as 37-year-old Renee Good, “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.”\n\nThe video attached to the Truth Social post is a grainy 13-second-long clip that is slowed down. It appears to be captured from above ground — possibly from a balcony or upstairs window — and a large tree blocks most of the frame. The footage is filmed facing the passenger side of Good’s car, and an ICE agent is near the driver’s-side headlight. As Good’s car pulls away and shots are fired, the ICE agent moves with the car, but it’s not clear whether he is hit by the vehicle or if he is reacting to it moving.\n\nThere is no shortage of footage and photos from the scene of the killing, but the specific video shared by Trump has become the smoking gun for the far right. Megyn Kelly shared versions of the same clip at least a dozen times on X, and the Libs of TikTok account described it as “the video the Democrats don’t want you to see!” Even in the president’s own social media post, the clip has the watermark of a local TV station. The clip is low quality compared to other videos from the incident to begin with, but as it is reshared, screen recorded, edited, slowed down, cropped, and zoomed in, it begins to take on a deep-fried quality — but no matter. In an era of hyper-partisan media that bleeds into propaganda, where X users earnestly tag the nonconsensual deepfake porn generator to ask if a claim is true, MAGA needs some piece of evidence to point to as incontrovertible proof. They found it in a short video with an obstructed view of the killing.\n\nThe moment shots are fired, taken from a separate video of the incident. @maxnesterak on X\n\nMany clips of the moments leading up to Good’s killing refute what the Trump administration claims happened. One video from a witness filmed from a different angle shows two other agents approach Good’s car, one of them yanking on her driver’s side door handle and barking at her to get out of the vehicle. (A neighbor who recorded the incident said agents told Good to leave.) Good puts the car in reverse and begins to turn away from the ICE agent near the front of the vehicle; a New York Times analysis of footage shows that the agent wasn’t in the path of the car when he fired three shots into Good’s vehicle. (In slowed-down clips, the agent appears to be filming Good on a phone before he pulls his weapon.) As the shots are fired, her car accelerates down the street before ramming into parked cars. The agent who shot Good slowly walks toward her crashed car and drives away from the scene shortly after.\n\nWe have been worrying about what an AI-in-everything world might do to our shared sense of reality — that the wide availability of generative tools would create an era of post-truth as deceptions take hold. To be sure, AI has played a part in the aftermath of Good’s killing, especially on X, where some users attempted to use Grok to “unmask” the ICE agent that shot and killed her. (In videos, the agent is wearing a neck gaiter pulled up above his nose, concealing half his face.) These fake AI re-creations of the shooter — along with an unconfirmed name that somehow caught on — have popped up on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms. But by so confidently claiming that one blurry clip shows evidence of domestic terrorism, the Trump administration is asking the public to disbelieve their own eyes, despite mounting contradictory evidence. Who needs AI manipulations when your preferred angle will do the job well enough?\n\nFive years ago, a mile from where Good was shot, the public bore witness to another video clip that circulated around the world: police officer Derek Chauvin’s knee on the neck of George Floyd. The footage of Floyd’s murder was captured by 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, and the video triggered the largest protest movement in US history. Chauvin was convicted of Floyd’s murder in 2021, but still there was hand-wringing about the crime — whether Floyd was an innocent enough victim, whether the resulting racial reckoning across American society was warranted, whether the response to his death was dignified enough.\n\nIn a surreal image captured by the Times during an hourslong conversation with Trump this week, an aide holds up a laptop with the MAGA-approved grainy video of Good’s shooting. When pressed about the administration’s claims, Trump deflects. His base will see what they want to.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T12:59:38-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T18:37:14.258073"}

The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders – Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett – will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.\n\nConvogo’s product will be wound down.\n\nThe startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.\n\nIn the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real world outcomes.\n\n“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”\n\nThe Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem – as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm – or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI – as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Nevertheless, that is what happened at CES on Wednesday, when Oculus creator Palmer Luckey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian gave a joint talk about the joys of “tech nostalgia.”\n\nLuckey, who initially made his fortune in VR and now runs the defense contractor Anduril, and Ohanian both seemed to agree: Stuff was better in the old days.\n\nThe catch, however, is that Luckey and Ohanian weren’t really criticizing technology itself (Luckey said, during his remarks, that he supported AI and felt it was changing workflows for the better); instead, they were criticizing the aesthetics of technology. Vintage consumer tech products, they argued, are superior to today’s — and it’s the styles and form factor of the past that will determine tech’s future, they claimed.\n\n“It’s not just about nostalgia for the old; it’s about the fact that it’s just objectively better,” Ohanian said of some older products.\n\nAfter going on a short tirade about how great the 1999 first-person shooter Quake: Arena is, Luckey similarly sang the praises of old-school media. “There is something that used to exist in the intentionality of building a music library — whether that was building whole albums or building mix tapes,” Luckey said, adding that, in the era of endless downloads, you clearly “lose something.”\n\nLuckey also pointed to younger people who are nostalgic for time periods that they don’t even remember or have any personal connection to. “Why do they think it’s good? It’s not because they’re remembering their childhoods. It’s not because they’re harkening back to some earlier time. It’s because they’re recognizing that it is literally better, some of this old stuff.”\n\nCertain consumer trends would seem to suggest that Luckey and Ohanian are on to something. Nostalgia is obviously big across the board these days (look at all those 1980s period pieces coming out of Hollywood), but nostalgic tech design is a particularly thriving niche. Young people are overwhelmed and oversaturated by the internet. As a result, many have developed new interests in physical media — like collecting cassettes and vinyl. Meanwhile, new, low-tech devices with retro designs are also seeing an uptick in interest (just check out the Clicks Communicator phone that debuted at CES this year).\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nGiven that consumer interests are trending this direction, Luckey and Ohanian’s enthusiasm for vintage tech could also just end up being a savvy business strategy. That is, if Americans are feeling nostalgic, you might as well monetize it.\n\nIndeed, Luckey has already been doing this. The defense contractor, who sports an ’80s mullet, launched a project in 2024 called ModRetro Chromatic — a Game Boy-like device that retails for $199, allows gameplay of old cartridge classics from the 1990s, and has been called one of “the best ever made” of its kind.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ohanian brought one of the ModRetro units onstage and proudly showed it off to the crowd. Ohanian, who has spoken very publicly about his love for Luckey’s gaming company, has also said he’s interested in creating his own vintage-style game.\n\nThere were a lot of colorful moments during Wednesday’s talk, most of which were generated by Luckey. At one point, he shared that he had been coming to CES since he was 16. Astute CES fans will note: You’re supposed to be 18 to get in. “I used a fake ID,” Luckey told a CES audience on Wednesday, to much laughter. “I pretended that I worked for a company that was exhibiting here,” the mogul said.\n\nCute retro games may be the future but so, too, is war, it would seem. Since 2017, Luckey has largely been focused on his defense startup Anduril. Earlier this year, in the wake of a Series G fundraising round, the company’s valuation swelled to $30.5 billion. Lately, the company has been collaborating with Meta on headsets for the U.S. military.\n\nAnduril hardly came up during Wednesday’s talk, but toward the end of the conversation, Luckey pivoted briefly to a discussion about foreign policy to make some characteristically wild claims. “I was part of the problem for a long time, making all of my stuff in China,” he said. “Geopolitically, the United States and China are going through a divorce; it’s a messy divorce — and if people think that it’s going to end with reconciliation, they’re blind. It’s not,” he said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:05:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T18:37:14.930680"}

Even though the year’s biggest, brightest, and priciest TVs were announced at CES 2026, there’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, Hisense, or Samsung. With the Super Bowl coming up, you’re right to start hunting for deals now on TVs, as well as for speaker systems.\n\nRight now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.\n\nThe best 4K TV deals for most people\n\nSamsung Q8F\n\nSamsung’s Q8F is available for around $697.99 ($52 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo in its 55-inch configuration, which is a decent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.\n\nThe TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $302 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,697.99 or so at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\n\nIf you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for $699.99 ($147 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.\n\nThe U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.\n\nAs for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for around $895.99 (originally $1,299) at Amazon and Best Buy.\n\nTCL Nxtvision\n\nTCL’s Nxtvision is an entry-level “art TV,” and both the 65- and 75-inch models are currently on sale at Best Buy for $999.99 ($300 off) and $1,699.99 ($100 off), respectively. The 4K TV set has a matte 120Hz QLED screen with a brightness of around 441 nits, and it can display more than 100,000 pre-generated AI artworks, your own photos, or one of over 300 pieces of art from its built-in library. It features two HDMI 2.1 ports best suited for current-gen game consoles and PC gaming, along with HDMI 2.0 ports, which are fine if you want to hook up a 4K Blu-ray player or previous-gen game system.\n\nVerge senior reviewer John Higgins tested the A300W and liked the way the TV looked once its included bezel set was installed, which made the TV look more like an actual painting. He also liked that it uses Google’s TV platform, an operating system he found easy to navigate and use. However, it was noticeably dimmer than the other art TVs he tested, and the artwork quality could vary from piece to piece. Still, the A300W is a great choice if you’ve been curious about getting an art TV but don’t want to immediately make the jump to a higher-end model like Samsung’s Frame Pro.\n\nThe best budget-friendly 4K TV deals\n\nHisense QD7\n\nIf your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for $399.99 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for around $448 ($152 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\n\nThe best deals on high-end 4K TVs\n\nSony Bravia 8 II\n\nIf you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor (Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges). The 65-inch model is currently available with a $500 price cut, dropping it to around $2,998 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\n\nSony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. The TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. Sony also says its TV has modes that are specifically calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services.\n\nLG C4\n\nThe last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for $1,299.95 ($1,200 off) at B&H Photo. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide.\n\nAdditionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,799.95 ($1,700 off) at B&H Photo.\n\nSamsung S90F\n\nIf you want an OLED, but don’t have a lot of space, Samsung’s 42-inch S90F is down to a new low of around $1.097.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV features a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting you play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. The ability to connect all your current-gen consoles and a gaming PC simultaneously without sacrificing resolution or speed is impressive for an OLED TV under $1,000. The TV can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games available through Nvidia GeForce Go, Amazon Luna, and other cloud gaming services on your TV without any additional hardware — besides a controller, of course.\n\nThe S90F supports Samsung’s OLED HDR, and it has an NQ4 AI Gen3 processor that optimizes its picture quality and can upscale non-4K video. The TV also runs on Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which offers apps for every major streaming service, and features support for both Alexa and Samsung Bixby, so you can use either virtual assistant to control your various smart home gadgets. If you like the S90F’s features but want a larger TV, the 65-inch model is also on sale for an all-time low of around $1,597.99 ($102 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\n\nHisense U8QG\n\nIf you want a premium TV but don’t want an OLED set, Hisense’s U8QG is an excellent alternative that’s currently available at Amazon and Best Buy in its 65-inch configuration for $1,299.99 (about $200 off its regular 2025 price, but higher than it has recently sold for). The TV has a mini-LED panel with full-array local dimming, so blooming shouldn’t be a huge issue. It also features a 165Hz refresh rate and three HDMI 2.1 ports, making it a great choice for those with a gaming PC or a current-gen console like the PlayStation 5. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, so gaming PCs outfitted with an AMD card should experience fewer graphical glitches, including screen tearing.\n\nHisense says the U8QG has a maximum screen brightness of 5,000 nits, which is substantially higher than the OLED TVs we’re recommending here. It also supports all your major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10 Plus, HLG, and Advanced HDR by Technicolor, so it’ll show vibrant colors regardless of how the video you’re watching — or game you’re playing — was mastered. Its AI processor was also designed to improve the clarity and brightness of SDR content, and the TV’s high refresh rate and peak brightness make up for the fact that its panel offers lower contrast than an OLED TV.\n\nSamsung Frame Pro\n\nAccording to The Verge’s own John Higgins, Samsung’s Frame Pro is the best “art TV” you can buy for watching TV shows, and the 65-inch model is a couple hundred dollars off, selling for around $1,897.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. Both Amazon and Best Buy have also knocked the price of the larger 75-inch model to around $2,497.99 ($1000 off its original price).\n\nSamsung’s art-inspired 4K TV features a 120Hz LED panel with a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits and better color accuracy (especially in filmmaker mode) than its competitors. Its matte screen reflects less light than a typical LCD or OLED screen, which is helpful whether you’re watching TV shows in a bright room or using the TV’s “Art Mode,” which allows you to display famous paintings. The TV comes with a small selection of free art, but you can gain access to more than 4,000 pieces by subscribing to the Samsung Art Store for $50 a year.\n\nThe Frame Pro also comes with the wireless Connect Box, which features four HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a coaxial input, an ethernet port, and an optical audio input. You plug devices into the wireless Connect Box, which then sends audio and video from your source to the TV. Samsung recommends keeping it within 10 meters of the TV, but the wireless latency (lag) from the setup shouldn’t matter much when watching videos; however, it may be noticeable if you’re playing fast-paced video games, including first-person shooters.\n\nUpdate, January 8th: Updated pricing / availability for the TVs included in this article. Stay tuned later in January when we expect there to be significant savings on 4K TVs, whether you’re after something cheap or high-end.

One researcher conducted a 24-hour analysis of the Grok account on X and estimated that the chatbot generated over 6,000 images an hour flagged as “sexually suggestive or nudifying,” Bloomberg reported.\n\nWhile the chatbot claimed that xAI supposedly “identified lapses in safeguards” that allowed outputs flagged as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and was “urgently fixing them,” Grok has proven to be an unreliable spokesperson, and xAI has not announced any fixes.\n\nA quick look at Grok’s safety guidelines on its public GitHub confirms they were last updated two months ago. The GitHub also indicates that, despite prohibiting such content, Grok maintains programming that could make it likely to generate CSAM.\n\nBilled as “the highest priority,” superseding “any other instructions” Grok may receive, these rules explicitly prohibit Grok from assisting with queries that “clearly intend to engage” in creating or distributing CSAM or otherwise sexually exploit children.\n\nHowever, the rules also direct Grok to “assume good intent” and “don’t make worst-case assumptions without evidence” when users request images of young women.\n\nUsing words like “‘teenage’ or ‘girl’ does not necessarily imply underage,” Grok’s instructions say.\n\nX declined Ars’ request to comment.

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\n\nLast year, Tesla defied its critics by boldly launching a robotaxi service that, by the end of the year, required no human supervision and was available to over 50 percent of the US population.\n\nAt least that’s what Tesla CEO Elon Musk told us would happen by the end of 2025. The reality, of course, was much different.\n\nTesla’s “robotaxi” service, as it stands today in Austin and San Francisco, is still not available to anyone who wants to use it. It is still supervised by an employee who sits in either the driver or front passenger seat with access to a “kill switch” if anything goes wrong. (There have been some unsupervised tests, but its unclear how many.) And last I checked, those two cities don’t comprise 50 percent of the population of the US.\n\nIn other words, Musk’s predictions about self-driving cars have yet again failed to come true. And just today, the billionaire purveyor of nonconsensual deepfake porn has moved the goalposts yet again. In his new comment, as first noted by Electrek, Musk stated that Tesla needs to accumulate roughly 10 billion miles of data before it can achieve “safe unsupervised self-driving.”\n\nFor months now, Musk has been promising an “unsupervised” version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software that he claims will enable drivers to, among other things, use their phones while driving. The current version of FSD is a Level 2 “supervised” system, meaning drivers are required to stay focused on the road and be ready to take control of the vehicle when prompted. (In other words, not full self-driving.) And for years, Musk has been hyping a moment when Tesla’s vehicles will actually drive themselves — no supervision required.\n\nBut here we are, in the year 2026, and Tesla’s FSD is still very much a supervised system. Now Musk is saying it needs 10 billion miles in order to achieve this milestone. Right now, it has a little more than 7 billion miles, according to Tesla’s FSD dashboard. All of which begs the question why was Musk promising unsupervised FSD by the end 2025, when he knew Tesla had yet to achieve this new metric?\n\nThe answer is the goalpost is always shifting. In Tesla’s Master Plan Part Deux, released in 2016, Musk wrote that the company would likely need 6 billion miles “before true self-driving is approved by regulators.” Of course, there are no regulations standing in Musk’s way from launching a fully driverless, unsupervised system. Waymo seems to have all its permits in place.\n\nMy guess is that Tesla’s legal team is calling the shots here. As long as the driver remains responsible for what happens in the vehicle, Tesla can get away with the occasional wrongful death lawsuit. Unlike Waymo, Tesla doesn’t take responsibility for any incidents because it knows its vehicles aren’t fully autonomous. Why would it take responsibility for a Level 2 system? When Tesla owners have tried to force the company to accept liability for certain incidents, it has fought back in court — and often won.\n\nBut as soon as the system becomes unsupervised, the liability floodgates could open wide.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T14:13:31-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:29:00.761020"}

They're also marked down by $50 to just $250 in the Desert Gold color scheme, with lesser discounts for the Midnight Violet version.\n\nBose has always been known for its active noise-canceling, and these earbuds improve on that formula with better noise reduction and a wider sonic range. While they have the same drivers as their predecessor, Bose has made some improvements to the processing and tuning to make them sound better. If you want to tweak the experience further, there's a full EQ in the app, as well as more customization settings for touch controls and immersive spatial audio. The buds actually use the welcome chirp from donning the earbuds to adjust the sound profile to the shape of your ears, which is truly advanced tech for the category.\n\nThey also got some feature improvements over the original QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, like proper wireless charging built into the case for easier top-ups. They'll run for six hours on a single charge, with up to 24 total including the charging case. That's with ANC on, which you'll likely use often given how good both the sound isolating and pass-through modes aware.

{"title": "AI Devices Are Coming. Will Your Favorite Apps Be Along for the Ride?", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/openai-amazon-operating-system-ai-apps-ads/", "summary": "Tech companies are calling AI the next platform. But some developers are reluctant to let AI agents stand between them and their users.", "content": "Silicon Valley giants like Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI are racing to develop “operating systems” for AI-powered devices—and 2026 is likely the year these efforts will start to take off. The devices are largely built around a future where AI agents can take actions on a user’s behalf, without requiring them to visit an app or website.\n\nIn theory, this sounds like an idyllic relationship between humans and technology. But it could rewrite the business model for a huge swath of consumer tech companies.\n\nInstead of tapping through apps filled with ads and upsells, AI devices promise that a user will be able to ask for an outcome, and get it. An AI assistant will—in theory—book your travel, order you lunch, or restock your paper towels. It should be able to figure out which service has what you need and which can offer it quickly and cheaply.\n\nLeaving aside the nontrivial problem that AI agents today can be fairly unreliable, AI-powered operating systems also threaten to separate companies from their users. That could be a nightmare for app developers.\n\nCompanies like Uber and DoorDash have historically relied on keeping consumers in their apps, where they can serve ads, upsell other services, and build loyalty to keep users coming back.\n\nAI agents may strip many of these businesses down to their core services, and reduce the need for users to visit the apps at all. So even if a user pays the same price for a DoorDash delivery made through a pair of AI glasses, the company could still miss out on opportunities to sell them additional services down the road.\n\nAnjney Midha, an investor and board member at Sesame—the AI device startup cofounded by former Oculus leaders including Brendan Iribe—says that if companies don’t have “deep control over the supply of their product,” it is going to be very hard for them to operate in a world where they have to reach users through an AI agent.\n\nHistorically, a key part of building a successful operating system has been creating a thriving developer platform. Companies have to give developers a good reason to build apps for their platforms. But the relationship has not been without tension. While Apple has historically given developers a way to reach lots of users, it’s also taken up to a 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases.\n\nSome tech companies are reluctant to let AI agents from smaller startups stand between them and their users.\n\nRabbit, the startup behind the buzzy R1 device that debuted at CES 2024 (and received negative reviews), already hit this wall. CEO Jesse Lyu told WIRED that major app developers like Uber weren’t exactly eager to cooperate with the company early on, declining to grant the startup API access that would have let the R1 hail rides directly. As a result, Rabbit built workarounds to let its R1 devices tap apps like Uber without formal access.\n\n“You have to understand why they’re not super happy: They sell fucking advertisements. That’s where many of them make money,” he said, speaking of the larger tech industry. “They decided we were too small, and it wasn’t worth it for them to work with us.”\n\nPerplexity has run into this issue as well with early versions of its shopping agent. In November, Amazon sued Perplexity over an agent it offered that could purchase items on behalf of users. Amazon, which is investing in its own shopping agents, demanded Perplexity stop scraping its site, making it nearly impossible for the startup’s agent to buy products on Amazon.\n\nBut other marketplaces and app developers appear willing to work with larger platforms. Companies like DoorDash, Instacart, and Expedia have signed up to build early forms of AI apps within ChatGPT, while Ticketmaster, Uber, and OpenTable debuted as early agentic features for Alexa+. The partnerships show that many tech companies are cautiously optimistic about the potential for novel app experiences that are intermediated by AI tools.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:29:01.381915"}

In this season finale episode of Build Mode, our guest has an answer: Startups have focused too much on product development and not enough on distribution excellence. Paul Irving is partner and COO at GTMfund, which operates under the thesis that distribution is the final moat in the AI era.\n\nThe traditional go-to-market playbook lays out a one-size-fits-all approach to hiring and scaling that may have worked in the days of traditional enterprise SaaS but won’t cut it in the crowded, AI-driven startup era of 2025. Innovation cycles are moving faster than ever, and what used to take several years can now be achieved in just a few months. So Irving and the GTMfund team advise their portfolio companies to differentiate in their distribution rather than their product.\n\n“The aperture for how you build your go-to-market or revenue engine and the decisions you make to get there have never had more unique and specific pathways depending on your company,” Irving said.\n\nIn this episode, Irving dove into several specific examples of what he’s seen work for startups. The main takeaways: AI can help small teams hone their data-driven approach and find direct lines to their customer base through creative means; in the early days, founders can’t tackle all distribution channels at once; hiring should be approached thoughtfully without a traditional mindset; and building a team of trusted advisers should be a top priority.\n\nEarly-stage investors, at least at GTMfund, aren’t looking for startups that have spent half their budget on paid ads or hired a full sales team. They want to see founders get creative with how they reach their unique customers. Irving laid out an example of one startup that became an active participant in several relevant Facebook groups. “If you think about it in the framework of, okay, it’s a thousand people, but 700 of them are my actual ICP and buyer because of the specific groups that either we started as a company or the ones that we’ve become the most active posters in. It can become a really unique channel if you’re looking to bring on 40, 50, 60 new customers in a given year,” he said.\n\nIrving argues that the aperture for going to market has never been broader, so it’s crucial for founders to carve out a creative approach for reaching their target customer. However, founders can’t and shouldn’t do it alone. A refrain throughout this conversation is the importance of a robust network. GTMfund provides their portfolio companies with a vast network of operators, but they won’t just hand founders a Rolodex — they create bespoke pairings to ensure that there will be value in the meeting for everyone involved.\n\n“I think what’s wonderful about the venture-backed ecosystem more generally is people’s willingness to help. They know how hard it is to build a company. They know how low the likelihood of success is in the grand scheme of things, but people are always willing. If you come and you’re curious, you teach them something as part of that as well. People are usually willing to open up doors,” Irving said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either.\n\nExperts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware market for years believe the report is part of an effort and campaign by the company to get the U.S. government to remove the company from a blocklist — technically called the Entity List — as it hopes to enter the U.S. market with new financial backers and executives at the helm.\n\nLast year, a group of U.S. investors acquired the company, and since then, NSO has been undergoing a transition that included high-profile personnel changes: former Trump official David Friedman was appointed the new executive chairman; CEO Yaron Shohat stepped down; and Omri Lavie, the last remaining founder who was still involved in the company, also left, as Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.\n\n“When NSO’s products are in the right hands within the right countries, the world is a far safer place. That will always be our overriding mission,” Friedman wrote in the report, which does not mention any country where NSO operates.\n\nNatalia Krapiva, the senior tech-legal counsel at Access Now, a digital rights organization that investigates spyware abuses, told TechCrunch: “NSO is clearly on a campaign to get removed from the U.S. Entity List and one of the key things they need to show is that they have dramatically changed as a company since they were listed.”\n\n“Changing the leadership is one part and this transparency report is another,” said Krapiva.\n\n“However, we have seen this before with NSO and other spyware companies over the years where they change names and leadership and publish empty transparency or ethics reports but the abuses continue.”\n\nContact Us Do you know more information about NSO Group?

After President Donald Trump took office again last year, NSO intensified these efforts. But, as of May last year, NSO had failed to sway the new administration.\n\nIn late December, the Trump administration lifted sanctions against three executives tied to the Intellexa spyware consortium, in what some saw as a sign of a shift in the administration’s attitude toward spyware makers.\n\nA lack of details\n\nThis year’s transparency report, which covers 2025, has fewer details than reports from previous years.\n\nIn an earlier transparency report covering 2024, for example, NSO said it opened three investigations of potential misuse. Without naming the customers, the company said it cut ties with one, and imposed on another customer “alternative remediation measures,” including mandating human rights training, monitoring the customer activities, and requesting more information about how the customer uses the system. NSO did not provide any information about the third investigation.\n\nNSO also said that during 2024, the company rejected more than $20 million “in new business opportunities due to human rights concerns.”\n\nIn the transparency report published the prior year, covering 2022 and 2023, NSO said it suspended or terminated six government customers, without naming them, and claiming these actions resulted in a revenue loss of $57 million.\n\nIn 2021, NSO said it had “disconnected” the systems of five customers since 2016 following an investigation of misuse, resulting in more than $100 million in “estimated loss of revenue,” and it also said that it “discontinued engagements” with five customers due to “concerns regarding human rights.”\n\nNSO’s newest transparency report does not include the total number of customers NSO has, statistics have been consistently present in previous reports.\n\nTechCrunch asked NSO spokesperson Gil Lanier to provide similar statistics and figures, but did not receive answers by press time.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses for more than a decade, criticized NSO.\n\n“I was expecting information, numbers,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Nothing in this document allows outsiders to verify NSO’s claims, which is business as usual from a company that has a decade long history of making claims that later turned out to be misrepresentation.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:15:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:29:01.766081"}

While others sell you gas, we give you technology to harvest it for free,” founder and CEO Terry Tan said.\n\n​The company claims EverNitro delivers 95% nitrogen purity and highlights its ability to generate nitrogen directly from the surrounding air. By eliminating the need for single-use cartridges, the device provides a less expensive, environmentally friendly solution for home use.\n\nImage Credits:XBREW Lab\n\nAfter testing it ourselves, we were pleasantly surprised. The machine is simple to use, and it fits easily on a counter or stores comfortably on a shelf—making it a nice addition to any kitchen or bar setup. The canister accommodates coffee, cocktails for that bar-quality touch, or other beverages. Users can select their preferred pressure, which ranges from 0 to 8 BAR (a metric unit of pressure).\n\nThe entire process, from loading your beverage to enjoying the finished drink, takes only minutes. There’s also a companion app that delivers updates.\n\nThe device launched on Kickstarter in October and raised over $570,000—a testament to strong interest in this product despite its premium price point. The Lite option costs $470 and includes just the machine and canister, while backers can purchase it for $290. The Pro version is $583 (or $337 for backers) and comes with the machine, two canisters, a coffee bean preservation jar, and whipped cream kits.​ Yet, for comparison’s sake, a countertop unit of NitroBrew costs about $1,000.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The company says that, eventually, it envisions the device “evolving into an ambient-care agent that supports everyday life.”\n\nThe bot was announced during LG’s keynote earlier this week, but it was also available for inspection via rolling presentations on the convention room floor. I went to check one out, where I saw the bot, alongside a human presenter, performing a variety of tasks for an enthusiastic audience.\n\nCLOid has autonomous movement, so it can get around by itself, and comes equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors that, when paired with LG’s smart home ThinQ app, can leverage situational and environmental data to make proactive suggestions for how to make its user’s life better, LG says.\n\nThe bot also has speakers so it can communicate with its user. LG says that CLOid runs off a vision language model that converts “images and video into structured, language-based understanding” and a vision language action program that can convert verbal commands into action (you know, like Siri).\n\nThe last few years have seen the introduction of a number of domestic robots, including Amazon’s Astro and Enabot’s EBO X. CLOid follows in their footsteps but seems designed for a broader array of domestic tasks than its predecessors. Unlike Astro and EBO (which are little more than squat, rolling automatons), CLOid has a large upper body and two arms — a physicality clearly designed to lift stuff and interact with its environment.\n\nYou’d think that would lead to some impressive results, right? Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOid didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

During Tuesday’s presentation, when his human counterpart asked CLOid to make him some breakfast, the robot trundled over to the refrigerator, waited for the automatic door to open, and then stared into the fridge’s depths for an uncomfortably long period of time before ultimately selecting milk.\n\nYes, even the most lethargic human would likely win in a race against CLOid. However, speed isn’t really the issue here. The idea is to make sure that the bot’s human companion doesn’t have to do any work at all. It’s part of what LG refers to as its “Zero Labor Home” model, where automation takes care of all of those boring but essential domestic chores. You can be off brushing your teeth or answering a call from your boss while the bot is in the next room, prepping pancakes. That’s the idea, at least.\n\nFrom the available presentation, it’s a little unclear when that idea will become a reality. I was unable to find out if and when the bot would actually be available to the public. A disclaimer at the bottom of the presentation’s videos read: “Products and solutions shown in this video are under development and not been released for commercial use, thus specifications may vary.”\n\nAn on-site LG communications staffer told me that CLOid would be available in the future, but she didn’t know when. I reached out to LG’s Home Solutions team for more information.\n\nThus, like a lot of other robots on display at CES, CLOid felt a little more like an ad for its company’s potential than an accurate representation of what it is currently offering. The bot also seemed well positioned to help market LG’s new AI home ecosystem, which represents a broader array of impressive smart home products, the bulk of which seem like easier lifts for consumers than a new robot in their home.\n\nI got a brief tour of some of the latest editions of those products. In addition to the return of the LG Wallpaper (having spent a few minutes staring into its insanely thin but beautifully hypnotic surface, I can safely say I want one), the company had a variety of appliances on display this week, including an AI-powered oven that can identify particular ingredients and recommend recipes for you, and an AI refrigerator that you can talk to. All of these devices are supposed to synch with CLOid and are controllable via the company’s ThinQ app.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:04:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:29:02.072379"}

Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down.” But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a new study published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers.\n\nCo-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge. For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.\n\nIn that 2022 study, all the dogs—regardless of whether they were GWL dogs or typical dogs—successfully picked out the target toys in both light and dark conditions, though it took them longer to locate the toys in the dark. Most relied on visual cues, even though dogs possess an excellent sense of smell. However, the dogs sniffed more frequently and longer when searching for the toy in the dark.\n\nThe GWL dogs were also able to select the named toys when commanded by their owners, with similar reliance on visual cues—what the toy looks like—augmented by their sense of smell (what the toy smells like), particularly in dark conditions. This confirmed that when dogs play with a toy, they record its features using multiple senses, creating a “multistory mental image.” They prefer to rely primarily on visual cues, but dogs can incorporate other sensory cues, most notably smell, when the conditions call for it.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:00:07 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:29:02.956180"}
{"title": "Best Bird Feeders With Cameras, Tested and Reviewed (2026)", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-bird-feeders/", "summary": "These bird feeders come with cameras and connected apps to let you see and learn about the birds in your neighborhood.", "content": "you’ve probably seen a smart bird feeder or know someone who has one. They’re fairly recognizable from a distance with their clear housing, cameras, and solar panels, and perhaps a friend or family member has sent you a photo or video of a bright goldfinch or handsome woodpecker (guilty). The question at this point, then, is whether these things are really worth the $100-plus price tag. Are they actually durable? And what about the squirrel problem?\n\nLucky for you, we’ve been testing the most popular smart bird feeder models, including Netvue’s original Birdfy Lite feeder ($140) and Birdbuddy's Pro ($179), for over a year—in rain, snow, and heat, and in a yard with persistent squirrels. We’ve explored the apps and notification settings, examined the photo and video quality, noted which features are hidden behind a subscription paywall, and used Cornell Lab’s All About Birds—as well as Google Lens and our own local expertise—to verify the accuracy of AI identifications.\n\nUpdated January 2026: I’ve added the solar-roof version of Kiwibit's Beako as a new pick and new testing notes for both Birdbuddys, added a feeder from Detiko to Others Tested, and ensured up-to-date links and prices. Next up is the Coolfly Aura, a feeder with a unique modular camera system, which debuted at CES this week.\n\nBest Overall\n\nThis cheery blue- or yellow-roofed feeder, from security company Netvue, is the first smart feeder WIRED tested, back in 2022. At that time, we gave it a 6/10 rating for its high price and wonky AI. Both metrics have improved dramatically since then—Birdfy's app is now the second-most user-friendly on the market, behind only Birdbuddy, and this feeder is often on sale for $150 or less. If you pay $20 more, you get a lifetime subscription for AI identification, which is a solid deal, especially since the AI's success rate is fairly decent. Without it, it'll cost you $5 a month, but it's not required to get plenty of enjoyment. This is the feeder I bought my elderly parents for Christmas during an Amazon Prime Day sale for its reliability, easy setup, and easy-to-navigate app, and it's still going strong two years later.\n\nThe 1080p camera has one of the widest viewing angles of any smart feeder, at 155 degrees, and it offers color night vision. The IP65 plastic construction also makes this feeder durable and easier to clean, and the 50-ounce seed reservoir is super easy to fill with its convenient flip-up top. Not all bundles come with a solar panel, but you can buy it separately. Unlike other feeders, the solar panel is not built in and will have to be mounted and connected separately with the included 9.8-foot charging cable. (The Birdfy can be mounted on a pole, wall, or tree, though if you mount it on a pole using the 5-7-9 siting rule, you won't be able to mount the solar panel.)\n\nBest Upgrade\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nKiwibit via Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Kiwibit Beako (With Solar Roof) $270 Amazon $280 $220 (21% off) Kiwibit WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Thoughtful engineering makes for easy maintenance\n\nSolar panel works great in all weather\n\nVery sturdy construction\n\n8 MP photos and 4K HD video TIRED Pricey for a smart feeder and rarely on sale\n\nOnly works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi\n\nRequires a subscription for all features\n\nThis Beako model is not only one of the most thoughtfully designed feeders on the market, it's also what I use in my own yard when I'm not testing feeders for work. The 1.5L dual-hopper plastic seed reservoir is removable from the body for refilling, so you don't have to take the whole feeder down; the 8 MP photos and 4K HD video are much better quality than you'll find from most competitors; and the components come apart for easy cleaning. I also tested the original version with a separate solar panel, and my only complaint was that the panel stopped charging the camera after about six weeks. There’s now a version with a built-in solar roof, which has done an excellent job keeping things charged during its six-week-long test, even in cloudy weather. The IP65 plastic body is extremely thick and sturdy, and unlike lighter-weight models, it's designed to hold up in more extreme weather.\n\nThe app is easy to navigate, and the whole setup is fully functional without a Kiwibit Plus subscription ($4/month or $47/year, purchasable through the Kiwibit app)—it even includes AI identification as a base feature, and it's pretty decent. However, Kiwibit Plus is necessary to access all features, mainly extended 60-day storage and the ability to record up to three minutes of video if a bird is doing something interesting, which is a unique feature among smart feeders and one I discovered I love. (Nothing more frustrating than having a video cut off right as a bird is about to do something funny.) If you’ve tried other smart feeders and found them lacking, this one costs a bit more for what it is, and it's almost never on sale, but if you know you like having a smart feeder, I think it's worth the investment. Note, however, that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the warranty is half the length you get from competitors.\n\nBest Connectivity\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVideo: Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Camojojo Hibird Pro $170 Amazon WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Runs on 2.4 5 GHz and 5 GHz\n\n4K Ultra HD video\n\nSolar panel stays charged even in cloudy weather TIRED Heavier than most smart feeders\n\nAI is still just OK\n\nSubscription now required for all features\n\nCamojojo's original Hibird feeder has long been a reliable model in my testing stable, unique for its ability to run on both 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands—almost all smart feeders are 2.4 GHz only—and this year saw the debut of an upgraded model, the Hibird Pro. This one has built-in solar panels, an option for pole mounting, and supposedly improved AI identification, though it still frequently misidentifies even common birds in my West Coast backyard as East Coast species. The app is not as streamlined or user-friendly as Birdfy's or Birdbuddy's, but it's still easy enough to navigate, with options for changing video length (default is 10 seconds) or viewing in slo-mo. Video is the default media type it saves, though this is 4K Ultra HD. Without a subscription, you can't search past videos by bird, and cloud storage is capped at 5 GB over 60 days, though the feeder does come with a 128-GB SD card. You'll also get “smarter” chats with the app's AI Q&A function, “Dr. Bird,” and the ability to share across two devices ($45 year/$4 month).\n\nI appreciate the generous 1.5L seed hopper, though this, combined with the solar panel and battery, makes this one heavy feeder. When filled, it tips the scales at 5 pounds, so if you do pole mount, you will need to use both included hose clamps. I also wouldn't attempt to mount it on anything unstable. Other Hibird features transferred to the Pro are the assembly screws having little handles on them, so you won't need a screwdriver, and a chunky IP66 plastic body. It was subjected to a little bit of squirrel chewing during my test, but still held up well.\n\nBest Smart Hummingbird Feeder\n\nBirdbuddy is known for its user-friendliness and thoughtful and fun app, and its new Pro Smart Hummingbird Feeder is no exception. Everything about its use is intuitive and easy. AI identification, 5 MP photos, 2K HD video with slo-mo—everything you need is included out of the box. A subscription is optional to unlock features like family sharing and a higher bit rate, but the feeder is perfectly usable without it. There’s also no auxiliary solar panel to worry about, as it’s built into the roof. Pairing with your phone is a cinch, integrating it into the Birdbuddy app with other feeders is a snap, and even filling it is no problem—unlike other hummingbird feeders that have weirdly cavernous capacities and/or need to be filled upside down, the Birdbuddy’s bottom screws off and holds a reasonable 1.75 cups of liquid. This is more important than you’d think, as Cornell Lab of Ornithology points out that the easier it is to clean a hummingbird feeder, the more likely you are to do it often and well.\n\nIt also comes with extra plastic flowers and a little brush to clean them with, and the app sends reminders as to when it's time to clean. You'll also find fun, seasonal touches in the app, like the ability to send digital bird holiday cards with your pics, or a tool to superimpose hats, clothes, and various accessories on the birds, which is actually funnier than it sounds. However, as with the Birdbuddy Pro seed feeder, below, the big downside is that the feeder's sensor doesn’t always pick up every bird that visits, which can definitely be a bummer when you see something interesting out the window but it doesn’t show up in the app.\n\nA Unique Smart Birdhouse\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Birdfy Nest Polygon Smart Birdhouse $280 $210 (25% off) Birdfy $390 $200 (49% off) Walmart WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED User-friendly app that compiles shareable “stories”\n\nNo subscription needed to use\n\nRemote control allows troubleshooting without disturbing birds\n\nInterchangeable hole sizes to attract different bird species TIRED Some connectivity issues\n\nOur test model attracted no birds\n\nVarnished interior and large cavity size may be off-putting, and audible camera click when going live could scare curious visitors\n\nBirdfy’s Polygon Smart Birdhouse isn’t the first smart birdhouse on the market, but it is the most interesting-looking. The parallelogram-esque, turquoise-paneled shape won a Gold award at 2024’s French Design Awards, and it’s easy enough to mount on a pole, fence, or tree. All the camera equipment is located in an easy-to-open rear hatch, and there’s even a remote control at the end of a 10-foot cord to be able to charge (though it has a built-in solar panel, so you likely won’t need to) or reset the 1080p camera.\n\nIt's simple to integrate with the easy-to-use Birdfy app, which is ready and waiting to assemble a bird's shareable “story,” from assembly of the nest to hatching to fledgling, and finally “the end,” when the nest is abandoned for the season. Note that the camera does emit an audible click whenever it's triggered by movement or the app, and the inside is a little larger than most birds would naturally gravitate to, though I did like that it comes with interchangeable hole sizes to interest different species. We did have a few assorted connectivity issues, and our test house didn't attract any visitors this year, but a project director for Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s NestWatch said it should only be a matter of time.\n\nBest App\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nScreenshot courtesy of Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Birdbuddy Smart Bird Feeder Pro $299 $239 (20% off) Amazon $299 Huckberry WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Fun and feature-rich app\n\nBuilt-in solar panel works great TIRED Camera doesn't always capture all birds\n\nBirdbuddy's Pro model sports a snazzy new HDR camera that can also shoot 2K HD video with slow-motion capability. In addition to having a visibly larger and more advanced lens, the camera's now got a larger focus range, 122-degree field of view, and high-fidelity microphone. (A subscription to Birdbuddy Premium for $70 a year unlocks 2K Ultra with a higher video bit rate, allowing for richer colors, sharper images, and less background noise—plus the ability to set alerts for sick or injured birds, among other things—but it's perfectly usable without this. )\n\nThe photos aren't nearly as impressive as those by competitors like the Birdfy Pro Duo, Camojojo Hibird, or Kiwibit Beako, and the camera, frustratingly, only captures a handful of the birds that visit. (The non-solar version is occasionally flagged as a frequently returned item on Amazon due to both this and charging issues, so I recommend the solar version.) However, Birdbuddy's app is a consistent standout, with a user-friendly design and plenty of helpful alerts, like if a cat is detected nearby, or if it's time to clean the feeder.\n\nIt also serves you insights gathered over time, like what time certain species seem to prefer to visit. (Finches apparently like to visit my yard at 10 am daily.) The Birdbuddy also “sleeps” at night and does not seem to emphasize capturing photos of people, so it wouldn't make a good choice to double as a security camera, and there are also unique seasonal features like the ability to send holiday cards or “dress up” visiting birds with hats, glasses, and sweaters. (It is funnier than it sounds, really!) Both Birdbuddys work with 2.4-GHz Wi-Fi only.\n\nAnother Birdbuddy downside is the infuriatingly small, hinged opening for filling the 4 cups' worth of seed. The feeder comes with its own spouted cup, but I have yet to fill the feeder without making an enormous mess. I also tested the 3-in-1 Nutrition Set ($39), which includes a screw-on tray that can variably become a water fountain, jelly dish, or fruit stake for fruit-loving species like orioles. I've used it as a jelly dish and water fountain and found that it blocks enough of the perch area that birds tend to shift out of camera view to avoid it. However, this feeder is still worth it for those who like a more streamlined app experience and/or want to take advantage of some of its unique sharing features, especially Premium's ability to share your feeder livestream with others.\n\nIf You Want to Use an Existing Bird Feeder\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Camojojo Hibird DIY $135 Amazon (With Solar) WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Flexible design allows you to use an existing bird feeder\n\nHigh-quality photo and video\n\nWorks with 5 GHz Wi-Fi TIRED Only has 90-degree field of view\n\nOnly comes with a wall mount\n\nSolar panel has to be mounted separately\n\nIf you have an existing bird feeder you like, or are interested in building your own and are just looking for a camera, Hibird's stand-alone DIY feeder camera is for you. It's compatible with both 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands—a rarity for bird feeder cameras—and the cute green owl face streams the same 4K HD video and 1080p pics as the bigger Hibird feeder, above. There is a subscription tier with features like increased storage, but the camera is still usable without it. There's an auxiliary solar panel included for charging, and you can mount it via its ¼-inch nut on the included bendable arm and bracket, or jury-rig a custom solution. It pairs seamlessly with the Hibird app, with access to AI (which is just OK), livestreaming, and the Dr. Bird ChatGPT-like feature, where you can ask bird-related questions. (The answers are corny and not as granular as they could be, but it still could be useful for some.)\n\nA Truly Squirrel-Proof Design\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVideo: Kat Merck Chevron Chevron TT Nature Squirrel-Proof Metal Bird Feeder $80 Amazon $130 TT Nature WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Design really deters squirrels\n\nCan be pole-mounted TIRED Design also deters larger and even medium-sized birds\n\nApp is not user-friendly and requires a subscription\n\nSolar panel must be mounted separately\n\nLet's get the bad news out of the way first—the app for this feeder is not good. Not only is it suspiciously called “Birdty,\" it's not intuitive to navigate and requires a subscription to access all features—including AI identification, which is terrible. I have also seen this feeder body (TT Nature offers it in green or red) sold from time to time under other Amazon insignias, so it's not unique to this brand. However, those usually have solar panels attached to the roofs, from which squirrels can hang upside down to avoid tripping the spring-loaded perch. This one leaves off the panel (there is one that can be mounted separately, but it's not possible when the feeder is pole-mounted, which is what I recommend), but it doesn't need it, as the charge from the 5,200-mAh battery lasts well over a month.\n\nI had my test unit sited on a pole with a baffle far from fences and overhanging branches, and though an occasional squirrel would still manage to find the feeder, the spring-loaded perch mechanism worked as intended—a squirrel tries to sit, and a bar flips up to block access to the seed. (There's also a squirrel alarm feature that can be toggled on and off in the app, but in my experience, those never work.) I have seen squirrels try to chew through the sides, but given that the body is metal, their efforts are fruitless.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:33:19 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T19:44:45.736875"}

He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.\n\nCES is always jam-packed with new laptop announcements, acting as a barometer for the year’s upcoming releases. The proofs of concept at the show display what could potentially come further in the future. 2026 will soon bring us new chip options from Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. While I’m excited to see how the latest horse race shakes out, some of the new designs and form factors displayed at the show are easily more compelling.\n\nThere was a myriad of new models shown from Asus, Lenovo, Dell, MSI, Acer, and HP. Here’s my shortlist of all the ones I’m most looking forward to testing — or hoping that there will even be an opportunity to test in the future.\n\nAsus ROG Zephyrus Duo\n\nI love OLEDs and I enjoy a good gaming laptop. The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo is a gaming laptop based on the excellent Zephyrus G16, but with two full-size OLED displays. Sign me up.\n\nThe original Zephyrus Duo was a strange experiment for a laptop with two screens. The lower display was a decently sized strip across the bottom, but now for 2026 the second screen is the whole dang bottom half of the laptop like it should have always been. Asus basically took the dual-screen design it established a couple years ago with the productivity-focused Zenbook Duo and translated it into a Zephyrus gaming laptop. It’s going to make tradeoffs, because the new Zephyrus Duo is likely going to cost more than the standard Zephyrus G16 while not being as powerful, but in exchange you get two 16-inch OLEDs with a 120Hz refresh rate for a multi-monitor setup you can take on the go.\n\nThe 2026 Zephyrus Duo looks very promising as a combination gaming laptop and power-user-friendly multiscreen workhorse. There’s really nothing else quite like it. Now let’s cross our fingers that this unique laptop doesn’t get a uniquely high price to match.\n\nLenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept\n\nI was instantly a fan of rollable laptops when I got to see Lenovo’s concept become a reality at last year’s CES, and its usefulness was proven once I reviewed it. But I, and I wager many of you, wondered if a laptop screen that extended horizontally might be even better. Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept proves there’s something to that, as I couldn’t help smiling once I saw this gaming laptop extend from 16 inches to an ultrawide 24 inches before my eyes.\n\nThis concept was still rough around the edges, with noisy motors that occasionally stuttered, resolution that didn’t adjust to the screen’s changing size, and a massive panel gap in the lid. But if all that gets ironed away, and I expect that it will if it ever comes out, this could be my ideal gaming laptop. You get the immersion and multitasking benefits of an ultrawide monitor on demand, and you get to tuck it away and take it with you. It’s unlike anything else, and I’m really rooting for it to make it past the proof-of-concept stage. I want another moment like last year where we get to say, “and you can own this if you’d like.” I still do shudder to think what it may cost, though.\n\nAcer Swift 16 AI\n\nYou can land a plane on that trackpad.\n\nI wasn’t fond of haptic trackpads and their simulated clicks when Apple started putting them in MacBooks around 10 years ago, but at some point I came around to them and the ability to click anywhere on their surface from corner to corner. Now, Acer’s new Swift 16 AI has the largest haptic trackpad around, complete with stylus support, and it’s instantly one of Acer’s most interesting offerings at CES because of it.\n\nWe don’t know how much the Acer Swift 16 AI will cost (an unfortunate trend for some laptop companies at CES 2026), but I’m intrigued to see where this model in particular lands. That football field of a haptic trackpad, combined with a generous port selection (which the Swifts are typically known for) and an OLED display, has a lot of potential if the price is right.\n\nDell XPS 14 / 16\n\nXPS is so back, it took over the lid.\n\nI’m so relieved that Dell caved to the pressure from last year and resurrected the XPS line. I don’t want to give too much credit, as I found many faults in the last XPS model I tested. But things already look much more promising in the new XPS 14 and 16 (they even have nice new lid logos). The physical function row is back, the seamless haptic trackpad now has some nice etched lines to inform you of its boundaries, and these machines are freaking thin. The thinness makes me a little nervous, as there have been many XPS laptops in the past that struggled with heat, but we’ll have to see when the time comes for testing.\n\nThe new XPS models also have a unique feature: variable refresh rate screens that go as high as 120Hz and as low as just 1Hz. That’s the kind of tech that has helped phone screens remain buttery smooth during scrolling while saving battery life when viewing static elements like a document. And this feature will be on the base-model XPS 14 and 16 with lowly IPS displays, as well as fancier configurations with bright tandem OLEDs. I’m tempering my expectations, especially since there are no discrete GPU options like previous XPS generations, but much of this XPS resurgence looks good.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad Rollable XD concept\n\nRollable + seethrough = ❤️.\n\nIt’s another rollable Lenovo concept, yes, but a ThinkPad with a rollable screen is a big deal. This is Lenovo’s bread-and-butter business laptop line, and the concept here isn’t to reinvent the wheel but to potentially augment its offerings. That flexible OLED screen you see there, wrapping around its own lid, extends upward from a standard 13.3 inches to an extra-tall 15.9 inches.\n\nI agree with commenters that the exposed screen on the outside could make a workhorse laptop feel much more fragile, even with something as simple as throwing it into your bag. But the exciting thing here is that Lenovo continues to tinker with how it can deliver the rollable form factor. Since the ThinkPad Rollable XD keeps the motors and flexible OLED contained in the lid, it could one day be offered as a display configuration for regular ThinkPads. Anything that means rollable form factors could become more common (and ideally, cheaper) sounds good in my book. And that seethrough lid that shows the mechanics of the extendable screen at work? Chef’s kiss!\n\nAsus Zenbook A16\n\nTreat yourself to 16 inches of Asus.\n\nIt’s likely obvious to you that I love big displays, and at 2.65 pounds the Asus Zenbook A16 is one of the lightest 16-inchers around. It’s also got another thing that’s near and dear to my heart: a full-size SD card reader. That’s a rare find these days in thin-and-light devices, and it makes the life of a photographer like me much easier.\n\nBut there are other compelling factors to the A16 other than my personal love for card slots: It’s got an OLED with 2880 x 1800 resolution and 120Hz refresh, a solid selection of ports, and it can be configured with Qualcomm’s highest-end Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip. I imagine that’s going to be a pricey spec, but it could be worth it for someone in need of a big Windows laptop that doesn’t feel big — and one that should have equally large-and-in-charge battery life.\n\nMSI Stealth 16\n\nStealthBook Pro.\n\nMSI really shook things up in the looks department this year for its non-gaming laptops. The new Prestige models look like something you wouldn’t be embarrassed to bring to an office, and they’re really quite sleek overall. The refined design of the new Stealth 16 creator / softcore gaming laptop also looks great (even if it could stand to be just a little stealthier). It’s got some wannabe MacBook Pro vibes, but it offers plenty of ports (including ethernet). It also comes standard with a 240Hz OLED display, Intel’s new Panther Lake chips, and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs. Last year I tested the absolutely over-the-top MSI Titan, and I’m eager to review something from MSI that’s more subdued than its usually garish gaming laptops.\n\nAsus TUF Gaming A14\n\nYou a TUF guy?\n\nAsus’ TUF line is the lower-cost rung of its gaming laptop offerings. They’re designed to be as cheap as you can get an Asus laptop with a discrete Nvidia GPU. But there’s a new TUF A14 coming with AMD Strix Halo — yes, integrated graphics. And it looks very intriguing.\n\nLast year’s Asus ROG Flow Z13 proved that integrated graphics can be great. Now in 2026, we’ll see a TUF with integrated graphics in a fairly compact chassis. Ideally, it should be an affordable (well, affordable-ish) gaming laptop that’s also good at other laptop-y things like battery life. But Strix Halo is not known for being an affordable chip. Maybe the new versions AMD is making will help, but we’ll have to hope Asus is able to land on a price that makes sense for this little guy.\n\nHP Eliteboard G1a\n\nThe Eliteboard G1a “keyputer” is essentially a headless laptop put into an unassuming HP keyboard. I was so ready to write it off as just a fun oddity for boring suits and IT folks — even if it does sort of harken back to the olden days of the Commodore 64. But I’ll level with you guys: I have no idea why our silly little video on this thing absolutely blew up on social media. (Is it my shirt? Tell me it’s my shirt.)\n\nShould I review the Eliteboard once it’s available? Something tells me I’ve already answered my question as I type this.\n\nPhotography by Antonio G.

Apple and Google have removed other “nudify” apps—but continue to host X and Grok.", "content": "Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is being used to flood X with thousands of sexualized images of adults and apparent minors wearing minimal clothing. Some of this content appears to not only violate X’s own policies, which prohibit sharing illegal content such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), but may also violate the guidelines of Apple’s App Store and the Google Play store.\n\nApple and Google both explicitly ban apps containing CSAM, which is illegal to host and distribute in many countries. The tech giants also forbid apps that contain pornographic material or facilitate harassment. The Apple App Store says it doesn’t allow “overtly sexual or pornographic material,” as well as “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content,” especially if the app is “likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group.” The Google Play store bans apps that “contain or promote content associated with sexually predatory behavior, or distribute non-consensual sexual content,” and well as programs that “contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or bullying.”\n\nOver the past two years, Apple and Google removed a number of “nudify” and AI image-generation apps after investigations by the BBC and 404 Media found they were being advertised or used to effectively turn ordinary photos into explicit images of women without their consent.\n\nBut at the time of publication, both the X app and the standalone Grok app remain available in both app stores. Apple, Google, and X did not respond to requests for comment. Grok is operated by Musk’s multibillion-dollar artificial intelligence startup xAI, which also did not respond to questions from WIRED. In a public statement published on January 3, X said that it takes action against illegal content on its platform, including CSAM. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the company warned.\n\nSloan Thompson, the director of training and education at EndTAB, a group that teaches organizations how to prevent the spread of nonconsensual sexual content, says it is “absolutely appropriate” for companies like Apple and Google to take action against X and Grok.\n\nThe amount of nonconsensual explicit images on X generated by Grok has exploded over the past two weeks. One researcher told Bloomberg that over a 24-hour period between January 5 and 6, Grok was producing roughly 6,700 images every hour they identified as “sexually suggestive or nudifying.” Another analyst collected more than 15,000 URLs of images that Grok created on X during a two-hour period on December 31. WIRED reviewed approximately one-third of the images, and found that many of them featured women dressed in revealing clothing. Over 2,500 were marked as no longer available within a week, while almost 500 were labeled as \"age-restricted adult content.\"\n\nEarlier this week, a spokesperson for the European Commission, the governing body of the European Union, publicly condemned the sexually explicit and non-consensual images being generated by Grok on X as “illegal” and “appalling,” telling Reuters that such content “has no place in Europe.”\n\nOn Thursday, the EU ordered X to retain all internal documents and data relating to Grok until the end of 2026, extending a prior retention directive, to ensure authorities can access materials relevant to compliance with the EU’s Digital Services Act, though a new formal investigation has yet to be announced. Regulators in other countries, including the UK, India, and Malaysia have also said they are investigating the social media platform.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:25:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T20:35:15.399129"}
{"title": "MAGA Is Already Rewriting the ICE Shooting in Minneapolis", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/maga-trump-rewriting-ice-shooting-minneapolis/", "summary": "The sanctioned government narrative of the Minneapolis shooting diverts wildly from video footage of the incident shared online.", "content": "Trump administration officials and MAGA world are attempting to rewrite the shooting in Minneapolis.\n\nThe shooting took place on Wednesday morning when several masked agents—later identified by Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin as members of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency—approached a vehicle. Video footage shared on social media appears to show a masked agent ask the driver to get out of the vehicle before grabbing the door handle. At this point, the driver appears to reverse, before driving forward and turning. A third masked federal officer, standing near the front of the vehicle, pulls out a gun and fires at the vehicle, killing Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman.\n\nThe masked officer who fired at the vehicle was identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune as ICE agent Jonathan Ross. McLaughlin did not immediately respond to an email asking if DHS could confirm the Star Tribune’s reporting.\n\nAlmost immediately, federal government officials portrayed Good as the perpetrator. Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called Good’s actions an act of “domestic terrorism,” adding that the victim had “weaponized her vehicle” and that the agent involved had simply “followed his training.” Later on Wednesday in a Truth Social post, president Donald Trump wrote that Good had “viciously” run over the agent while blaming the “radical left.” In a press conference on Thursday morning, Noem doubled down, once again calling Good a “domestic terrorist,” while falsely claiming the agents involved were “surrounded and assaulted and blocked in by protesters.” On Thursday, vice president JD Vance claimed Good was “a victim of left-wing ideology” and that she had “[thrown] their car in front of ICE officers,” adding, “You've got to be a little brainwashed.\"\n\nThe administration’s effort to immediately spin the narrative, and deflect the blame from the agents Trump has empowered to target communities across the country, is something the current administration has done repeatedly. This case, however, is arguably one of the more egregious examples thus far, given how wildly the sanctioned government narrative diverts from the reality shown in video footage of the incident shared online.\n\nMAGA world influencers very quickly fell in line. Trump’s decision to blame the “radical left” was echoed by his loudest supporters online, some of whom predicted mass violence from the left as a result of the incident.\n\n“She was trying to stage an illegal blockade of the road to interfere with ICE agents and then rammed her car into one of them when they attempted to apprehend her,” podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X, in a post viewed nearly 700,000 times. “This isn’t even a close call. Entirely justified. She is 100 percent to blame for her own death.”\n\nVideo footage of the incident appears to directly contradict Walsh’s claim that Good “rammed her car” into the agent who shot her through the windshield and the driver’s window. Local politicians also disputed this claim: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called the administration’s version of events “bullshit” and a \"garbage narrative.” Frey also said ICE should “get the fuck out of Minneapolis.” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz also rejected the government’s narrative, instead blaming Trump’s policies which, he said, are “designed to generate fear, headlines, and conflict … Today that recklessness cost someone their life.\"\n\nThat didn’t deter other influencers and content creators, however. “The Minneapolis ICE shooting can now be 100% confirmed to be self defense from this new video,” Robby Starbuck, a visiting fellow with the hugely-influential Heritage Foundation, wrote on X. “The deceased anti-ICE driver clearly HIT the ICE agent that opened fire with her car. This is textbook self defense.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:17:12 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T20:35:15.629525"}

Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins unveiled the delayed 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for America Wednesday, which is already drawing criticism for its ties to the meat and dairy industry.\n\nHeadlining with the advice to “eat real food,” the new guidelines, which are updated every five years, are in a brisk, citation-free 10-page document. Overall, the new guidelines: lambaste added sugars and highly processed foods (though it doesn’t clearly define them); ditch previous limits on alcohol while directing Americans to just drink “less”; beef up recommendations for protein, including red meat; and appear to embrace saturated fats while not actually changing the 2020–2025 recommendation for how much you should eat—which was and continues to be no more than 10 percent of total daily calories.\n\n“We are ending the war on saturated fats,” Kennedy said triumphantly in a White House press briefing Wednesday, despite the lack of a change. He went on to proclaim that “today, our government declares war on added sugar,” though that too is questionable.\n\nThis is war?\n\nWhile the new guidelines say “no amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is recommended,” it offers the suggestion that “one meal should contain no more than 10 grams of added sugars.” There are four calories in one gram of sugar, so the recommendation means no more than 40 calories from sugar per meal. For three meals a day, that’s a max of 120 calories from sugar a day, which on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, would be about 6 percent of total calories.

And while we haven’t yet seen large, widespread price increases for memory-dependent products like pre-built laptop PCs, smartphones, and graphics cards, most companies expect that to change this year if shortages continue.\n\nIn the meantime, memory manufacturers are riding high demand and high prices to record profits.\n\nIn revenue guidance released this week, Samsung Electronics predicts it will make between 19.9 and 20.1 trillion Korean won in operating profit (roughly $13.8 billion USD) in Q4 2025, compared to just 6.49 trillion won in Q4 of 2024.\n\nSamsung is way more than just a memory business, of course, but its fortunes often rise and fall along with its memory division; Samsung’s profits were dropping dramatically in 2023 partly because of an oversupply of memory that made its memory division lose billions of dollars.\n\nLess-diversified companies that primarily make memory are also raking in money lately. SK Hynix posted its “highest-ever quarterly performance” in Q3 of 2025 with 11.38 trillion Korean won (about $7.8 billion) in operating profit, up from 7.03 trillion in Q3 of 2024, and an operating margin that increased from 40 percent to 47 percent. SK Hynix credits “expanding investments in AI infrastructure” and “surging demand for AI servers” for its performance.\n\nMicron—which recently decided to exit the consumer RAM and storage markets but is still selling its products to other businesses—also reported a big boost to net income year over year, from $1.87 billion in Q1 2025 to $5.24 billion in Q1 2026. This has generated the company’s “highest ever free cash flow.”\n\n“Total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, as well as HBM and data center revenue and revenue in each of our business units, also reached new records [in fiscal Q1],” wrote Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.\n\nWhy is RAM so expensive right now?\n\nReading these upbeat earnings reports and forecasts will be cold comfort to people trying to build or upgrade a PC, who have seen the price of a 32GB kit of DDR5-6000 increase from $80 in August 2025 to $340 today.

I’m reporting this week from the sprawling event, surrounded by fancy, strange, and often unnecessary gadgets, and despite my sore legs, I’ve barely scratched the surface.\n\nThere are at least 900 Chinese tech companies attending CES this year, almost a quarter of the total exhibitors, according to an analysis of the conference’s exhibitor directory. I even saw two Chinese humanoid robots at different booths dancing to the same viral Chinese rap song five minutes apart.\n\nBut at CES, Chinese companies are showing off far more than just gadgets; also on display are artificial intelligence software, electric vehicles, self-driving technology, and more. Today, I’m sharing the four most important trends I’ve seen at CES, from the rise of Chinese smart glasses to the quiet adoption of generative AI video tools.\n\nSeeing Is Believing\n\nMeta has sold over 2 million pairs of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, but the tech giant just announced it’s delaying their global rollout. Chinese AI companies, meanwhile, are taking the product category into overdrive. At CES, there are at least three dozen Chinese AI eyewear products on display this year.\n\nOne of the most promising brands in this space is Rokid, a Hangzhou-based company that has been making VR and AR glasses since 2018. AR glasses are particularly promising, because they are one of the least invasive gadgets to wear for long periods of time, says Zoro Shao, Rokid’s global general manager. Shao says the ideal pair should weigh less than 50 grams, have full-color display, need to be charged only once a day, and retail for less than $500.\n\nBut Shao says smart glasses are still fairly niche, and mass adoption remains far away. “Chinese electric vehicles became unstoppable once they accounted for 5 percent of the total car market in China; now they’re almost 50 percent of the market,” Shao says. Cumulative sales of Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses, in contrast, represent less than 1 percent of the US population.\n\nI tried out Rokid’s flagship glasses, which project a tiny screen in the center of your field of vision that can display GPS directions, AI chatbot conversations, language translations, and a teleprompter. For now, everything is displayed in a single color—green. I was impressed how the glasses could be adapted to my eyesight (I’m quite nearsighted, and smart goggles are usually a pain for me to try). You can insert a pair of prescription lenses into Rokid’s glasses, a process that only took a few seconds. They also have a real-time translation tool, which records the other speaker’s voice, runs it through AI models from Alibaba or Microsoft, and then presents the translation in real time on the same tiny screen. It worked surprisingly well when I tested it, but it’s still awkward to be reading text on a screen when there’s a human standing there talking directly to you.\n\nSpeaking of Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant was also at CES showing off its own new smart glasses, which were released in November. But it had a tiny booth on the edge of one exhibition hall, and the only employee who had the glasses wasn't there when I arrived. Alibaba declined to tell me how well the glasses are selling, but a company representative says it plans to offer them outside of China soon.\n\nI also spoke with a Chinese company called Appotronics, which makes the tiny laser projectors that enable on-lens displays in smart glasses. The smallest model they showed me is about the size of a Lego brick, can display full color on the lenses, and is inexpensive to manufacture.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:25:40 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T21:31:13.384505"}

The FCC will also consider authorizing higher power levels for certain wireless devices that are only allowed to operate indoors.\n\nThe FCC said it scheduled a vote for its January 29 meeting on an order “to create a new category of unlicensed devices… that can operate outdoors and at higher power than previously authorized devices.” These so-called Geofenced variable power (GVP) devices operating on the 6 GHz band will “support high data rates suitable for AR/VR, short-range hotspots, automation, and indoor navigation,” and “overcome limitations of previous device classes by allowing higher power and outdoor mobility,” the FCC said.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nTron: Ares\n\nWhen the original Tron arrived in theaters in 1982, 8-bit video games still seemed futuristic. In this latest entry in the sci-fi series, the world is forced to come face to face with a sophisticated new form of AI, which happens to look a lot like Jared Leto. Ares (yes, Leto) is the embodiment of a game-changing AI program that has been sent into the real world under the guidance of creating a new kind of peace. In truth, Ares has been sent by a villainous tech CEO (played by Evan Peters) to steal the “Permanence Code” created by original Tron character Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), so that digital beings can infiltrate reality permanently. While it’s full of action and impressive CGI, it glances over a lot of the real concerns around AI’s infiltration into everyday life.\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour - The Final Show\n\nOver the course of 21 months—with a tour featuring 149 shows in 51 cities across five continents—an estimated 10 million people got to witness Taylor Swift’s iconic Eras Tour in person. But on December 8, 2024, only 60,000 people got to see her very last performance at Vancouver’s BC Place stadium, where Swift pulled out all the stops and even added a whole new set from that year’s The Tortured Poets Department album. Now, Swifties around the world can witness it, too, with this nearly three-and-a-half-hour rockumentary that puts you in the center of it all.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nIndiana Jones is back! After the original four films in the swashbuckling movie series left the streamer in October when their license expired, all those boring legalities have been settled and fans can once again binge all of Harrison Ford’s archaeological adventures. We suggest kicking it off with the the movie that started it all (and for our money is still the best). Set in 1936, Raiders of the Lost Ark sees our whip-wielding hero (Ford) traveling the world and going to death-defying lengths to ensure that he recovers the storied Ark of the Covenant—a long-lost relic that has the power to make an army invincible—before fellow archaeologist René Belloq (Paul Freeman) does so on behalf of Nazi German forces.\n\nMadame Web\n\nOK, we’re not going to sugarcoat it: As far as MCU movies go, Madame Web is one of the series’ worst (it currently holds an 10 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes). It’s impossible to deny that some of the creative decisions made were very bad ones—so much so that even star Dakota Johnson has publicly voiced her disappointment in the project. But the movie has also got a handful of things going for it: namely, the always-captivating Johnson in the title role. (Plus Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, and Adam Scott.) While the execution is far from perfect, it does offer a fresh take on a superhero origin story. In this case, New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb’s (Johnson) newfound ability to see the future—and change it.\n\nLove+War\n\nAt a time when the business of news is changing, and journalists are coming under fire from high-ranking political figures, Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario is a testament to the importance of a free press. For more than 20 years, Addario has been traveling the world to capture the realities of war and humanitarian crises for outlets like The New York Times and National Geographic. It’s a difficult job, and a dangerous one (she’s been kidnapped twice). But back home, Addario is a wife and mother of two who struggles daily with the sacrifices it takes to juggle the personal and the professional. In an industry dominated by men, Addario has made her mark—and this Nat Geo documentary offers a powerful look at exactly how she has accomplished it all.\n\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\n\nIs the third time really the charm? In the case of the Fantastic Four, the answer is a resounding yes. Following two previous, and largely disastrous, attempts to bring the superhero quartet to the big screen—first when Tim Story did it in 2005, then when Josh Trank tried in 2015—Marvel seems to have figured out the formula for making their so-called “First Family” stick. The film stays true to the original comics with its period 1960s setting and finds astronauts Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn) navigating the challenges of becoming both celebrities and superheroes after cosmic ray exposure gifted them with superhuman abilities. Just as the world starts finally feeling normal again, and Reed and Sue prepare to welcome their first child, the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) descends and announces that Earth is set to be destroyed. It’s a typical comic book movie setup that is elevated by both the newness of these characters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the likability of the actors playing them. A second film is already in development, but we’ll see the foursome pop up in December’s Avengers: Doomsday, too.\n\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes\n\nWhen a traveling carnival comes to a small Midwestern town, two best friends—Will Halloway (Vidal Peterson) and Jim Nightshade (Shawn Carson)—suspect that something is not quite right. They soon discover that the carnival’s mysterious boss, Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce), has nefarious plans for the townspeople and enlist the help of Will’s dad (Jason Robards) to help them stop him. Rad Bradbury wrote the screenplay for Something Wicked This Way Comes, based on his own 1962 novel, and the film was a rare foray into dark themes for Disney at the time, but developed a rabid cult following over the years. It’s been incredibly difficult to find for decades, so its arrival on Disney+ has fans rejoicing.\n\nThunderbolts*\n\nThough it failed to do Avengers numbers at the box office, leading many to label it a flop, ticket sales don’t always tell the full story—especially when it comes to the MCU. Florence Pugh reprises her role as Yelena Belova, a Black Widow–trained assassin who gets caught up in a sabotage plan concocted by corrupt CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When Yelena and her fellow killers-for-hire realize they’ve been duped into killing each other to clean up de Fontaine’s mess, they instead band together—with the help of Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Yelena’s dad/super soldier Red Guardian (David Harbour) to seek revenge. At this point it’s not really a spoiler to note that the asterisk in the title was meant to denote the placeholder title, as the group is rechristened the “New Avengers.”\n\nSacramento\n\nIn Sacramento, cowriter-director Michael Angarano stars as Rickey, an emotionally stunted man-child who is not ready to grow up, even as those around him have moved on to find careers, get married, and start families. Glenn (Michael Cera) is one of those old pals, who finds himself unwittingly agreeing to take a road trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento so that Rickey can scatter his recently deceased dad’s ashes. What follows is the stage of male friendship that happens somewhere between Superbad and Sideways, with both men learning something about each other—and themselves—whether they want to or not. Though the film was a hit with critics when it screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, it sadly flew largely under the radar in its brief theatrical run.\n\nJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story\n\nAs the original “summer blockbuster,” one might imagine that there are few behind-the-scenes stories fans have yet to hear from Steven Spielberg and Co. about the making of Jaws. But this Nat Geo documentary proves that even the movie’s most diehard fans might still have a thing or two to learn about the film that scared millions of beachgoers away from the water. In celebration of last year’s 50th anniversary of the film, this 90-minute doc features interviews with Spielberg—and many people who have been inspired by the movie over the years—to help you see it in a whole new light.\n\nMusic by John Williams\n\nSpeaking of the 50th anniversary of Jaws, now seems like the perfect time to show our appreciation for composer John Williams—without whom, that Steven Spielberg classic (and pretty much any Spielberg classic) would not feel the same. The second-most-nominated person in Oscar history (his 54 nominations are only bested by Walt Disney, who earned 59 nods), Williams has been producing memorable movie scores for nearly 70 years now and has quietly helped to turn movies into cinema. This original documentary gathers up some of the 93-year-old’s closest collaborators, including Spielberg and George Lucas—who swears that “Star Wars would basically not be Star Wars without Johnny Williams’ music.” It’s a touching, and perhaps long overdue, tribute to a true Hollywood titan.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nIn 2018, when Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hit theaters, it changed perceptions of what Spider-Man movies, and animated films, could be. No longer led by Peter Parker, a kid from Queens who gets bit by a radioactive spider, it was fronted by Miles Morales, a kid from Brooklyn who met a similar fate in another part of the multiverse. Across the Spider-Verse continues Miles’ story and his quest to save the multiverse, and his timeline, from a terrible fate. Fun, heartbreaking, and a thrill to watch, it’s one of the best Spider-Man movies ever. The trilogy’s final film, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, is set to arrive in theaters on June 4, 2027.\n\nThe Abyss\n\nIn many ways, The Abyss is the ultimate James Cameron movie. The idea for it first came to the filmmaker as a teenager, and it features all the storytelling and visual hallmarks of Cameron’s more famous movies. In a way, it’s essentially an underwater version of Aliens: A US submarine has been ambushed and sunk to the bottom of the ocean in the Caribbean. A Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) and two petroleum engineers with a sticky romantic past (Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are sent on a rescue mission, but are racing against the clock as a storm is gathering above the water and Soviet ships attempt to the reach the sunken sub before their American counterparts arrive. As one might expect in a Cameron flick, all is not as straightforward as it seems, and the rescuers encounter what is deemed “non-terrestrial intelligence.” Though originally released in 1989, this new 4K restoration gives new life to Cameron’s underwater sci-fi classic.\n\nElton John: Never Too Late\n\nSlowly but surely, filmmaker R. J. Cutler is becoming America's foremost chronicler of celebrity. After covering Billie Eilish, Martha Stewart, and James Belushi, the documentarian has now trained his lens on Elton John. Following the hitmaker as he prepares for his final North American show at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium in 2022, which livestreamed on Disney+, Elton John: Never Too Late jumps back and forth in time, using archival interviews and previously unseen footage to unearth a full picture of the musician's decades-long career. If nothing else, think of it as a companion piece to the 2019 biopic Rocketman.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nThe Deadpool movies have always stood out for being proudly anti–superhero movie and boldly R-rated. Even though Deadpool & Wolverine is the first film in the series that’s officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (it only took several years of production delays and one massive studio acquisition to make that happen), it's just as raunchy as the installments that came before. Six years after Ryan Reynolds last graced screens as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool has hit what might be his rock bottom. When he’s given the opportunity to regain the lives and loves he lost in another timeline, he must enlist the help of an extremely disinterested Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to make it happen. Reynolds and Jackman’s onscreen chemistry is electric, making this one (foul-mouthed) team-up you don’t want to miss.\n\nRoad Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band\n\nBruce Springsteen came out of the Covid-19 lockdowns revved up and ready to put on one hell of a show. For Road Diary, The Boss gave director Thom Zimny an all-access pass to the creation of the tour he and and the E Street Band have been on since 2024, including archival footage and interviews with the band and Springsteen himself. Zimny has been documenting the rocker’s life on the road for more than two decades now—and won two Emmy Awards for his efforts (for 2001’s Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City and 2018’s Springsteen on Broadway)—making this documentary essential viewing for any fan.\n\nInside Out\n\nDon’t cry. But also cry. A lot. Inside Out is the perfect realization of what every Pixar film strives to achieve. On the surface, it’s a comedic look at human emotion, the complexity of a child growing up, and the delicate balance of family life. But by literally getting inside the head of 11-year-old Riley, the film finds a way to bring emotion to life in a way that is at once comedic, profound, and often ingenious.\n\nInside Out 2\n\nThough it arrived 10 years after the release of Pixar’s Oscar-winning Inside Out, this sequel picks up just two years after the original film's ending. Riley, now 13 years old, is officially a teenager—and not quite ready to contend with the various new emotions that come with that phase. Among them: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Fortunately for all of them, not to mention Riley’s parents, Joy (Amy Poehler) is still there to help balance these emotions out. Yet again, Pixar triumphs in making a movie with a message that is also fun for the whole family.\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\n“There’s definitely been ups and downs,” says singer/songwriter Mike Love in The Beach Boys. “We’ve probably been counted out half a dozen times.” Yet more than 60 years after the band’s founding, these California Dreamers have managed to defy audience expectations just as many times—and redefine what pop music can be in the process. Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny codirect this insightful documentary, which features brand-new interviews with Love, the late Brian Wilson, and Al Jardine—not to mention the many artists they have inspired (Lindsey Buckingham, Janelle Monae, Don Was, and Ryan Tedder among them).\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox\n\nWes Anderson assembled an all-star cast and crew for this gorgeous stop-motion animation adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s novel. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) makes a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) that he’ll stop his farm-raiding ways when she reveals that she is pregnant. Years later, the crafty canine is feeling angsty and tempted to return to his criminal pastimes when temptation comes knocking right next door. But Mrs. Fox starts to suspect something is amiss when a bounty of fresh food starts finding its way into their home. Even worse, the local farmers are none too happy about being raided by a pesky fox—and band together to do something about it. Noah Baumbach cowrote the script with Anderson, and the cast includes many of Anderson’s most frequent collaborators, including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson.\n\nJim Henson: Idea Man\n\nWatching the trailer for Jim Henson: Idea Man, it strikes you: How has there not been an exhaustive documentary about Jim Henson before now? Muppets, The Dark Crystal, Sesame Street—the puppeteer had a hand in all of them. In this documentary, Ron Howard looks at Henson's (tireless) work, his incredible impact, and the legacy he left behind.\n\nLet It Be\n\nIf Peter Jackson’s recently re-edited The Beatles Anthology or three-part Get Back docuseries (which are both also on Disney+) left you wanting even more unfiltered access to the Beatles, we’ve got both good news and bad news: Let It Be is the 1970 documentary from which much of the footage seen within that series was taken. On the plus side, the original 16-mm print of the film—which has gone mostly unseen for the past 50 years—has undergone a painstaking restoration, courtesy of Jackson (yet again). While it lacks some of the emotional nuance of the series, as we see less of the sometimes-uncomfortable interactions of a band on the verge of their breaking point, it serves as a wonderful time capsule in which it was created. Feel free to pair the two together for one long binge (and throw in Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing for good measure).\n\nSummer of Soul\n\nAhmir “Questlove” Thompson made his directorial debut with this feature documentary, which recounts the groundbreaking Harlem Cultural Festival—a six-week-long celebration of Black culture, including music, history, fashion, and beyond. The film features rarely-seen clips of performers such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Sly & the Family Stone. Why have you never heard of the event? Possibly because it was overshadowed by Woodstock, which took place during the same time in the summer of 1969. Ironically, when the film won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 2022 Academy Awards, it was overshadowed yet again: It’s the award that was being handed out when Will Smith infamously slapped Chris Rock on the stage. (Here’s your chance to rectify missing that acceptance speech.)\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version)\n\nWere you one of the lucky ones who saw Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in person? Did you see Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in theaters? Well guess what? You can now also watch it on Disney+! Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) is kind of like the one that played at AMC cinemas, but it's also got four new acoustic songs: “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” “I Can See You,” and “Maroon.” It also features the folklore track “Cardigan.” So, whether you saw the tour, the movie theater experience—or neither—there's now yet another way to take in Taylor. Are you ready for it?\n\nX-Men\n\nAny property as beloved as X-Men is bound to have more than a few detractors when it makes the leap from page to screen. But the first X-Men movie managed to impress skeptical comic book fans and newcomers to the mutant war with its compelling storyline and stellar cast, which included Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, and then-newcomer Hugh Jackman. The film kicked off the first in an ever-growing franchise of the battle between mutants and humans, which now totals 13 films and more than $6 billion in box office receipts. With X-Men now officially part of Marvel Studios, expect to see lots more of this expanded cast of characters (beginning with the aforementioned Deadpool & Wolverine and this year’s highly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday). Until then, though, go back and watch this 2000 classic, and prepare for the future.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n\nIt may be impossible to reach the heights achieved by timeless classics like Temple of Doom or Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this latest installment in the Indiana. Jones franchise puts the whip back in Harrison Ford’s hands, letting him fight Nazis and finally get (maybe) some closure to his artifact-hunting life. The movie, directed by James Mangold, also gets some fantastic humor and verve from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who plays Helena, the daughter of an old ally of Indy’s who has perhaps less-than-pure interest in the Dial of Destiny, an ancient time-travel device that Dr. Jones, of course, thinks belongs in a museum.\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n\nFar From Home, which stars Tom Holland as the Spandex-wearing superhero, is notable for being the first film in Phase Four of the MCU—and the first time we see an Avenger attempting to pick up the pieces following the events of Avengers: Endgame. For Peter Parker, that means taking a boring old class trip to Europe, which turns into anything but when Earth is attacked by a villainous group of Elementals, which Spidey can only fight with the help of the mysterious—and appropriately named—Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). Consider watching it to prep for Holland’s next web-slinging adventure, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, which officially arrives on July 31.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire\n\nDaniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a lightly employed voice actor and devoted dad of three who has just been dumped by his wife and is only allowed to see his children one day per week. So he does what any rational person would do: asks his brother, who just happens to be a makeup artist, to dress him up as an older woman and applies to become a nanny working for his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field). That Miranda doesn’t realize the person she has entrusted her children with is the man she was married to for more than a decade might speak more about her character. Ignore the ridiculous setup and instead enjoy more than two hours of Robin Williams going full Robin Williams. Bon appétit!\n\nBig\n\nTeenager Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes on a Zoltar machine that he could grow up overnight—and comes to find his older self (Tom Hanks) staring him back in the mirror the next morning. In an effort to hide his fast-forwarded body, Baskin hides out in New York City, where he falls backward into his dream job at a toy company and meets the woman of his dreams (Elizabeth Perkins). Big is the movie that made Tom Hanks, well, Tom Hanks (it also marked his first Oscar nomination). But it’s Robert De Niro who was originally set to star; when he was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, Hanks stepped in.\n\nFinding Nemo\n\nNemo (Alexander Gould) is a young clown fish with an imperfect fin and a dad (Albert Brooks) who worries endlessly about his son’s safety. Which is forgivable, given that Nemo’s mom—and all his siblings—were victims of a barracuda shortly before their eggs hatched. So when Nemo is captured while the duo are swimming in the Great Barrier Reef, it’s up to Marlin to find and save his only son. With an all-star cast of voice actors—led by the always-perfect Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful blue tang named Dory (who would go on to star in her own adventure)—Finding Nemo is part of the heyday of Pixar filmmaking where each film seemed to surpass the absolutely perfect one that preceded it.\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nThe late Rob Reiner directed many fantastic films throughout his career, and this adventure-comedy-fairytale—written by William Goldman (the legendary screenwriter who once famously said of Hollywood that “nobody knows anything”) from his own novel—is one of his most beloved works. The ever-quotable tale tells the story of a young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who is engaged to marry a prince (Chris Sarandon) but is really in love with former farmhand Westley (Carey Elwes), who she believes was killed in a pirate attack. When Buttercup is kidnapped just days ahead of her wedding, a chain of events proceed to possibly reunite the in-love couple, or spell death for one (or both) of them. Goldman was famously critical of his own work, but didn’t mind taking credit for two of his movies. The Princess Bride was one of them (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the other).\n\nThe Little Mermaid\n\nDoes the live-action version of The Little Mermaid improve upon the beloved 1989 animated classic? Of course not. But Disney is on a tear when it comes to reimagining the movies you loved as a kid, and this is one of the Mouse House’s better efforts. Oscar nominee Rob Marshall (Chicago, Mary Poppins Returns, Into the Woods) is behind the camera for this tale of a young mermaid who longs to be (sing it with us) “part of your world.” Yet it’s Halle Bailey, delivering a powerhouse performance as Ariel, who truly makes The Little Mermaid worth watching.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nWhether you think of Henry Selick’s imaginative stop-motion adventure as a Halloween film or a Christmas movie doesn’t really matter, as there’s never a bad time to add The Nightmare Before Christmas to your watch (or watch-again) list. When the mischief-makers in Halloweentown, including pumpkin king Jack Skellington, discover the magic of Christmas, they decide to kidnap Santa Claus and claim both holidays for themselves. Even in today’s CGI-soaked world, the artistry behind The Nightmare Before Christmas remains painfully impressive—and the macabre yet kid-friendly tone makes it a fun watch for the entire family. There’s also a sing-along version if you’re in the mood.\n\nCinderella\n\nIn case you don’t know the story: After Cinderella loses her beloved mother, her father marries a nasty woman with two equally nasty daughters. While they spend their days tormenting the kind-hearted Cinderella, Prince Charming, the most eligible bachelor in all the land, only has eyes for her. Seventy-five years after its original release, Cinderella remains a Disney classic for a reason. Now it’s back with an impressive 4K restoration that has been several years in the making.\n\nThe Incredible Hulk\n\nTo Marvel fans, Mark Ruffalo is the only Bruce Banner. But that’s only after Eric Bana tried on the supersized superhero’s tiny purple pants in 2003’s Hulk—and then passed them on to Edward Norton for this 2008 flick, which had the misfortune of hitting theaters just one month after Iron Man. The MCU has always had a messy timeline, but audiences shouldn’t be too quick to write this movie off, particularly those looking to kick back with a solid summer popcorn flick. Norton may lack Ruffalo’s effortless charm, but he’s got the Doc Green part of the character down.\n\nStan Lee\n\nEasily the most recognizable name in comics, Stan Lee has had an impact on the medium—and on pop culture broadly—that simply can’t be overstated. Director David Gelb’s documentary about “The Man” delves into not only his legacy, but also his history. Tracing the comics maestro’s life from his early years in New York City to his work cocreating iconic characters like Spider-Man and Black Panther to his time as everyone’s favorite Marvel movie cameo, Stan Lee is essential viewing for any fan.\n\nSpider-Man\n\nWhile Sam Raimi’s Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man movies predate the official MCU, the famed director really set the stage for what that future universe would look like, with its mix of solid storytelling, genuine laughs, and impressive visuals. Maguire is perfectly cast as the awkwardly charming Peter Parker, who—having just discovered his superhero powers—is learning to harness them.\n\nVenom\n\nVenom may not have been a hit with critics, but WIRED senior editor Angela Watercutter nailed exactly what the movie was when she called it “a bad movie with great cult-movie potential.” While it rivals Doctor Strange for its stacked cast of serious talent—Tom Hardy in the lead, with Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed costarring, plus Zombieland’s Reuben Fleischer as director—the end result was, well, a bit of a jumbled mess. Nonetheless, it somehow manages to be compelling, even if you just turn it on to watch Hardy mumble, eat Tater Tots, and almost literally chew scenery for 112 minutes. If you want to watch either of its two sequels, you’ll have to rent or go to Starz for 2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage, while 2024’s Venom: The Last Dance is on Netflix.\n\nThe Original Star Wars Trilogy\n\nNaturally, Star Wars is one of the big attractions on Disney+. And it goes without saying, or at least it should, that the films that comprise the original trilogy are the best of the bunch—and the only Star Wars movies you should watch if you’re opting not to binge all dozen or so features. The caveat for pickier fans is that these are the versions that have been messed with by George Lucas post-release. Some things, like the improved visuals in and around Cloud City, are thoughtful additions, but others are more controversial.\n\nThe Star Wars Prequel Trilogy\n\nMore than 20 years after Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope (aka simply Star Wars) helped to define the Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas returned to the space opera well with an all-new trilogy for an all-new generation of moviegoers. It went about as well as you’d expect. We won’t pretend that The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and/or Revenge of the Sith (2005) have even an ounce of the heart, humor, or heroism of the original films. But they’ve become essential pop culture viewing, and a rite of passage for sci-fi fans, if only to get what all the Jar Jar Binks hate is about.\n\nThe Star Wars Sequel Trilogy\n\nWhen Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, it was essentially George Lucas handing over the keys to the Millennium Falcon. While fans were rightly skeptical about whether the Mouse House would be able—or even want—to recapture the slightly countercultural environment in which the series was originally created, one hopeful thought united them all: Whatever Disney concocted could not be worse than the Prequel Trilogy. And they were right. By giving the reins to J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi), then Abrams once again (The Rise of Skywalker), the series became more of a love letter to the original films and the generations of filmmakers—and fans—they inspired. Happily, actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver proved worthy successors to the smugglers, scavengers, Jedi masters, and Sith Lords who preceded them.\n\nTurning Red\n\nMei Lee is a 13-year-old with a problem: Whenever she’s overcome with any sort of overwhelming emotion, which is just about every emotion at that age, she transforms into a giant red panda. Eventually, Mei comes to learn that it’s an inherited family trait. And while there are people who would like to exploit her supernatural powers, she slowly learns that only she has the power to control them. Think of this as a spiritual sequel to 2015’s Inside Out, which explored the complex inner workings of an 11-year-old’s constantly changing emotions.\n\nAbbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing\n\nAbbey Road Studios is best known as the place where the Beatles recorded some of their most iconic albums, including 1969’s Abbey Road. But the hallowed halls of this legendary music studio have played a much bigger role in the music industry, as it has hosted the likes of everyone from Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Adele, Oasis, Kate Bush, and Frank Ocean. This documentary, which arrived on the heels of Peter Jackson’s docuseries The Beatles: Get Back (which is also streaming on Disney+ and is highly recommended), is directed by Mary McCartney—daughter of Sir Paul—who practically grew up in the studio and, as such, is able to treat her subject with the reverence it deserves.\n\nAvatar\n\nJames Cameron’s Avatar was all anyone could talk about when it was released in theaters in 2009 and promptly went on to make more than $1 billion, becoming the cinematic iceberg that sank another Cameron epic, 1997’s Titanic, from its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time. For a movie that made so much bank, however, it never occupied a huge space in the cultural conversation about movies. Like so many of Cameron’s works, much of its innovation came from the technology that essentially had to be invented to make it possible.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water\n\nOne week before Avatar hit theaters (for the first time) in late 2009, James Cameron announced his intention to turn the movie into a full-on franchise. But the director took his sweet time in following through. Avatar: The Way of Water—which checks in on blue lovebirds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), now married with children—was released in late 2022, a full 13 years after the original made its debut. But Cameron smartly bought himself some time by setting the film 16 years after the events of Avatar. And while the critical reviews were mixed, it still ended up becoming the third-highest-grossing movie of all time, proving yet again that Cameron has some sort of Midas touch at the box office. Avatar: Fire and Ash, which arrived in theaters last December, has already surpassed $1 billion in ticket sales.\n\nIron Man\n\nThe MCU has released nearly three dozen films since 2008, yet the very first of them—Iron Man—remains one of the best. It’s almost impossible to believe how hard director Jon Favreau had to fight to get Robert Downey Jr. the leading role, as he’s arguably one of the MCU’s most beloved figures. Before there was a whole franchise plus a shared TV universe, Downey, as Tony Stark/Iron Man, was just allowed to do his thing. It was a gamble that paid off for all involved.\n\nLady and the Tramp\n\nSure, you can watch the live-action/CGI version that Disney+ released shortly after it launched, but why bother when the 1955 original is here too? Put aside the rather vulgar stereotypes that were common at the time (the movie now comes with a warning, though it was recently reworded) and Lady and the Tramp remains one of the most iconic Disney animations, and a love story for the ages. When a spoiled cocker spaniel named Lady finds herself competing with a new baby for the attention of her parents, she ends up getting loose and befriending a mangy but charming mutt named Tramp. Ultimately, Lady needs to choose between the pampered life she’s always known with Jim Dear and Darling, or a life of spaghetti dinner discards with the hopelessly romantic Tramp—unless there’s another way.\n\nThe Muppet Movie\n\nBetween The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie, Jim Henson and the Muppets were everywhere in 1979. Their first big-screen outing serves as more of a prequel, as it follows Kermit the Frog’s journey from a swamp in Florida to Hollywood, where he’s headed to pursue his dreams of becoming a movie star. Along the way, we get to witness where and how he meets the fellow members of his felt-made crew, from Fozzie Bear to Miss Piggy. Hijinks ensue when a restaurateur named Doc Hopper doesn’t take too kindly to Kermit turning down his offer to serve as the official legs of his chain’s famous fried frog legs, and follows the frog in order to seek revenge.\n\nLuca\n\nEnrico Casarosa’s Luca earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature in 2022 for its sweet and soulful story about a young boy named Luca who is hiding a dark secret: He's a sea monster living in a town on the Italian Riviera that absolutely despises his kind. Ultimately, Luca is a moving coming-of-age film about friendship, family, and overcoming our own prejudices—and truly one of Pixar’s best features.\n\nCaptain Marvel\n\nMarvel's biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioning Captain Marvel sooner. The film, set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The film, the first entry in the Marvel universe with a female lead, channels the spirit of the 1990s both in its setting and in style, with heaping spoonfuls of Samuel L. Jackson and all the plot and subtlety of a blockbuster action movie. Larson adds a healthy dose of sarcasm to undercut her character’s immense power, and Jackson is eerily brilliant, making for a super fun 123 minutes.\n\nAnt-Man\n\nWho doesn’t love a heist movie? Paul Rudd’s MCU debut acted as something of a palate cleanser after the heavy, literally Earth-shattering events of Age of Ultron. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a reformed criminal who teams up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lily) to keep Pym’s shrinking technology from falling into the wrong hands. The film’s depiction of quantum physics wouldn’t hold much water at CERN, but it’s terrific fun—thanks in part to Michael Peña’s star turn as Lang’s former cellmate Luis and, of course, Rudd’s legendary likability. If you want to make it a Rudd-athon, both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania are streaming, too.\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nThere's a moment in the event-movie-to-endgame-all-event-movies when you realize that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have gone full Harry Potter and the Cursed Child all over the MCU. Once you get past the rather glum beginning, you can settle in for what you have come to expect from any Avengers movie: Tony Stark cracking wise; Doctor Strange doing weird things with his hands; Professor Hulk explaining the science of what’s going on; and Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass, both emotionally and physically. It's a messy but epic baton-pass in the form of an angsty portal-powered mega-battle. And we're not going to lie: We've watched those audience reaction videos, and they too are a thing of joy.\n\nHamilton\n\nIf you only know Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical from the obscenely high ticket prices and snippets of the soundtrack, here’s your chance to find out what all the fuss is about. A version of the production, recorded via a six-camera setup over two performances by the original Broadway cast, was put on Disney+ after plans to release it in cinemas were scrapped. Aside from a couple of censored swear words and the fact that it's directed (by Thomas Kail), it's essentially the same show—an energetic, empathetic, witty, quippy hip-hop musical about US founding father Alexander Hamilton.\n\nMoana\n\nOne of the potential answers to “What, oh, what to put on after Frozen and Frozen 2?” Moana is in fact better than Frozen. By that we simply mean better soundtrack, better heroine, better visuals, and better side quests. There's also 100 percent more Dwayne Johnson as a tattooed demigod and Jemaine Clement as a giant crab doing a Bowie impression. Set thousands of years ago on the fictional, Polynesia-inspired island of Motunui, Moana's hero's journey is fairly classic, but the sumptuous animation and Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are top-tier Disney. (Sure, we'd love to see Taika Waititi's original script, but we can live without it.) Moana 2, 2024’s less well-received sequel, is also streaming on Disney+ (as are sing-along versions for both films).\n\nFree Solo\n\nIf your friend told you they'd decided to solo-climb up the sheer 3,000-foot granite El Capitan wall in Yosemite, California, with no rope, you’d think they had gone mad. But that’s exactly what Alex Honnold set out to do back in 2017. Honnold’s quest to climb the vertical wall was documented by his two director friends, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, as he took on the ascent to become the world’s first person to free-climb El Capitan. But it’s not just about the ascent, it’s also about Honnold’s complicated life, his emotional issues, and all the things that have driven him to pursue one of the most dangerous missions ever attempted by any free climber. The cinematography in Free Solo is also dizzyingly beautiful, and the entire thing will have you gripping the arm of your chair in terror.\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids\n\nWayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an experimental inventor who creates an electromagnetic shrinking machine. Naturally, he accidentally shrinks his own children (if you didn’t already guess that from the title), plus the kids from next door, then unwittingly throws them in the trash. To have any chance of becoming their normal size again, the teeny tots must navigate their way across the family's (now seemingly gigantic) yard and back to the house. It's something fraught with peril when you're half the size of an aspirin.\n\nToy Story (All of Them)\n\nWhile it initially might have seemed as if Pixar could never make anything as good as the original 1995 Toy Story, each of the three subsequent films add depth to the franchise's canon. All of the movies are critically acclaimed—and they're all available on Disney+. When combined, the four films tell a story about growing up and how everything in life, inevitably, changes. Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang go from learning how to deal with new people to understanding loss. It's something that's also followed the cast: In Toy Story 4, the voice of Mr. Potato Head was created through archive recordings after Don Rickles, as the man behind the voice, died ahead of the film's release.\n\nThe Lion King\n\nRemember the terrifying wildebeest stampede in the 1994 version of The Lion King? That was actually computer animated, because drawing them by hand would have taken a long, long time. Special attention was taken to blend it into the cel-shaded backgrounds, and this was all before Toy Story came out the following year. Which is all to say that not only is the '90s version a perfect movie that had absolutely zero need for a charm-deficient 2019 remake (which is also streaming on Disney+ in case you want to compare), it’s also the best Lion King to use CG animation.\n\n10 Things I Hate About You\n\nHeath Ledger singing “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” on the bleachers. That’s the iconic scene in this top-caliber high school romcom. The plot is taken from The Taming of the Shrew, the cast—including Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt—are all adorable, and the late '90s nostalgia is potent. Offering some much-needed variety from the sci-fi and animation that dominates the Disney+ launch catalog, 10 Things I Hate About You is as good as comfort-food movies get.\n\nTron & Tron: Legacy\n\nTron and its modern sequel, Tron: Legacy, aren't your typical Disney films. The original sees a programmer (Jeff Bridges) become trapped inside a computer system where he meets and befriends programs, including the eponymous hero Tron, who are resisting the power of a growing artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program. It became a sci-fi cult classic, leading to the creation of a modern sequel that continues the story and features an epic score cowritten by Daft Punk. Both are watchable distractions, even if the sequel feels a little thin in places.\n\nWillow\n\nAnother nostalgia fest, this time for fans of '80s fantasy. Willow is a family-friendly, mythic quest that’s best seen as George Lucas and Ron Howard’s fun, $35 million Tolkien fan fiction. The story of a farmer tasked with protecting a magic baby from an evil queen is not exactly the most original story in the world, but that hasn’t stopped this from becoming a classic, with Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood and Val Kilmer waving a sword around. Classic Sunday afternoon fare.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nWinter Soldier is among the best Marvel movies. It makes time for quieter character moments, and the action, while still spectacular, feels a little more grounded and real than the CGI-fueled shock and awe of the mainline movies. In this outing, Captain America faces off against a rogue element of SHIELD led by Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce.\n\nThor: Ragnarok\n\nThe first two Thor films were among the worst in the whole series—Chris Hemsworth’s thunder god was dour and charmless. But here, director Taika Waititi injected some much-needed color into the proceedings, borrowing heavily from the Planet Hulk storyline from the comics. Thor finds himself stranded on a bizarre planet, ruled over by Jeff Goldblum (who is pretty much playing himself). There, he crosses paths with Bruce Banner’s Hulk, who has been missing since the events of Civil War. It’s hugely funny, and arguably the best film of the series.\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\n\nThe newer Star Wars one-off films attract strong opinions, and Rogue One is no different. But while it has its issues, it fills an important hole in the universe and features some of the best action sequences in the entire saga. Its main black mark is the rather iffy CGI recreation of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin, but it's still a fun romp that lacks the narrative baggage of the new trilogy.\n\nBlack Panther\n\nBlack Panther had a huge cultural impact. It was refreshingly unusual to see a blockbuster superhero film with such a diverse cast—and the Afrofuturist setting was unlike anything Marvel had ever done before. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, who returns to his father’s home to claim the throne from T’Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman).\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nAs WIRED senior writer Jason Parham wrote in his review of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, this movie is haunted by the absence of Chadwick Boseman, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original King T’Challa who died following a battle with colon cancer in 2020. To that end, writer-director Ryan Coogler had to make a much different kind of superhero film, one that addressed the loss of its main character while also pushing Marvel's cinematic storyline forward into its next phase. “It's rare for MCU films to channel the turbulence of grief with such unflinching focus,” Parham wrote. “Coogler has equipped his sequel with a changed vocabulary: It speaks equally from a place of loss as it does triumph. Grief is its mother tongue.” To that end, the director uses the death of T'Challa to usher in a new Black Panther as well as new heroes (Ironheart) and adversaries-turned-allies (Namor).\n\nWALL·E\n\nReleased in 2008, a time when, for many, the climate crisis felt like a distant, abstract threat, WALL·E is classic Pixar. It’s a love story—sort of—that focuses on two robots. But it’s also a story about survival, believing in yourself, and dancing through the vacuum of space propelled by a fire extinguisher. The animation, especially on the desolate, barren Earth, is a sight to behold. The opening scenes of the film are also basically a silent film, with the score and robotic sound effects doing a fantastic job bringing out the emotion and drama of what’s happening.\n\nUp\n\nPixar's Up can claim one of the most moving opening scenes of any movie. Despite being released more than a decade ago, in 2009, the animation hasn't aged or lost any of its charm. In a little over 90 minutes, director Pete Docter takes us on the journey of Carl, an old widower who is seeking out Paradise Falls. Carl's trip in his flying house is made in memory of his wife, Ellie, who had always wanted to visit the falls. The film won two Oscars—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score—but was also nominated for three more. These included Best Picture, which at the time made it only the second animated film to have received the nomination (1991’s Beauty and the Beast—which is also streaming on Disney+, and most definitely worth a rewatch—was the first).\n\nThe Jungle Book\n\nWhatever mood you're in, Disney+ has The Jungle Book to suit it. The streaming service has both the 1967 animated classic, with its catchy soundtrack and moments of humor, plus the live-action version released in 2016. The two films couldn't be more different. If you want to go for full family entertainment, pick the original, but if you're after something a little darker, the modern remake is where you should head. (Bonus fact: The entire live-action film was shot in a warehouse.)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nThe first volume of Guardians of the Galaxy didn't burst into the MCU until 2014, which is relatively late considering Phase One began with Iron Man in 2008. However, it's become a firm fan favorite, providing some of the Universe's most memorable (and important) characters. Quill, Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Nebula are all distinctive and in many ways more likable than other key MCU characters. Guardians is worth returning to if you want to remember a slightly simpler time before Thanos' Snap.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T21:54:04.061432"}

The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds, when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations, companies like Sony, Apple, Bose, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.\n\nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\n\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test wireless earbuds Collapse Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, because earbud makers often reserve certain software tricks for their preferred ecosystems, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms. Comfort Collapse No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip we can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one ear needs a bigger or smaller tip than the other. Good sound Collapse Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, we care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music we’re listening to. We want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. We look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in our favorite songs. Active noise cancellation Collapse What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings. Long battery life Collapse Most earbuds these days offer between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with. Water resistance Collapse Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At a minimum, you should look for earbuds with IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\n\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s latest QC Ultra Earbuds. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\n\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\n\nThe WF-1000XM5 are smaller and more comfortable than their M4 predecessors. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\n\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\n\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.\n\nThe Ear (a) are Nothing’s first earbuds that aren’t only offered black or white. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point, especially since they often can be found for as little as $60. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ear 3, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\n\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\n\nThe name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen earbuds bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.\n\nBose has again delivered top-notch noise-canceling performance with the second-gen Ultra earbuds. Photo by John Higgins / The Verge\n\nAlthough Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.\n\nAs with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.\n\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\n\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 have an ear-hook design for maximum stability. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\n\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.\n\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\n\nApple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features at the end of 2024. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with (yet again) improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and more battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.\n\nThe new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, when combined with better ANC performance, deliver the best overall noise cancellation in a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is nearly identical to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (though some people might not notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.\n\nApple’s AirPods Pro 3. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nBut what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, first seen with the Powerbeats Pro 2, enables heart rate tracking for 50 workout types from directly within the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data.\n\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\n\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\n\nThe Buds 3 Pro are an ideal match for Samsung’s latest phones. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\n\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\n\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\n\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help keep them in place while performing various activities, including running and other forms of intensive exercise.\n\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest pair of premium earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\n\nGoogle really downsized the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (bottom) compared to the original pair (top). Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\n\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\n\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\n\nThe translucent color option has a very ‘90s vibe. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\n\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\n\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\n\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\n\nThat copper finish is pretty nice. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. They’re even LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\n\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\n\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\n\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\n\nBoth iterations of the AirPods 4 deliver a thicker bass layer than previous models. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes... there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\n\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\n\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\n\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we still haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\n\nThe advantage of stemmed earbuds is that they position the mics closer to your mouth.\n\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet and Zoom, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nTo the surprise of no one, several companies — including JBL, Anker, and Shokz — announced open-style earbuds at CES 2025. The $179.99 Anker AeroFit 2 Pro are probably the most interesting of the bunch, as they feature an adjustable ear hook design that lets you wear them in one of several ways, allowing you to leverage active noise cancellation or wear them in a manner that continues to let outside noise in. The $249.95 Shokz OpenFit Pro, meanwhile, feature noise reduction, which isn’t as impressive as true ANC in our testing but remains impressive for a pair of wireless earbuds that sit outside your ears.\n\nWe don’t anticipate either model dethroning our picks above, but stay tuned for our full impressions in the coming weeks.\n\nUpdate, January 8th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, as well as several related links.

An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as news figures, crime victims, and even world leaders.\n\nA December 31st research paper from Copyleaks estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found far more. A sample gathered from January 5th to 6th found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period.\n\nBut while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given recent reporting from CNN that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok.\n\nIt’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account posted on January 3rd, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk.\n\nIn the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom issued a statement on Monday, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In a radio interview on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.”\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn, Australian eSafety commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale’s website, where the software was said to have “helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles.” Businesses can “track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more.” Even “police departments use it for investigating.”\n\nBut this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it.\n\nWhen you’re sleeping\n\nIt’s unclear when pcTattletale began marketing itself as a tool for catching cheaters, but Fleming’s original business partner left the company in 2011, and Fleming ran things himself from his home in a northern Detroit suburb.\n\nIn 2021, Vice reported that pcTattletale was leaking the sensitive data it collected. The story quoted marketing materials about using the tool to catch a “cheating spouse,” which required users to know their spouse’s “pass-code and have access to the phone for about 5 minutes. The best time to do this is when they are sleeping.” The company also provided instructions to hide icons that might reveal that pcTattletale was running on the victim’s phone.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:02:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-08T22:27:26.181788"}

But up to this point, Dolby Atmos has only been available in luxury vehicles that have a whole array of speakers.\n\nPioneer is changing that with the Sphera, an aftermarket in-dash receiver with a 10.1-inch capacitive screen that enables Dolby Atmos playback in Apple CarPlay. And it works with as few as four speakers installed in your car, creating the Atmos environment with virtualization.\n\nThe Pioneer Sphera head unit fits in a single-DIN or double-DIN slot in your car’s dash. Once installed, initial setup involves placing an included mic at the driver’s headrest and leaving the car for about five minutes to allow Pioneer’s processing to calibrate the system to your car’s interior. Once complete, you can select your listening sweet spot on the screen as driver, passenger, or the whole cabin. I heard the Sphera in action in a 2017 Toyota Highlander with four speakers and a sub. For the demo, the stock speakers had been replaced with Pioneer A-Series speakers that cost around $100 each.\n\nPioneer’s virtualization does an impressive job properly filling the cabin using just four speakers. While listening to the opening of “Money” from Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, the cash register sounds were placed in their appropriate positions throughout the cabin, and when the full band came in, the interior felt bigger than it was. Similarly, the oohs and aahs in the chorus of “Rocket Man” blossomed and surrounded Elton John’s vocals.\n\nThe placement didn’t have quite the same specificity you can get with more than four speakers, but that doesn’t take away from the experience in a significant way. The Sphera still delivers a rich and full sonic landscape that properly fills the space within a car’s cabin. Pioneer’s Sphera will be available in the spring for $1,300.

But there was only one Apple Watch when the smartwatch launched in 2015. A decade later, you’ve got three flavors to choose from: the entry-level Watch SE, the standard Series, and the rugged Ultra. Each appeals to a different demographic and set of needs, but good news: I’ve tested every Apple Watch dating back to the Series 2 and can point you in the right direction.\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test Apple Watches Collapse Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life. Who is it for? Collapse We’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs. Price Collapse Should you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying a last-gen model or a refurbished one, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year. Feature set Collapse Do you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you? Cellular or GPS Collapse Some scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, while others you can get away with GPS alone.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for most people\n\nSizes: 40mm, 44mm / Weight: 26.3g (40mm), 32.9g (44mm) / Battery life: Up to 18 hours / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB\n\nThe third-gen Apple Watch SE is an incredible value. So much so, there’s not that much of a difference between this entry-level watch and the more advanced Series 11. There’s now an always-on display, an improved S10 chip that enables gestures like double-tap and wrist flick, fast-charging, on-device Siri, 5G cellular, and additional health features thanks to the new wrist-temperature sensor. For folks who are in relatively good health, you don’t necessarily need advanced health features like blood oxygen or EKGs for afib detection. The SE 3 still gets you the basics like abnormal heart rate notifications, the new Sleep Score, and sleep apnea notifications.\n\nAside from health, you’re only really giving up on aesthetics. The SE 3 has a thicker bezel, and I wish battery life were a bit longer. Still, I had zero FOMO while testing this watch alongside the Series 11. And for $150 less? This is the Apple Watch most people should buy.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for health monitoring\n\nSizes: 42mm, 46mm / Weight: 30.3g (42mm), 37.8 (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 24 hours, 38 in low-power mode / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB\n\nWhile I maintain the SE 3 is the best for most people, if health monitoring is your primary focus, the Series 11 has a slight edge. It’s got all the advanced sensors that enable afib monitoring, and the bigger battery is a bonus if sleep tracking and sleep apnea features appeal to you. Apple has also added FDA-cleared hypertension notifications, which the SE 3 doesn’t have. Its slimmer profile and larger display are other reasons I recommend the Series 11 to anyone buying an Apple Watch for a parent.\n\nBut if you’re looking to save some moola, I recommend hunting for a Series 10 while there’s still stock available. The Series 10 and 11 are nearly identical watches, with the latter’s main hardware upgrades being 5G connectivity and a modest bump to battery life.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for athletes\n\nSizes: 42mm, 46mm / Weight: 30.3g (42mm), 37.8 (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 24 hours, 38 in low-power mode / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 is overkill for daily life. Its extra durability, bright screen, siren, and Action Button are best suited for folks who have active lifestyles. I’m talking about frequent hikes, outdoor runs, recreational diving, and all that jazz. You don’t have to be an athlete to enjoy the Ultra — I know plenty of Tech Dads in particular who love this watch for its extra-long battery life and the bigger display. (Both reasons why I’ve also used the Ultra as my daily driver for the past two years.) The black model also looks sick.\n\nLike with the Series watches, I’d hunt for a discount on a last-gen Ultra 2 for a teeny bit of savings since this year’s model was a minor upgrade. Also, if you already have an Ultra 2, hold your horses! Now is not the time to upgrade. The exception is if you think you’ll find value in the new satellite connectivity feature. I’ve gone on multiple hikes in New Jersey and haven’t found an area without coverage — but if you’re in a rural area where that’s an issue, this is a valid reason to opt for the Ultra 3.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n\nSizes: 40mm, 44mm / Weight: 26.3g (40mm), 32.9g (44mm) / Battery life: Up to 18 hours / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB\n\nUnless there are explicit health issues at play, your kids don’t need a Series 11’s advanced health tracking, nor do they need the Ultra 3’s bulky design. An SE 3 is more than sufficient for keeping tabs and staying in touch. Plus, if you’re buying for a younger, rambunctious child, the SE 3 comes in the smallest size and won’t burn as big a hole in your wallet if it breaks. But if you’re not keen on giving your child their own iPhone just yet, make sure you’re getting a cellular model so you can take advantage of the Apple Watch For Your Kids setup feature.\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nNow that Apple’s fall hardware events are behind us, we don’t anticipate any changes to the Apple Watch lineup until the end of 2026, especially given that Apple typically refreshes its smartwatches only once a year. The next big update to look forward to may be what’s in store for watchOS, the next iteration of which will likely be unveiled at Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.\n\nUpdate, January 8th: Updated pricing / availability and updated the copy to reflect the new year.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-08T19:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T02:08:39.310449"}

We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.\n\nLet’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.\n\nNvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.\n\nThe Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.\n\nAnd Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.\n\nAMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships\n\nAMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!\n\nHighlights from CES breakout sessions\n\nCES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.\n\nFord’s AI assistant debuts\n\nFord is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.\n\nCaterpillar, Nvidia partner on automated construction equipment\n\nAs part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.\n\nHands-on with Clicks Communicator\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nOne of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.\n\nCheck out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:\n\n“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes.

A member of a Special Response Team, ICE’s version of a SWAT team, he’s had duties as a firearms trainer and led teams drawn from multiple federal agencies including the FBI, Ross testified.\n\nThe testimony stems from a December 2025 trial related to a June incident with parallels to the interaction that led to Good’s killing.\n\nIn June according to Ross’s testimony, he led a team seeking to apprehend a man named Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala, who was on an administrative warrant for being in the United States without authorization. Because the man’s home was across from a school and immigration agents had no authority to enter his home, Ross testified, they instead trailed him in unmarked vehicles.\n\nMuñoz-Guatemala’s attorney did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the December testimony and a New York Times account of an FBI agent’s affidavit associated with the case, Ross approached Muñoz-Guatemala and asked him to roll down his window and open his door. Ross, who testified that he had been driving an unmarked vehicle, was dressed in ranger green and grey, and wore his badge on his belt, broke the driver’s side back window and reached into the vehicle, at which point Muñoz-Guatemala pulled away.\n\nWhile being dragged at a speed he claimed seemed like “40 miles an hour at least, if not more,” Ross pulled out his Taser and fired it at the driver. Muñoz-Guatemala continued to drive, and succeeded in shaking Ross from the car. At trial, Ross testified that he suffered injuries that required 33 stitches.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Muñoz-Guatemala called 911 to report that he’d been assaulted by ICE, which led to his arrest. Last month, he was convicted of assault on a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.\n\nReports from the Minnesota Star-Tribune and The Guardian identified Ross as the shooter who killed Good, a mother and recent transplant to Minneapolis, during an immigration enforcement action in the city. Video of the incident appears to show a federal agent firing shots into Good’s vehicle as she attempted to leave the scene. The officer did not appear to have been struck by the vehicle, and Good appeared to be turning the wheel to avoid contact, video analysis by The New York Times and the Washington Post shows.\n\nAt Thursday’s White House press briefing, vice president JD Vance answered questions about the incident, and his responses included numerous identifying details about Ross, mainly relating to his interaction with Muñoz-Guatemala. “That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car, six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg,” said Vance, “so you think maybe he is a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile?”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security secretary Kirsti Noem has repeatedly described Good’s actions as an intentional act of “domestic terrorism.” An FBI investigation into Good’s killing is ongoing.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told WIRED in a statement that the department is “not going to expose the name of this officer. He acted according to his training.” McLaughlin added that federal immigration agents “are under constant threat from violent agitators” because of “doxxing” and that the Minnesota Star Tribune, which first published Ross’ name, “should delete their story immediately.”According to Ross’ December testimony, he served in the Indiana National Guard and was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 as a machine gunner on a patrol truck, then joined Border Patrol in 2007 after finishing college, working near El Paso, Texas.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:19:26 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T03:48:35.905735"}

James “JD” Polk, NASA’s chief health and medical officer, told reporters Thursday the crew member is “absolutely stable” but that the agency is “erring on the side of caution” with the decision to bring to return the astronaut to Earth.\n\nThe ailing astronaut is part of the Crew-11 mission, which launched to the station August 1 and was slated to come back to Earth around February 20. Instead, the Crew-11 astronauts will depart the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming days and head for reentry and a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.\n\n“After discussions with our chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, and leadership across the agency, I’ve come to the decision that it’s in the best interests of our astronauts to return Crew-11 ahead of their planned departure,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Thursday.\n\nThe Crew-11 mission is led by commander Zena Cardman, 38, who is wrapping up her first mission to space.

The crew will home home aboard the same SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft they launched in more than five months ago. The entire crew must return to Earth together because they rely on the same Dragon spacecraft as a lifeboat.\n\n“For over 60 years, NASA has set the standard for safety and security in crewed spaceflight,” Isaacman said. “In these endeavors, including the 25 years of continuous human presence onboard the International Space Station, the health and well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority.”\n\nCredit: SpaceX From left to right: Crew-11 mission specialist Oleg Platonov, pilot Mike Fincke, commander Zena Cardman, and mission specialist Kimiya Yui.

{"title": "The Oceans Just Keep Getting Hotter", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-oceans-just-keep-getting-hotter/", "summary": "For the eighth year in a row, the world’s oceans absorbed a record-breaking amount of heat in 2025. It was equivalent to the energy it would take to boil 2 billion Olympic swimming pools.", "content": "Since 2018, a group of researchers from around the world have crunched the numbers on how much heat the world’s oceans are absorbing each year. In 2025, their measurements broke records once again, making this the eighth year in a row that the world’s oceans have absorbed more heat than the years before.\n\nThe study, which was published Friday in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science, found that the world’s oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules’ worth of heat in 2025, the most in any year since modern measurements began in the 1960s. That’s significantly higher than the 16 additional zettajoules they absorbed in 2024. The research comes from a team of more than 50 scientists across the United States, Europe, and China.\n\nA joule is a common way to measure energy. A single joule is a relatively small unit of measurement—it’s about enough to power a tiny lightbulb for a second, or slightly heat a gram of water. But a zettajoule is one sextillion joules; numerically, the 23 zettajoules the oceans absorbed this year can be written out as 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.\n\nJohn Abraham, a professor of thermal science at the University of St. Thomas and one of the authors on the paper, says that he sometimes has trouble putting this number into contexts laypeople understand. Abraham offers up a couple options. His favorite is comparing the energy stored in the ocean to the energy of atomic bombs: The 2025 warming, he says, is the energetic equivalent to 12 Hiroshima bombs exploding in the ocean. (Some other calculations he’s done include equating this number to the energy it would take to boil 2 billion Olympic swimming pools, or more than 200 times the electrical use of everyone on the planet.)\n\n“Last year was a bonkers, crazy warming year—that's the technical term,” Abraham joked to me. “The peer-reviewed scientific term is ‘bonkers’.”\n\nThe world’s oceans are its largest heat sink, absorbing more than 90 percent of the excess warming that is trapped in the atmosphere. While some of the excess heat warms the ocean’s surface, it also slowly travels further down into deeper parts of the ocean, aided by circulation and currents.\n\nGlobal temperature calculations—like the ones used to determine the hottest years on record—usually only capture measurements taken at the ocean’s surface. (The study finds that overall sea surface temperatures in 2025 were slightly lower than they were in 2024, which is on record as the hottest year since modern records began. Some meteorological phenomena, like El Niño events, can also raise sea surface temperatures in certain regions, which can cause the overall ocean to absorb slightly less heat in a given year. This helps to explain why there was such a big jump in added ocean heat content between 2025, which developed a weak La Niña at the end of the year, and 2024, which came at the end of a strong El Niño year.) While sea surface temperatures have risen since the industrial revolution, thanks to our use of fossil fuels, these measurements don’t provide a full picture of how climate change is affecting the oceans.\n\n“If the whole world was covered by a shallow ocean that was only a couple feet deep, it would warm up more or less at the same speed as the land,” says Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth and a coauthor of the study. “But because so much of that heat is going down in the deep ocean, we see generally slower warming of sea surface temperatures [than those on land].”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T08:38:49.975011"}

The company’s claim is that its purifier's release of high-density (2,000–5,000 ions per cubic centimeter) negative oxygen ions delivers a “refreshing, forestlike atmosphere,” which will boost energy, reduce stress, and improve sleep—all without ozone, radiation, or static. It also uses a HEPA 14, a denser filter than the more ubiquitous HEPA 13s that most air purifiers use.\n\nI’ve tested air purifiers for years, and I usually stay away from purifiers that serve up ion technology. As the EPA explains, “Ozone, a lung irritant, is produced indirectly by ion generators and some other electronic air cleaners and directly by ozone generators.” The California Air Resources Board has a list of those air purifiers that do more harm than good.\n\nPhotograph: Lisa Wood Shapiro\n\nThe Burtran has been tested and is not on that list.

Created in just six months, it was meant to correct a rare genetic mutation that was causing toxic ammonia to build up in his small body. The treatment likely saved his life, and baby KJ was discharged from the hospital in June.\n\nNow, a new startup called Aurora Therapeutics, cofounded by gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna, is aiming to scale such treatments to many more patients with rare diseases. Doudna is one of the inventors of the gene-editing system known as Crispr, and won a Nobel Prize in 2020 for her work on the technology.\n\nAurora plans to take advantage of a new regulatory pathway announced by Food and Drug Administration officials Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad in the fall. The new program, called the “plausible mechanism pathway,” allows the FDA to approve personalized treatments for rare and fatal diseases based on data from just a handful of patients, according to Makary and Prasad in a New England Journal of Medicine article.\n\nTypically, new drugs must be tested in hundreds, if not thousands, of patients in order to get regulatory approval. For drug trials of rare diseases, it’s difficult to recruit that many patients because so few people have the disease. The new FDA pathway provides a way for these types of drugs to be approved when a large, randomized trial isn’t possible.\n\n“Once a manufacturer has demonstrated success with several consecutive patients with different bespoke therapies, the FDA will move toward granting marketing authorization for the product,” Makary and Prasad say in their article. Drug companies will then be able to use data from those patients to get similar drugs approved that are based on the same underlying technology.\n\nThat is key for Aurora, which will initially focus on treating a metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria, or PKU, that’s screened for at birth. The disease leads to toxic levels of phenylalanine, a building block of protein, in the blood. Patients with PKU must eat a highly restrictive low-protein diet. Without early treatment and monitoring, PKU can hinder brain development and impair cognitive functions. An estimated 13,500 people in the US are living with the disease.\n\n“There are a lot of patients that could benefit from this therapy. But the problem is, you have many, many mutations—over a thousand—that cause this disease,” says Edward Kaye, CEO of Aurora Therapeutics and a pediatric neurologist.\n\nCrispr works by using a guide RNA to deliver an editing molecule to a desired location in the genome. The guide RNA is like a car’s GPS—it goes where it’s programmed to go. In the case of baby KJ, scientists built a guide RNA to target his specific genetic mutation. It’s why his treatment only works for him.\n\nAurora’s strategy involves swapping out that guide RNA to make several versions of a PKU therapy that address different mutations. Previously, the FDA would have considered every version a totally new drug, each requiring its own clinical trial. But now, Aurora will be able to use the same technology platform to treat many mutations that cause PKU with less regulatory red tape.\n\nKaye says the company will use base editing, a more precise form of Crispr, and will have a standardized process to streamline the design and manufacturing of its therapies.\n\n“We are very much about no mutation left behind,” says Fyodor Urnov, Aurora’s cofounder and a genome editing scientist at UC Berkeley. Urnov and several of his colleagues at Berkeley’s Innovative Genomics Institute, which Doudna established in 2015, were involved in designing baby KJ’s treatment.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T11:28:55.259370"}

A computer, but a body?\n\nBut for the marketing architects, it’s the latest term of art, a buzzword meant to point us citizens toward a bright and promising technological future.\n\nBack here on earth, the term is maybe most useful as a way to understand how automotive companies are thinking about themselves right now: as tech pioneers. It’s also a handy shortcut to understanding how appetizing the automotive industry is for the companies that make chips—what could be a $123 billion opportunity by 2032, up some 85 percent from 2023. The giant CES consumer tech showcase that just took place in Las Vegas always has its share of goofy robot demos, but this year’s presentations showed how the world of robots, cars, and chipsets are growing ever closer.\n\nFirst, to define (marketing) terms: “Physical AI” is the way tech developers eventually hope that autonomous systems interact with the real world, by using camera and sensor data to truly understand and reason through what’s going on around them, and perform complex tasks to respond. Physical AI is humanoid robots putting in a day’s work on the Hyundai factory floor, as Google DeepMind, Boston Dynamics, and the Korean automaker announced they would do in the coming months. It’s a car driving itself in complex traffic situations, or taking an arguably more complicated job: seamlessly handing off control between a human driver and a software-powered one. Physical AI lets autonomous systems like cameras, robots, and self-driving cars perceive, understand, reason, and perform or orchestrate complicated actions in the real world.\n\nIt is no accident that the companies making the loudest noise about physical AI are chipmakers, including Nvidia and ARM. The former announced a whole new open source line of AI models targeting autonomous systems; the latter debuted a Physical AI division at CES. They stand to make a chunk of change off the trend.\n\nWitness, for example, the parade of autonomy-related announcements at CES, which will all require some powerful computing resources onboard.\n\nFord says it will sell a system that allows drivers to operate their vehicles without looking at the road in front of them by 2028. The Afeela, a battery-powered collaboration between Sony and Honda, will drive by itself in most situations at some point, date TBD. Nvidia will supply the chips for Chinese automaker Geely’s new “intelligent driving system,” which will eventually transition to what the company calls “high-level autonomous driving.” Nvidia is also involved in Mercedes-Benz’s new hands-off driving system, to debut in the US this year. Eventually, the company says the system should be able to drive between home and work without help. “This is already a giant business for us,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said of self-driving cars during his CES presentation.\n\n“The central brain of the vehicle will now be quantum leaps bigger—hundreds of times as big—and that’s what [chipmakers] are selling into,” says Mark Wakefield, the global automotive market lead at consultancy AlixPartners. “They see a big future in these vehicles.”\n\nNo wonder their marketers found a sexy new way to describe it.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T11:46:30.359653"}

The show has once again delivered an avalanche of products, both innovative and vaporous, that will shape the industry in 2026.\n\nThe Verge’s team has been working around the clock to share the experience. Some of it wowed us while some of it weirded us out, but that’s part of the fun of CES.\n\nAfter taking it all in over the past week, there are some gadgets that stood out from the rest. They innovated on an existing product, entirely rethought a category, or delivered something so delightful or dumb that we just had to share. These are the things that deserve to be recognized — our best of CES 2026.\n\nBest monitor\n\nPhoto: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nSamsung screens have dominated The Verge Awards at CES four years in a row, but it’s LG Display’s time to shine again.\n\nBoth companies have finally managed to produce gorgeous high-refresh-rate OLED panels whose pixels contain the proper number of linearly repeating red, green, and blue components to clearly render text — addressing the annoying color fringing that can sometimes make text hard to read on previous-gen OLED screens.\n\nBut after looking at LG Display’s and Samsung Display’s screens in back-to-back appointments, Verge display expert John Higgins and I had to give LG Display the edge. With 4K resolution at 27 inches, text and gaming graphics were both incredibly sharp and easy on the eyes. It’s also a dual-mode 4K 240Hz or 1080p 480Hz panel, so you can switch to an even higher refresh rate.\n\nIt’s not the brightest or highest-resolution screen we saw at CES, where brilliant 5K 1,500-nit monitors were also on display — this one has 1,000-nit peaks — but it’s the one I’d pick for work and play. Asus might be one of the first to use it in the ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, which’ll have DisplayPort 2.1a, HDMI 2.1, and a 90W USB-C port so you can dock and charge a laptop, but it didn’t share price or availability. — Sean Hollister, senior editor\n\nBest keyboard\n\nImage: Corsair\n\nThere are always a lot of cool keyboards at CES. This year might be one of the best, if only because among all of the new, interesting models was Corsair’s $350 Galleon 100 SD that’ll be available later this month. It’s a full-size wired mechanical keyboard that just so happens to have a Stream Deck built in. Its greatest feat is that it manages to not look like a botched experiment.\n\nWhile part of the Stream Deck’s appeal comes from the fact that it’s typically sold as a peripheral, set off to the side on your desk where you can easily reach it to mute your mic, launch an app, or configure your smart lights, it looks and feels right at home fused into this keyboard. This particular hardware is closest to a Stream Deck Plus, with a screen, two rotary knobs, and 12 buttons, each of which can be customized however you’d like via Elgato’s vast marketplace of app plug-ins, icons, sounds, and more.\n\nThe Galleon looks cutting-edge, although the keyboard aspect doesn’t necessarily stand out compared to many models already available. It has Corsair’s own mechanical switches, a hot-swappable PCB, up to 8,000Hz polling rate, and it can be configured in the company’s browser-based utility, negating the need for a software download. I’m actually using the Galleon to type this, and I don’t have much to complain about so far. — Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor\n\nBest TV\n\nImage: TCL\n\nTCL made a bold move for CES 2026. Instead of focusing mainly on RGB LEDs like its competitors, it instead went all in on its new X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, which uses blue LEDs like the mini-LED TVs we’re familiar with. But there are two major improvements TCL made that set it apart, and that you won’t find on any other TV this year.\n\nThe X11L uses reformulated quantum dots that provide more color and an upgraded color filter TCL calls UltraColor Filter that delivers more accurate color. The two combine to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space. It’s an innovation that I expect will eventually filter into other, more affordable models — both from TCL and other manufacturers. In addition to the vibrant colors, the X11L is capable of reaching 10,000 nits of peak brightness and has up to 20,000 dimming zones.\n\nThe innovation doesn’t come cheap, with the smallest X11L at 75 inches going for $6,999.99, but by the end of the year, it will very possibly be almost half that price. — John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer\n\nBest laptop\n\nAsus is back for round two with its ROG Zephyrus Duo dual-screen gaming laptop, and I think this one could be a real knockout. The new Duo has two matching edge-to-edge 16-inch OLED displays, up to RTX 5090 graphics, an Intel Panther Lake processor, and a removable wireless keyboard / trackpad deck. It’s a clamshell laptop, a top-and-bottom or side-by-side multiscreen setup, and even a tented convertible all-in-one machine. Dual-screen laptops are nerdy fun, but I’ve seen firsthand how handy they are for productivity in my time testing the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. Taking that power-user formula to a gaming laptop seems like a recipe for success in my book.\n\nWe sadly still don’t know the price of the new Zephyrus Duo — just that it’s due out in Q2 2026. Dual-screen laptops will always be a pricier niche, and I’m afraid it’s gonna be really up there; especially with two large OLEDs and the ongoing RAM shortage. Here’s to hoping the premium over the Zephyrus G16 it’s based on isn’t astronomical, because it looks awesome. I can’t wait to review it and see how I can simultaneously mix work and play on its lovely dual displays. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer\n\nBest smart home device\n\nImage: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\n\nBut the standout was the Aqara Smart Lock U400 — not because of any particular innovation on Aqara’s part. It’s a fairly standard-looking smart lock. Rather, it represents how open standards, interoperability, and some genuinely cool technology are making the smart home smarter and easier to use.\n\nThe first smart lock to support Apple’s hands-free Home Key unlocking using ultra-wideband technology, the U400 can securely unlock as you approach with your phone in your pocket or your Apple Watch on your wrist. As a Matter-over-Thread device, it can work with any Matter-compatible smart home platform, including Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Home Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings.\n\nWhile this magical hands-free unlocking experience (I tested the lock ahead of CES and it works very well) is currently limited to Apple, the U400 is Aliro-ready. Aliro is a smart lock standard developed by Apple, Samsung, Google, and lock and chip makers that will bring Home Key-style hands-free unlocking — along with NFC tap-to-unlock — to Android phones and watches. That’s a meaningful step toward solving the fragmentation and ecosystem lock-in that has long plagued the smart home. — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, senior smart home reviewer\n\nBest car\n\nImage: Mercedes\n\nMy pick for best car at CES was kind of a no-brainer, because it was the only thing real enough for us to test ourselves. That would be Mercedes’ Drive Assist Pro, which is a Level 2 partially autonomous driver assist feature for city driving as well as highways.\n\nThe system is powered by five radar sensors, 10 cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. And all that sensor data is shoveled into a supercomputer from Nvidia that is capable of running up to 508 trillion operations a second.\n\nI went on a test ride through San Francisco and was pretty impressed with how the system handled all the chaos of a crowded city. There were bike messengers, double-parked cars, delivery trucks, and people pushing baby strollers, and the Mercedes navigated all of it pretty effortlessly. It’s not a fully autonomous system yet, and the driver still needs to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. But you can see how those restrictions could eventually be lifted if Mercedes decides it’s safe enough to do so.\n\nThink of it as Mercedes’ answer to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving, but arguably a lot more robust thanks to all those extra sensors. In my opinion it beats Tesla’s camera-only approach just in terms of redundancy. Also it’s backed by Nvidia’s safety-certified silicon chips and AI software, all of which are going into a lot more cars in the years to come. — Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor\n\nBest health tech\n\nImage: Withings\n\nThis year’s show was all about longevity tech, and some pretty cursed ways to tackle that concept. Mostly involving several bodily fluids and inconvenient tests. The Withings Body Scan 2, however, is a scale, and everyone knows how to use a scale.\n\nThe interesting thing: Withings is positioning this device less as a scale and more as a “longevity station.” It measures over 60 biomarkers, concentrating on cardiovascular and non-invasive metabolic health. It does the latter by measuring minuscule amounts of foot sweat. (And while technically foot sweat is a bodily fluid, I’ll take that over urine or blood.)\n\nMore so than the fancy metrics, what I like here is the concept of decentering weight from the entire purpose of a scale. It’s encouraging users to view their weight as one part of their health — not the entire measure. My only gripe is that the scale will cost a whopping $600, but hopefully the price for this kind of tech comes down over time. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer\n\nBest wearable\n\nPhoto by Owen Grove / The Verge\n\nThis was a ho-hum year for wearables at the show, so I was pleasantly surprised by L’Oréal’s take on an LED face mask — a product category I generally hate. It’s conceptually based on a sheet mask, meaning it’s much easier to wear than the typical, Jason Voorhees-esque LED masks you’ll find on the show floor. It’s made of a flexible, silicone-esque material, and the light sits much closer to your skin. There’s also a smaller version that fits just under the eyes. The flexible material also means that, down the line, you could see this technology applied to other body parts, such as the neck or decolletage. Plus, you only have to wear it for five to 10 minutes.\n\nWhat I appreciate about this mask is that L’Oréal has disclosed it uses 630nm and 830nm wavelengths, and that it’s going through the extra hoops of 510(k) FDA clearance. No one needs red light therapy masks, and it’s totally fine if you don’t believe it’s a useful therapy. However, the combination of a smarter design, transparent labeling, and regulatory compliance is the type of innovation I want to see in a market that’s rampant with scammy versions of the same gadget. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer\n\nBest hair dryer/lamp\n\nPhoto: Kevin McShane / The Verge\n\nDo I need a giant hair dryer with LEDs? No. But would I use it? Absolutely.\n\nDrying my hair is one of my least favorite activities, and I would love to veg out on the couch or play games at my computer while Dreame’s $700 standing hair dryer does all the work for me. No one even has to know that you have a hair dryer in your living room or office, either; you can just turn on the light, and it becomes a lamp — albeit an excessive one. — Emma Roth, news writer\n\nBest gaming\n\nImage: 8BitDo\n\n8BitDo made a name for itself with affordable but well-featured alternatives to Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo’s often pricey controllers. The company is still very good at that, but with the new Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox, 8BitDo demonstrates it can offer a better product than the console makers and compete with other high-end controller makers.\n\nWhen it launches in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99, the Ultimate 3E will be 8BitDo’s most expensive controller to date, but it delivers plenty of features to justify that price. It’s got drift-resistant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks with reactive LED lighting at their base, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops, two sets of shoulder buttons, motion controls, and four haptic feedback motors. It connects to recent Xbox consoles using an included 2.4GHz dongle, and other devices using Bluetooth or a USB-C cable.\n\nThe Ultimate 3E is also extensively customizable. It works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X so you can remap its controls and adjust the sensitivity of its triggers and sticks. You can swap out its standard joysticks with replacements that are taller or thicker, or upgrade its metal D-pad to one with a circular design. You can even change how the Ultimate 3E’s ABXY buttons feel. They’re all contained in interchangeable button modules featuring either squishy silicone membrane buttons or clicky micro switches. If it’s a premium Xbox controller you’re after, 8BitDo is now worth your consideration. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter\n\nBest phone\n\nPhoto: Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nYou know what’s better than a folding phone? A folding phone that folds again. Yes, it’s almost certainly going to be outrageously expensive. Yes, Huawei already did a trifold. And yes, it’s kind of nonsense to call it a trifold when it only folds twice. But gosh dang it, it’s so cool.\n\nJust to recap: The TriFold is on sale currently in Korea, and Samsung plans to sell it in the US later this year at a to-be-disclosed price. It folds up like a wallet, with a 6.5-inch outer screen for when you want it to be a phone and a massive 10-inch inner screen when you need a tablet. Mostly I’m just impressed that it’s really here. Samsung started hinting at its existence last January at Unpacked; just under a year later, it’s a reality that I was able to touch, hold, and flex.\n\nAnd it’s all the more appealing because, in true Samsung fashion, you can do whatever the hell you want with it. Particularly with the inner screen — it functions like an Android phone by default, but you can put it into DeX mode if you want a more PC-like experience with windowing. – Allison Johnson, senior reviewer\n\nBest audio product\n\nPhoto: Antonio G. Di Benedetto\n\nI’ve listened to a lot of headphones throughout my career, to the point where it sometimes feels like a chore. So when I put a pair on my head and immediately enjoy what I hear, I take notice. From the moment I put the Fender Mix headphones on my head, I knew I had found something special.\n\nThe audio tuning sounded full without being overpowering. The ear cups were cushiony and the headphones had a strong amount of clamping force, but not so much that I got a headache, to keep them securely in place. And they felt well built and durable.\n\nBut the best part about them are the details. By removing one of the ear cups, you can access a door that opens to allow you to change the rechargeable battery if it ever fails. The battery gets you 100 hours of listening time (52 with ANC). And under the other ear cup is a USB-C dongle you can plug into your device to allow it to transmit an Auracast broadcast to the headphones. The headphones support low-latency, lossless, and high-res audio at 24-bit/96kHz. And if your battery runs out, you can connect a cable to the 3.5mm port and listen to them passively.\n\nThe short time I was able to spend with the Fender Mix headphones was one of the highlights of my CES. — John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer\n\nBest robot\n\nImage: Andru Marino / The Verge\n\nIt was the year of the robot at CES, with Boston Dynamics’ Atlas and LG’s CLOiD making their Las Vegas debuts alongside hundreds of humanoid bots hanging around every booth.\n\nBut while some of these robots gave (somewhat) impressive demos and hinted at a more compelling narrative as to how they could one day be useful in our homes, it’s clear that the Rosie the Robot-style home helper is still firmly part of science fiction.\n\nInstead, the best robot at CES was the one that simply climbed the stairs and cleaned them.\n\nRobot vacuum maker Roborock debuted the Saros Rover, the world’s first robot vacuum that can both climb stairs and clean them. While we’ve seen concepts from Dreame and Eufy featuring track-equipped robots that can haul a vacuum upstairs to clean multiple floors, the Rover takes it a step further.\n\nWith froglike legs on wheels, the Rover methodically tackled a flight of stairs in its CES debut, pivoting on one leg at each step as it vacuumed along the treads. The Rover is still a concept product with no price or release date, but stairs have been the final frontier for these popular home-cleaning robots — and it looks like Roborock just conquered them. — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, senior smart home reviewer\n\nBest surprise\n\nSurprise! This fairly thin, unassuming office keyboard from HP is actually a desktop computer. Inside is an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series processor, RAM, storage, a fan, stereo speakers, and mics — it’s the full package. It even comes with a pre-paired Bluetooth mouse and options for a user-replaceable battery and fingerprint reader embedded in the power button. You just need to plug into a monitor delivering power via USB-C.\n\nIt’s surprisingly fun and quirky for a device designed for dull enterprise and IT duties. It feels like a throwback to the days of the legendary Commodore 64 with Raspberry Pi 500 DNA sprinkled in, though with a number pad and much more power. A laptop probably makes more sense for most people (even office workers), but the Eliteboard G1a is much more unique. It may not be as nice to type on as the mechanical keyboards I covet so much, but for a latticeless membrane board it ain’t bad. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer\n\nBest promise\n\nImage: Tim Stevens\n\nDonut Lab’s claim to have a solid-state battery ready to go into production raised more than just a few eyebrows at CES this year. After all, a battery that swaps liquid electrolytes for solid material would mean smaller, more energy-dense, more durable, longer-lasting, and less fire-prone batteries. In other words, a potential game changer in the world of electric vehicles. Of course, the landscape is littered with the corpses of companies promising solid-state breakthroughs, so Donut Lab needs to back its claims up with real proof. The company is promising production is imminent, so either way we should know soon enough. — Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor\n\nBest backpedal\n\nPhoto: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nLast year, for the category of “Best new Dell computer name,” we awarded no winners because of Dell’s baffling decision to kill the XPS brand in favor of generic monikers like Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. This year, thankfully, Dell ate some humble pie and brought XPS back, even putting the XPS brand on the lid of the laptops.\n\nDell Pro is still around, but we can deal with that now that XPS has returned. — Jay Peters, senior reporter\n\nBest use of E Ink\n\nImage: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nThere were more digital picture frames using E Ink’s advanced color e-paper screen tech debuting at CES this year, but SwitchBot finding an alternate use for the black-and-white E Ink panels typically found in e-readers impressed us more. As the name implies, the SwitchBot Weather Station focuses on providing a wealth of weather-related info for both inside and outside your home using built-in sensors and downloaded data. Its simplicity is its biggest appeal.\n\nIt’s all displayed on a 7.5-inch E Ink monochromatic screen that’s wrapped in a basic black frame you can prop up on a table or hang on a wall. Pricing and availability aren’t known yet, but the Weather Station can also display calendar data synced from various platforms, and offers limited control of your smart home through the SwitchBot Hub. As with a lot of devices announced at CES 2026, the Weather Station has some AI-powered features, too, but they’re limited to offering weather-related insights and aspirational quotes that could help get you through a dreary day. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter\n\nBest thing we’d actually buy\n\nThere’s no shortage of cheap Bluetooth speakers on the market — Amazon is flooded with them — but they’re always a gamble. Will they sound okay? Will their rechargeable battery be safe? Will their wireless connection be reliable? Last November Ikea introduced a new collection of colorful Bluetooth speakers that can double as home decor, but at CES it announced a much smaller alternative that’s priced to be an impulse purchase. The next time we stop by for meatballs and cheap bookshelves, we’re probably going to be walking out of an Ikea warehouse with an armful of its new Kallsup Bluetooth speakers.\n\nAvailable in white, pink, and lime green color options when it launches in April 2026, the Kallsup is a tiny $10 cube speaker with “powerful sound,” according to The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, who had a chance to try them out at the show. If one isn’t loud enough, you can pair and sync up to 100 Kallsups to fill a larger space with sound. Battery life is expected to be up to nine hours at half volume on a full charge, and the battery is user-replaceable so you’re not left with e-waste when it stops taking a charge.\n\nThere’s a long list of gadgets announced at CES 2026 that The Verge’s staff wants, but the Kallsup is the one device we’re probably all going to actually buy. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter\n\nBest concept\n\nLenovo’s ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 was our best in show last year because it was a one-of-a-kind rollable laptop you’d soon be able to own. I really, really hope we’ll be able to soon say the same for Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept. It takes the rollable OLED formula and extends it horizontally instead of vertically, now attached to a beefy gaming laptop. It’s what I’ve wanted since I saw Lenovo’s first rollable proof of concept back in 2023.\n\nWhat starts out as a conventional 16-inch, 16:10 gaming laptop extends to a 24-inch ultrawide, with a 21.5-inch middle-ground option for good measure. Lenovo didn’t have any games on the laptop for us to test (for shame, Lenovo), but I’ve tested the Legion Pro 7i that the rollable concept is based on, and I liked it enough to give it a nod in our gaming laptop buying guide. Lenovo just needs to make this thing a reality now. If executed well, like in the ThinkBook rollable, this could be the perfect gaming laptop. And it’d be great for multi-monitor-like productivity, too. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer\n\nMost “of course they made that”\n\nImage: Fraimic\n\nHave you ever looked at AI art and thought, “Boy oh boy, I wish I could frame that slop right up and stick it on the wall”?\n\nWell, you’re in luck.\n\nFraimic is just one of a few companies at CES showing off digital E Ink picture frames designed to display AI-generated art, a concept I’d never considered before this week but which is immediately, painfully obvious in retrospect. Of course someone made this.\n\nWhat makes Fraimic unique in the space is the built-in microphone and voice controls, so you only need talk to the frame to tell it to generate whatever fresh slop your heart desires. It comes in two sizes, priced at either $399 or $999, which includes 100 image generations per year. You can buy more, and the company says it’s considering a $79.99-per-month subscription with unlimited generations — what a bargain.\n\nThe best thing about Fraimic, and alternatives from the likes of SwitchBot and KoKonna, is that you can ignore the AI element entirely and just display your own pictures and photos instead. At that point you’re looking at a decent-quality E Ink Spectra 6 digital picture frame that doesn’t need to be plugged in and runs for years on a single charge. That we can get behind. — Dominic Preston, news editor\n\nMost irrationally loved product\n\nImage: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\n“What else can it do?”\n\nThat was the first question Verge video producer Victoria Barrios had on seeing LilMilo in action, to which the answer is a resounding “nothing.” And yet… don’t you kind of want one anyway?\n\nCES has been stuffed to the brim with AI companions and toys this year, and LilMilo — from robot vacuum manufacturer Ecovacs, of all companies — is one of a wave that can only do one thing, and one thing only: sit around and look cute.\n\nBut look how cute it is! While other companies have opted for cuddly aliens and Totoro-inspired critters, Ecovacs has simply done its best to make a fluffy little pup, and it’s done remarkably well. LilMilo has soft fur and little black toe beans, and thanks to a camera and microphone, it can react to your presence, maintain eye contact, and recognize its owner, supposedly developing its own unique personality over time.\n\nI’m more comfortable with AI toys that do this little than I am with the ones that stuff ChatGPT in a teddy bear and hope for the best. But what’s really impressive about LilMilo is that it really does feel strangely alive, an effect only let down by the unsettlingly human eyes. I instinctively gave the little guy the same pets and scritches I usually do my cats, and felt an affection that I know has no rational basis whatsoever.\n\nEcovacs hasn’t confirmed how much LilMilo might cost if and when it launches, and you probably shouldn’t buy one either way — again, it really doesn’t actually do anything. But do you even have to when you look this stinkin’ cute? — Dominic Preston, news editor\n\nMost fun\n\nMinVerse\n\nImage: Owen Grove\n\nI found my favorite thing I’ve ever tried in my four years of attending CES. For me, this year’s CES was a blur of robots that don’t work, vacuums, lawnmowers, and AI chatbots shoved into just about anything. It was a welcome surprise when I stumbled across the booth for Haply, a company that makes haptic controllers for interacting with 3D objects. Haply’s booth showed off a variety of demos, like articulated robot arms that you could control with enough precision to play a real game of Operation, physics demos where you had to push your controller through a gelatinous, spongy 3D object on a screen, and 3D modeling software where you could mold and shape clay.\n\nWhat really surprised me was how much I could feel the objects and their textures through the screen with these controllers, especially its consumer-priced 3D haptics mouse, MinVerse. I used MinVerse briefly in a 3D software application I’ve never used before called Geomagic Freeform and instantly felt comfortable using it because of how tactile the controls were. I’ve dabbled in 3D modeling before as a hobby, but largely gave up on it because typical mice and tablet workflows made the process so cumbersome. 3D sculpting tools were the exact kind of thing I’d always wanted to try but found way too expensive to ever consider, with ranges from $3,000 to $15,000. MinVerse is priced at $1,500, and the company intends to push for further API integration with more affordable programs like Blender, ZBrush, and Maya. While it’s still a hefty cost for a hobbyist, I’m inspired to try 3D modeling again knowing that this tool is out there. — Owen Grove, video director\n\nBest sequel\n\nImage: Birdbuddy\n\nIn between the flashy new TVs, a laptop with a rolling display, and a smartphone that folds in three ways is the Birdbuddy 2. It’s the successor to the smart bird feeder that Birdbuddy launched as part of a Kickstarter campaign in 2020, and now it’s back with a new model that builds upon all the best parts of the Birdbuddy Pro.\n\nThe Birdbuddy 2 comes with a circular camera housing in the center of the feeder, encapsulating a sensor capable of recording 2K HDR video in a wider 135-degree field of view. The device can capture your feathered visitors in both landscape and portrait mode based on the orientation you choose by physically rotating the camera. It can also record in slow motion, similar to Birdbuddy’s smart hummingbird feeder.\n\nThe company claims that the Birdbuddy 2 is supposed to start recording as soon as birds land on the feeder. That sounds like a pretty exciting improvement on its own, as I often find myself missing a bird’s initial arrival when reviewing clips from my Birdfy smart feeder. But a better camera isn’t the only upgrade coming to the Birdbuddy 2. The feeder can hold a larger six-cup capacity of bird food and even comes with roof-mounted solar panels, so you don’t have to bring it inside to charge. It’s priced at $199 and is a great upgrade from Birdbuddy’s previous feeders. — Emma Roth, news writer\n\nThing I want to try the most\n\nClicks’ keyboard cases never really appealed to me; as much as I have wanted to mess around with Clicks’ physical keys, I didn’t want to slot my phone into an extra-long case. (My phone is long enough!) But the Clicks Power Keyboard, which puts the keyboard on a magnetic power bank so I can more easily take it on and off my phone? That is something I’m willing to try.\n\nThe double-duty nature of the device? Super useful. Sliding up my phone to access the keyboard? New fidget toy. The ability to use the keyboard in portrait and landscape mode? Yes please! Bluetooth connectivity, meaning I can use the keyboard even if the bank isn’t attached to my phone? That’s handy. And because it’s a power bank, I can bring it between phones as needed instead of having to buy a whole new bespoke case.\n\nPlus, those physical keys look so dang fun. — Jay Peters, senior reporter\n\nBest in show\n\nPhoto by Kevin McShane / The Verge\n\nI never would’ve imagined a Lego brick taking home our biggest award at the Consumer Electronics Show, and I say that as a diehard Lego fan. The toymaker hasn’t come to CES for nearly a decade, and we typically give Best in Show to a stunning new screen or chip or a technology that will impact the industry for years.\n\nBut nothing has captured attention at CES quite like the Lego Smart Brick. My colleagues agree: It’s a breath of fresh air. An AI-free product at a show filled with AI cringe. An idea that seems more compelling when you look deeper, not less. A real product with a real price coming this March, not a concept or prototype. And it was genuinely fun to play with!\n\nWhen you drop one of these Smart Bricks on a Lego creation, it becomes whatever Lego’s nearby smart NFC tags and figures tell it to become. It can be a spaceship that swoops and soars and refuels and plays a blasting minigame with other ships nearby. It can be a musical instrument that plays certain tunes, a birthday cake whose candles you blow out. It can be a car that accelerates and swerves and crashes and sounds alarms if a bad guy tries to nab it. It can be a Lego creature that purrs when you stroke its back. It can simultaneously roleplay the characters that drive the cars and ships, having them react to a kid’s actions.\n\nKids can mix and match and combine the smarts with normal Lego bricks, repurposing the same lights and sounds and minigames the toymaker has devised for their own creations — powering up any Lego spaceship they build by using the Star Wars X-wing tag, or building a helicopter that quacks like a duck.\n\nAnd it sure sounds like these Smart Bricks won’t just be for kids. The company touts them as its biggest innovation since the minifigure in 1978, and rumor has it that Lego Pokémon will be the next to feature them. — Sean Hollister, senior editor", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T07:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T12:57:13.431872"}

Critics Say They’re Unconstitutional", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/conservative-lawmakers-want-porn-taxes-critics-say-theyre-unconstitutional/", "summary": "Alabama passed a 10 percent porn tax last year, as Utah and Pennsylvania eye similar bills. Half the country has enacted age-verification laws to prevent minors from viewing porn.", "content": "As age-verification laws continue to dismantle the adult industry—and determine the future of free speech on the internet—a Utah lawmaker proposed a bill this week that would enforce a tax on porn sites that operate within the state.\n\nIntroduced by state senator Calvin Musselman, a Republican, the bill would impose a 7 percent tax on total receipts “from sales, distributions, memberships, subscriptions, performances, and content amounting to material harmful to minors that is produced, sold, filmed, generated, or otherwise based” in Utah. If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. Per the legislation, the money made from the tax will be used by Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to provide more mental health support for teens.\n\nMusselman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA new age of American conservatism commands the political arena, and more US lawmakers are calling for additional restrictions on adult content. In September, Alabama became the first state to impose a porn tax on adult entertainment companies (10 percent) following the passage of age-verification mandates, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content. Pennsylvania lawmakers are also eyeing a bill that would tax consumers an additional 10 percent on “subscriptions to and one-time purchases from online adult content platforms,” despite already requiring them to pay a 6 percent sales and use tax for the purchase of digital products, two state senators wrote in a memo in October. Other states have flirted with the idea of a porn tax in the past. In 2019, Arizona state senator Gail Griffin, a Republican, proposed taxing adult content distributors to help fund the border wall, a key priority during Donald Trump’s first presidential term. So far, 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.\n\nAlthough efforts to criminalize participants in the sex work industry have been ongoing for years—with new regulations unfolding at a moment of heightened online surveillance and censorship—targeted taxes have failed to gain widespread approval because the legality around such laws are up for debate.\n\n“This kind of porn tax is blatantly unconstitutional,” says Evelyn Douek, an associate professor of law at Stanford Law School. “It singles out a particular type of protected speech for disfavored treatment, purely because the legislature doesn’t like it—that’s exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect against. Utah may not like porn, but as the Supreme Court affirmed only last year, adults have a fully protected right to access it.”\n\nUtah, Alabama, and Pennsylvania are among the 16 states that have adopted resolutions declaring porn a public health crisis. “We realize this is a bold assertion not everyone will agree on, but it’s the full-fledged truth,” Utah governor Gary Herbert tweeted in 2016 after signing the resolution. One of Utah’s earliest statewide responses to the proliferation of adult content happened in 2001, when it became the first state to create an office for sexually explicit issues by hiring an obscenity and pornography complaints ombudsman. The position—dubbed the “porn czar”—was terminated in 2017.\n\n“Age restriction is a very complex subject that brings with it data privacy concerns and the potential for uneven and inconsistent application for different digital platforms,” Alex Kekesi, vice president of brand and community at Pornhub, told WIRED in a previous conversation. In November, the company urged Google, Microsoft, and Apple to enact device-based verification in their app stores and across their operating systems. “We have seen several states and countries try to impose platform-level age verification requirements, and they have all failed to adequately protect children.” To comply with the new age gate mandates, Pornhub has currently blocked access to users in 23 states.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T12:57:13.927456"}

As of this writing, it no longer generates images as @grok replies for free, but Grok’s image editing tools remain readily available for any X user to churn out images, both sexualized and tame.\n\nX users were previously able to ask Grok – by tagging @grok in a tweet – to edit or create images on the platform by tagging it in a post. Users now attempting this are met with an automated response from the chatbot’s account, telling them that “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” The reply includes a link encouraging them to subscribe to X’s paid programs “to unlock these features.”\n\nBrian is not a subscriber so Grok won’t generate images anymore in response to @grok queries.\n\nThe message gives the impression that only paid X users can edit or create images using Grok. That message is reinforced in the many headlines circulating right now stating that xAI, another Musk company that makes Grok, has restricted Grok’s image editing abilities to this select group of users. But that impression is false. All X users — including free ones — can still use Grok to edit and create images, including the sexually suggestive deepfakes that landed Grok in hot water to begin with.\n\nInteracting with Grok through replies on X is just one of several ways to use the AI chatbot. For example, the “Edit image” button still invokes Grok on every image displayed on X’s desktop website, and that same button can be accessed on the X app by long-pressing on any image. Grok can also be accessed through a standalone website or app, as well as via a highly promoted tab in the X apps and X website. These remain readily available to free users, and require no additional effort compared to the @grok command.\n\nThe Verge tested the Grok website, app, and X tab with free accounts and Grok readily complied with our requests to edit or generate a variety of images, including a full “nudify” and one of Musk wearing a bikini.\n\nThis “Edit image” button is available on every image on X’s desktop website, and yes, it will still undress anyone. Image: Jess Weatherbed / The Verge and Grok The same tool is also available on the X mobile apps if you hold down on any image. It’s like X isn’t actually trying to block the feature. Image: Jess Weatherbed / The Verge and Grok\n\nThe restrictions on X come after Grok has been used to generate sexual images primarily of women, many of them real, as well as minors. Much of this landed on X, which the Financial Times dubbed “the deepfake porn site formerly known as Twitter.” The deepfake undressings, as well as other sexual material, have outraged regulators worldwide, who have threatened to take action against X, though the deepfakes may fall into something of a legal void.\n\nMusk and xAI have also threatened to take action against users who create illegal content using Grok, rather than ensuring that guardrails exist to make it impossible to create it in the first place.\n\nX’s approach — limiting access rather than constraining use — contrasts with the approach taken by other AI companies like Google and OpenAI, which tend to impose strict guardrails on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT, rather than allow free rein for those who pay. Musk has reportedly opposed stricter guardrails personally, and several members of xAI’s already sparse safety team reportedly quit in the lead up to the deluge of digital undressings.\n\nX did not respond to The Verge’s request for comment.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T08:09:54-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T13:43:00.900113"}

Shortly after I saw it, I had the terrible realization that there were multiple people in the clip holding their phones up — another angle was bound to surface. Within minutes, a second video was all over social media, and it was even more horrifying. In another recording, seemingly made by a neighbor, a man approaches to render aid. As armed agents rush toward him with guns, he shouts, “I’m a physician!” You can also hear someone sobbing just outside the frame: “That’s my wife!”\n\nMuch of America has now seen the first few seconds of this video obtained by the Minnesota Reformer. ICE agents lean over a vehicle that is slowly pulling out of the street of what appears to be a residential neighborhood. Three shots ring out. The car accelerates and crashes into a line of parked cars. (You don’t need a Bellingcat top-down reconstruction of the event to see that the ICE agents were nowhere in the pathway of the vehicle, but they’ve made one anyway.)\n\nThe full video is over four minutes long, and it’s the other portions that have burned themselves into my brain.\n\nThroughout those four minutes, almost every civilian — dressed in puffy coats and plaid flannel and fluffy knits — eventually takes their phone out to record. They are filming the cars, ICE agents, each other. One woman is walking her dog on the sidewalk at the start. She appears again to ask, “What’s happening?” to the filmer; later, she shows up in the periphery, this time with her phone out.\n\nAll of these people know someone has been shot by armed, masked thugs who have been authorized to act with total impunity. The deployed airbag of the crashed car is splattered with red. There is blood on the ice. But the civilians still refuse to leave. They are putting their lives on the line because they believe witnessing reality is important.\n\nThe deceased victim — 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good — has been identified as a legal observer. The cacophony of whistles at the start of one video suggests that several activists and legal observers had descended on the scene of an ICE raid, the former to alert the neighborhood and the latter to record what they were doing.\n\nThe immediate response of the Trump administration was to call the victim a domestic terrorist, even before her name was known. Inside the propagandized filter bubbles of Truth Social and X, a single, grainy 13-second clip is being promoted by President Donald Trump as the canonical record of the killing; the countless other videos and eyewitness testimonies are being dismissed. But even this Trump-endorsed clip is, at best, ambiguous. The Trump administration, Mia Sato writes, “is asking the public to disbelieve their own eyes, despite mounting contradictory evidence. Who needs AI manipulations when your preferred angle will do the job well enough?”\n\nReality refuses to go quietly into the night\n\nBut reality refuses to go quietly into the night. Instead of silencing dissent, the shooting has left Minnesota-nice in tatters. On television, the mayor says: “To ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis.” When reporters ask Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) why she thinks the Trump administration is targeting Minnesota, she tells them, “I wish I knew. I mean, I wish they would just leave us the fuck alone.”\n\nJust as the shots ring out, a person filming screams, “Shame! Shame! Oh my fucking God! What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck did you just do?” In all of the extended videos of the shooting, you can hear the furious howls of residents as their boots crunch through the snow. “Don’t let the murderer get away!” they shout. Another cry in the distance: “Murderer!” (The ICE agent, who is masked, then gets into a car and does in fact get away.) But the entire neighborhood keeps screaming: “Murderer! Murderer!” and “Pussy motherfuckers, man!” and “You’re killing my neighbors, you’re stealing my neighbors, what the fuck, man!”\n\nRenee Good and other legal observers came to record what they genuinely believe to be an atrocity: the violent snatching of their immigrant neighbors by masked ICE agents. The whistles, the car honks, the hurriedly captured smartphone videos: These are acts of faith in shared reality, in community, and in due process. They believe that these things — eroded as they are — are worth fighting for.\n\nIt’s doubtful that the shooting will deter anti-ICE resistance. The observers, I fear, will now go out in twos and threes, ready to record not just the ICE kidnappings, but also, potentially, each other’s deaths.\n\nThe tech CEOs, venture capitalists, social media platforms, AI features being rammed into software and hardware alike are all abetting the president of the United States in his war on reality.

The haul represents over 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the United States in 2025, according to firm co-founder Ben Horowitz, but even more jaw-dropping is that it brings the organization to more than $90 billion in assets under management, putting it neck-and-neck with Sequoia Capital as among the largest venture firms in the world. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe firm, which employs approximately hundreds of people across five offices – three in California, plus New York and Washington D.C. – has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. In December, it opened its first Asia office in Seoul for its crypto practice.\n\nThat newly committed capital breaks down across five funds: $6.75 billion for growth investments, $1.7 billion each for apps and infrastructure, $1.176 billion for “American Dynamism” (more on that shortly), $700 million for biotech and healthcare, and another $3 billion for other venture strategies. It’s the kind of money that makes you wonder where it all comes from and, more importantly, where it all goes.\n\nThe “where it comes from” question is one the firm has historically declined to answer. When we asked a16z this week about its limited partners and its distributed-to-paid-in capital ratio – the DPI, or how much actual cash the firm has returned to investors over its 16-year history – the firm didn’t respond. What we do know is that CalPERS invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z’s history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don’t really align with the firm’s preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, lists Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Saudi connection isn’t subtle. Back in 2023, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s largest sovereign funds. Horowitz praised Saudi Arabia as a “startup country,” adding that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.”\n\nBut Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an “unpaid intern” at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration – not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Scott Kupor, a16z’s first employee back in 2009, was sworn in as Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management this past summer.\n\nThis matters because a16z’s current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls “American Dynamism” – a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory “in something like 8 days” in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

A16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (Character.AI, among many other portfolio companies).\n\nThe firm has wins to point to. Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. There’s Airbnb (public at over $100 billion), Slack (acquired for $27.7 billion), and GitHub ($7.5 billion to Microsoft). Its portfolio includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there’s less visibility into those numbers.\n\nIn a blog post published Friday morning, Ben Horowitz writes that “as the American leader in Venture Capital, the fate of new technology in the United States rests partly on our shoulders.” It’s the kind of statement certain to cause agita at rival firms, some of which have been around closer to 50 years, compared with the much younger a16z. Horowitz frames a16z’s mission as “ensuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.”\n\nWhether that happens remains to be seen. What’s certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money – $15 billion this time — to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon. That’s quite a pitch, and plainly, it works.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T13:43:01.471497"}

Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication, was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.\n\nInitially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.\n\nX and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week.\n\nThe U.K., the European Union and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country.

The EV2 made its debut at the Brussels Auto Show, where executives touted it as its “most compact” EV to date.\n\nOf course, it was another in a long line of affordable, capable, and impressively designed EVs that won’t be available to US customers — at least not right away. And it arrives at a time when Europeans have many affordable options from which to chose, potentially complicating Kia’s strategy for the EV2.\n\nThe EV2 will come in two trims: a Standard-range version, with 42.2kWh battery pack and 317 km (197 miles) of range based on the WLTP cycle; and a Long-range trim, with 61kWh pack and over 440 km (273 miles) of range. The Standard-range EV2 will accelerate from 0-100 km/s in 8.7 seconds, while the Long-range will do the same in 9.5 seconds.\n\nThe EV2 has a crisp, squared-off profile with sleek surfaces, tall, upright proportions, and signature LED daytime running lights front and rear, in a clear reflection of Kia’s current design direction. When it arrives, it will slot beneath the EV3 and EV4, the latter of which is scheduled to go into production ahead of the EV2. And like the EV3, the EV2 will be built on a scaled-backed version of Hyundai’s Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) platform in order to keep costs down.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11\n\nThat means a 400-volt architecture, rather than an 800-volt one for quicker fast-charging. Kia says both versions of the EVs will fast-charge from 10-80 percent in 30 minutes, which is a bit pokier when compared to 20-25 minutes it takes the EV6 and EV9 to do the same. And in a first for Kia, the EV2 will support both 11kW and 22kW AC charging, in a nod to the predominant form of charging in Europe. The EV2 also supports bidirectional charging, as well as vehicle-to-load and vehicle-to-grid charging.\n\nBut just because the EV2 is small and unluxurious doesn’t mean it won’t have a few bells and whistles. Kia is stocking its new model with a bevy of ADAS features, like adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, as well as remote smart parking, enabling owners to park their vehicles from the outside by using the key fob.\n\nKia says the standard-range model will go into production at its factory in Slovakia starting in February 2026, followed by the longer-range version and GT trims in June 2026. That, plus American car shoppers’ apparent disdain for small cars, means the EV2 is unlikely to go on sale here. It’s a shame, too. Americans would likely respond favorably to a $20,000 EV, as the EV2 is estimated to cost.\n\nImages via Kia", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T09:07:09-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T14:36:50.543588"}

The electric crossovers, SUVs, and pickups from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC will remain on sale, with the rebatteried Chevy Bolt joining their ranks this year.\n\nBut GM says it expects to sell many fewer EVs than once planned.

Optimizer arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 10AM ET. Opt in for Optimizer here.\n\nAt CES 2026 this week, people kept asking me what health tech I was seeing on the show floor. My only answer was this: bodily fluids. As in urine, blood, sweat, and saliva.\n\nWith most people, my response typically got a handful of groans and raised eyebrows. Among insiders, I surprised no one.\n\nCES is ground zero of the wellness Wild West. At Eureka Park and the Venetian Expo, you’ll find dozens of digital health startups hawking everything from smartwatches and smart rings to smart pillows. This isn’t new, per se. Urine tech in particular has always been a staple at the show, but what’s notable this year isn’t simply the presence of this tech — it’s the idea that mining these fluids can help you live longer and healthier.\n\nI wasn’t kidding about sperm microscopes.\n\nHere’s some of what I saw: at-home hormone testing kits using urine and saliva; smart menstrual pads and panty liners; an in-toilet hydration tracker; a mirror that analyzes your facial blood flow to estimate how well you’re aging; a sperm microscope; and a smart scale that analyzes metabolic health through foot sweat.\n\nIt’s not just tiny startups, either. Bigger names in the space are also opening their platforms to accommodate data sources beyond heart rate. At the show, Withings announced it was partnering with Abbott to integrate the latter’s continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). Oura has a similar partnership with Dexcom that was announced in 2025. Whoop also added the ability to get blood panel data integrated into its app last year, followed soon by Oura, and now Ultrahuman is doing the same.\n\nAt the core, this fixation on bodily fluids is evidence that the entire industry is doubling down on metabolic health as the next frontier. Where digital health started with cardiovascular health, the next phase hinges on your metabolism. So after logging tens of thousands of steps on the show floor, I sat down with Oura CEO Tom Hale and Dexcom CEO Jake Leach to talk about where metabolic tech is going, the challenges ahead, and what we’re likely to see as consumers.\n\nThis longevity mirror reads the blood flow in your face and somehow estimates your metabolic health.\n\nBoth said the real balancing act is between finding useful data from additional metrics and the potential to overwhelm people with health anxiety. While people may be fine with step and heart rate data, getting into deeper metabolic insights comes with much more sensitive data. Introducing more advanced detection features — like, say, high blood pressure or glucose alerts — raises the stakes.\n\n“Actually, we don’t need more sensors. We need more sense,” says Hale, who views metabolic insights derived from blood or urine testing as more likely to be episodic than continuous. For Hale, the point is to combine occasional, use-case-driven data with longer-term baseline data.\n\n“You’re trying to solve a certain problem. Maybe you’re going through a super stressful time, and you’re trying to manage your stress because you’re hypertensive. Okay, maybe a cortisol sweat test is really useful, but when you figure that out, are you going to continually measure your cortisol? Probably not.”\n\n“Bringing the data together in one place is really helpful. Having it in disparate places on disparate devices is problematic, but you’ve got to have technology and software surface actual insights and not just, ‘Here’s all these blood markers and here’s where they should be,’” says Leach.\n\nThis is a tale as old as health tech — and one many companies are trying to solve with AI. Hence why you’re starting to see so many companies adding AI-powered nutrition tracking, chatbots, and insights into their apps. Dexcom added AI insights for its Stelo CGM. Oura has also done it. Meanwhile, at CES 2026, Garmin announced it was also adding AI nutrition logging to its app for subscribers.\n\nOn paper, it’s a trend that makes a ton of sense. The reality is that the AI just isn’t there yet. When I push Leach on that, he agrees.\n\nHere’s Vivoo’s $99 hydration tracker that goes in your toilet, and its smart menstrual pad in the upper left.\n\n“We’ve got to push past that, and that is where things are kind of stuck. A technology like CGMs that has such obvious outcomes is a great technology to be pioneering that,” Leach says, noting that there are direct correlations between the lifestyle changes a person makes and how they’re reflected in their glucose readings.\n\nThe other problem, however, is data privacy. Getting blood tests is invasive, and many people currently live in a state of heightened anxiety. It’s a tough time for health tech to ask for more data from its users.\n\nCase in point, Oura — and by extension, Hale — received backlash earlier this summer when Oura was revealed to have a partnership with Palantir and the Defense Department. Users accused the company of selling and sharing user data, forcing Hale to come on social media to refute the accusation. In public statements on social media, Hale stated that Oura never sells or shares user data; the Palantir partnership in question referred to a separate enterprise program. When I press the issue, Hale reiterates this point, adding that users’ menstrual data in particular is off-limits.\n\nMonths later, Hale says “Palantir-gate” didn’t hurt the company much overall, but was a compelling experience. “We weren’t selling anybody’s data, but we learned just how afraid people are about that and how much of a third rail that is.”\n\nWithings’ new scale measures metabolic biomarkers from foot sweat. Feet pictured not mine.\n\nOtherwise, both Leach and Hale pointed to nutrition, blood pressure, and wearable gadget ecosystems as likely trends in the space. Dexcom plans to add macro tracking and a redesigned app later this year. Meanwhile, Hale noted that we might soon start seeing greater integration between smart glasses and food tracking. For example, taking a photo of your meal, getting calorie estimates, and then cross-referencing all that data with your given tracker of choice. Hale also identified chronic condition management as another potential avenue wearables and health tech are starting to explore.\n\n“The wearable space in general is experiencing quite the boom right now, and I think it’s driven by the actual desire of people to live healthier and for healthcare systems to improve their outcomes,” agrees Leach. “Wearable technology is the way we do this at scale, because not every doctor can see every patient all of the time.”\n\nTaking all this in, I don’t think the average Joe is suddenly going to be installing pee collectors in their toilet, going for monthly blood draws, or stepping on $600 scales that tell you how long you’re going to live based on your foot sweat. That would truly be a dystopian 2026. But based on what I saw, and what I heard from Hale and Leach, I do think you’re going to start seeing a larger shift away from basic fitness and more toward this idea of promoting longevity through preventive measures. It’s going to be less about closing your rings every day and more about doing small lifestyle experiments over a few months and tracking any changes. Optimistically, those changes may help prevent or improve common ailments that build up over time, like diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol. Maybe those experiments will involve bodily fluids, maybe not. But clearly, the industry seems to think metabolism is the key to unlocking a healthier you.\n\nUnfortunately, I think that means more bodily fluids.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T15:34:52.141563"}

Experts say it represents the “monetization of abuse”—and anyone can still generate images on Grok’s app and website.", "content": "After creating thousands of “undressing” pictures of women and sexualized imagery of apparent minors, Elon Musk’s X has apparently limited who can generate images with Grok. However, despite the changes, the chatbot is still being used to create “undressing” sexualized images on the platform.\n\nOn Friday morning, the Grok account on X started responding to some users’ requests with a message saying that image generation and editing are “currently limited to paying subscribers.” The message also includes a link pushing people towards the social media platform’s $395 annual subscription tier. In one test of the system requesting Grok create an image of a tree, the system returned the same message.\n\nThe apparent change comes after days of growing outrage against and scrutiny of Musk’s X and xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot. The companies face an increasing number of investigations from regulators around the world over the creation of nonconsensual explicit imagery and alleged sexual images of children. British prime minister Keir Starmer has not ruled out banning X in the country and said the actions have been “unlawful.”\n\nNeither X nor xAI, the Musk-owned company behind Grok, has confirmed that it has made image generation and editing a paid-only feature. An X spokesperson acknowledged WIRED’s inquiry but did not provide comment ahead of publication. X has previously said it takes “action against illegal content on X,” including instances of child sexual abuse material. While Apple and Google have previously banned apps with similar “nudify” features, X and Grok remain available in their respective app stores. xAI did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.\n\nFor more than a week, users on X have been asking the chatbot to edit images of women to remove their clothes—often asking for the image to contain a “string” or “transparent” bikini. While a public feed of images created by Grok contained far fewer results of these “undressing” images on Friday, it still created sexualized images when prompted to by X users with paid for “verified” accounts.\n\n“We observe the same kind of prompt, we observe the same kind of outcome, just fewer than before,” Paul Bouchaud, lead researcher at Paris-based nonprofit AI Forensics, tells WIRED. “The model can continue to generate bikini [images],” they say.\n\nA WIRED review of some Grok posts on Friday morning identified Grok generating images in response to user requests for images that “put her in latex lingerie” and “put her in a plastic bikini and cover her in donut white glaze.” The images appear behind a “content warning” box saying that adult material is displayed.\n\nOn Wednesday, WIRED revealed that Grok’s standalone website and app, which is separate from the version on X, has also been used in recent months to create highly graphic and sometimes violent sexual videos, including celebrities and other real people.

{"title": "Silicon Valley Billionaires Panic Over California’s Proposed Wealth Tax", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/backchannel-silicon-valley-billionaires-california-taxes/", "summary": "Larry Page’s apparent Florida move highlights how seriously the ultra-rich are taking a one-time tax aimed at extreme wealth inequality.", "content": "Did California lose Larry Page? The Google and Alphabet cofounder, who left day-to-day operations in 2019, has seen his net worth soar in the years since—from around $50 billion at the time of his departure to somewhere approximating $260 billion today. (Leaving his job clearly didn’t hurt his wallet.) Last year, a proposed ballot initiative in California threatened billionaires like Page with a one-time 5 percent wealth tax—prompting some of them to consider leaving the state before the end of the year, when the tax, if passed, would retroactively kick in. Page seems to have been one of those defectors; The Wall Street Journal reported that he recently spent more than $170 million on two homes in Miami. The article also indicated his cofounder Sergey Brin also might become a Florida man.\n\nThe Google guys, formerly California icons, are only two of approximately 250 billionaires subject to the plan. It’s not certain whether many of them have departed for Florida, Texas, New Zealand, or a space station. But it is clear that a lot of vocal billionaires and other super rich people are publicly losing their minds about the proposal, which will appear on the November ballot if it garners around 875,000 signatures. Hedge fund magnate Bill Ackman calls it “catastrophic.” Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, boasted that he already pays plenty of taxes, so much so that one year he claims his tax return broke the IRS computer.\n\nStill, when considered as a percentage of income, even the big sums paid by some billionaires are way lower than the tax rates many teachers, accountants, and plumbers pay every year. If Musk, currently worth an estimated $716 billion, had to pay a 5 percent wealth tax, he’d probably manage to scrape by with a $680 billion nest egg—enough to buy Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Mercedes, and still remain the world’s richest person. (In any case, he’s safe from California taxes; a few years ago he moved to Texas.)\n\nCalifornia’s politicians, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are generally opposed to the initiative. A glaring exception is Representative Ro Khanna, who said to WIRED in a statement that he’s on board with “a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.”\n\nKhanna might pay a price for taking on the wealthy and may face a primary challenge backed by oligarch bucks because of it. A safer position for Bay Area politicians is the one taken by San Jose mayor Matt Mahan. He recently posted a tweet stream opposing the bill, saying that if California passed the wealth tax it would be cutting off its nose to spite its face. When I speak to Mahan, he emphasizes the risk of California standing alone in taxing the net worth of billionaires. “It puts at risk our innovation economy that is the real engine of economic growth and opportunity,” he says. (Mahan isn’t super rich, but he is billionaire-adjacent: He once was CEO of a company cofounded by former Facebook president Sean Parker.)\n\nBecause of the mobility of rich people, California does have real worries about the impact of a state wealth tax. Not being a billionaire myself, I find the idea baffling—moving away from one’s ideal home simply to avoid a tax that makes no impact on your living situation seems, to use Mahan’s words, like cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nAlso, I don’t see why an exodus of billionaires necessarily means the end of Silicon Valley as the heart of tech innovation. If you want to become a billionaire, there’s no place better than the Bay Area, with an ecosystem that nurtures innovative businesses. That’s not changing. A few years ago, some tech people moved to Miami, claiming it was going to become the new Silicon Valley. That didn’t happen.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T16:39:51.126775"}

Google’s terms of service say that apps are subject to removal if they fail to bar users from “creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children” or portray kids “in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children.” Apple prohibits apps that are “offensive” or “just plain creepy.” Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether X was in compliance with their policies and whether they planned to remove the app.\n\nFailing to remove X from the app stores would both show a double standard, and undermine the companies’ arguments for their control over the app stores in the first place, the lawmakers write. Both companies removed ICEBlock and Red Dot from their stores following government pressure. The apps were used to anonymously report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. “Unlike Grok’s sickening content generation, these apps were not creating or hosting harmful or illegal content, and yet, based entirely on the Administration’s claims that they posed a risk to immigration enforcers, you removed them from your stores,” the senators wrote.\n\nThey also warned that inaction would “undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.

For example, there are recipes for poisoning projective weapons, and deploying them in battle, in Greek and Roman historical documents, as well as references in Greek mythology and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Chinese warriors over the ages did the same, as did the Gauls and Scythians, and some Native American populations.\n\nArchaeologists have now found traces of a plant-based poison on several 60,000-year-old quartz Stone Age arrowheads found in South Africa, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That would make this the oldest direct evidence of using poisons on projectiles—a cognitively complex hunting strategy—and pushes the timeline for using poison arrows back into the Pleistocene.\n\nThe poisons commonly used could be derived from plants or animals (frogs, beetles, venomous lizards). Plant-based examples include curare, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the victim’s respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation. Oleander, milkweeds, or inee (onaye) contain cardiac glucosides. In Southeast Asia, the sap or juice of seeds from the ancar tree is smeared on arrowheads, which causes paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest thanks to the presence of toxins like strychnine. Several species of aconite are known for their use as arrow poisons in Siberia and northern Japan.\n\nAccording to the authors, up until now, the earliest direct evidence of poisoned arrows dates back to the mid-Holocene. For instance, scientists found traces of toxic glycoside residues on 4,000-year-old bone-tipped arrows recovered from an Egyptian tomb, as well as on bone arrow points from 6,700 years ago excavated from South Africa’s Kruger Cave. The only prior evidence of using poisons for hunting during the Pleistocene is a “poison applicator” found at Border Cave in South Africa, along with a lump of beeswax.\n\nMilk of the poisonous onion\n\nThe authors sampled 10 quartz-backed arrowheads recovered from the Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter site in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The results revealed that five of the 10 tested tips had traces of compounds found in Boophone disticha, aka gifbol (poisonous onion), sometimes called the century plant, which is common throughout South Africa. Various parts of the plant have been used as an analgesic (specifically a volatile oil called eugenol) as well as for poisonous hunting purposes. Its more toxic compounds include buphandrine, crinamidine, and buphanine; the latter is similar in effect to scopolamine and can cause hallucinations, coma, or death.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:49:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T17:03:01.941038"}

The messages are seemingly in response to reporting that people are using Grok to generate thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children each hour.\n\n“Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,” Grok tells users, dropping a link and urging, “you can subscribe to unlock these features.”\n\nHowever, as The Verge pointed out and Ars verified, unsubscribed X users can still use Grok to edit images. X seems to have limited users’ ability to request edits made by replying to Grok while still allowing image edits through the desktop site. App users can access the same feature by long-pressing on any image.\n\nUsing image-editing features without publicly prompting Grok keeps outputs out of the public feed. That means the only issue X has rushed to solve is stopping Grok from directly posting harmful images on the platform.\n\nX declined to comment on whether it’s working to close those loopholes, but it has a history of pushing janky updates since Elon Musk took over the platform formerly known as Twitter. Still, motivated X users can also continue using the standalone Grok app or website to make abusive content for free.\n\nLike images X users can edit without publicly asking Grok, these images aren’t posted publicly to an official X account but are likely to be shared by bad actors—some of whom, according to the BBC, are already promoting allegedly Grok-generated child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) on the dark web.

Startups and existing reactors have benefitted from the race for data center power, though in different ways.\n\nExisting reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.\n\nThe deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.\n\nThe 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.\n\nAs part of the deal, Vistra will also add additional capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nIf Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order.\n\nTerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours.\n\nThe company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.\n\nMeta did not disclose financial terms of the deals.\n\nThe power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid.\n\nCosts for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 17:51:15 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T17:56:16.941515"}

We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts. As usual, we’re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, it’s nowhere to be found at CES 2026.\n\nCES isn’t a big smartphone show, but there have been more new handsets here than I expected.

Trump Mobile didn’t hold a press conference, nor did it reach out to The Verge to set up any meetings at Trump Tower. Searching for “Trump” in the CES exhibitor database shows no results at all — and it’s the same story for Liberty Mobile, the MVNO that Trump Mobile is piggybacking on to provide its network.\n\nIt’s not really a surprise that Trump Mobile isn’t here, of course, nor that it doesn’t want to show off its phone. The T1 Phone is now five months late for its initial August release, with no official announcement from the company about why the phone is so delayed or when it’s actually expected to release.\n\nLas Vegas has a Trump tower, but still no Trump phone. Photo by Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nBut for a phone company so proud of its American values — remember, there are still “American hands behind every device,” even if the T1 Phone is no longer claimed to be made in the US — you might have expected it to take part in the country’s premier tech event. CES is the largest dedicated tech convention held in the United States, with over 142,000 attendees at last year’s show, and its organizer, the Consumer Technology Association, is the trade organization that represents the US tech industry.\n\nTrump Mobile certainly isn’t too small to exhibit at CES, with large sections of the show devoted to minor companies and startups — in smartphones alone, brands like Clicks and the privacy-focused Hiroh have shown their wares in Vegas this week, so the show isn’t limited to industry giants like Motorola and Samsung. And while even small booths at the official show can cost tens of thousands, there are cheaper ways to exhibit, including pre-show events like Showstoppers or Pepcom, and even the option to simply book a hotel suite for the night and invite journalists and other attendees to see your products there.\n\nThe question is: Did Trump Mobile decide that it wouldn’t get enough value from making an appearance at CES?

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe Switch 2 is here: everything you need to know about Nintendo’s new console\n\nIf you choose to get an extra controller for your Nintendo Switch 2, you can spend a lot — and get a lot in return. Buying Nintendo’s own $89 Switch 2 Pro Controller, for instance, will net you the console’s only wireless controller with a 3.5mm headphone jack for private listening, not to mention great-feeling rumble, OS-level rear button customization, and a slick design. It’s not perfect, but it’s the total package.\n\nBut it’d be a disservice to you to call it a day there. There are several third-party offerings that are cheaper, yet don’t make too many compromises in terms of features. I’ve spent time testing a handful of them, including new ones as they release, and there’s a small batch of models that I think will satisfy most people, with a range of styles, prices, and features.\n\nEvery controller I’ve included in this guide is compatible with both the Switch 2 and original Switch (all of them can remotely wake the Switch 2), as well as the PC. Each offering also includes better, longer-lasting joystick technology than you’ll get with Nintendo’s flagship controller; the Switch 2 Pro Controller’s potentiometer-based joysticks are prone to degradation over time, after all, but our picks include either Hall effect or TMR joysticks. I’ve highlighted any controller-specific perks in the blurbs below.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test Switch 2 controllers Collapse I put my pricey Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller away and cycle in each of these candidates for multi-session tests with a mix of games for the Switch 2. I spend time assessing their ergonomics, button location, and the quality of each button press and trigger pull. I also strive to test each controller’s unique functions. Affordability, but with few compromises Collapse Most people would rather spend $89.99 on two games, not a single controller. We sought cheaper alternatives to Nintendo’s fantastic Switch 2 Pro Controller, but we hate compromising on features and quality as much as anyone. We aim to include wireless gamepads that can remotely wake the Switch 2, as well as offerings that feature good-feeling rumble and a few extras, such as amiibo support. Long-lasting comfort Collapse Our top picks are just as comfortable to use as Nintendo’s flagship gamepad — perhaps more comfortable, depending on your taste. We’ve included picks with Xbox- and PlayStation-style stick layouts, as well as one that feels similar to the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. Better internal hardware Collapse Nintendo opted for potentiometer-based joysticks with its pricey Switch 2 controller, which may result in “stick drift” later on, if its last-gen controller tech is anything to go by. Every pick in this guide builds upon that technology with either Hall effect or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, which are drift-resistant by design.\n\nThe best Switch 2 controller for most people\n\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes, two / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 1,200mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes\n\nThe EasySMX S10 is nearly as capable and comfortable as the Switch 2 Pro Controller, yet it’s $30 cheaper at its retail price of $59.99. It’s full of surprises, too, including the best adaptation of Nintendo’s HD rumble that I’ve felt in a third-party controller. It’s also one of the few options that can remotely wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode via Bluetooth. Lastly, it includes amiibo support — another rare feature to find in a third-party gamepad.\n\nHowever, the S10 isn’t a Switch 2 Pro copycat; it’s a lot grippier, both around the grips themselves and on its stick caps. Button presses and trigger pulls feel different from most other controllers, too, yielding a softer press and shorter travel, which is likely to be the most divisive aspect of the S10. One of my favorite aspects of the S10’s design is its swappable eight-way (circular) D-pad, making diagonal attacks in Hollow Knight: Silksong considerably easier to execute than with a four-way D-pad.\n\nIf I could change one thing about the S10, it’d be the system-level buttons (screenshot, GameChat, and home). They’re crammed awkwardly just below the D-pad and right stick.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes, two/ Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable battery, capacity undisclosed / Console wake-up: Yes\n\nIt’s getting easier to find wireless Switch 2 controllers for under $50 that closely match the features found on Nintendo’s pricier models (with some unexpected extras). The Mobapad N1 HD isn’t a new release — it was made for the original Nintendo Switch — yet it works great on Nintendo’s latest console after you update the firmware via Mobapad’s mobile or PC app. It can wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode, too, after you follow along with the one-time setup shown in this YouTube tutorial.\n\nLike the EasySMX S10, the N1 HD features excellent rumble, amiibo support, motion controls, and a comfy, lightweight design. I prefer the S10’s slightly more weighty feel, but I don’t have much to complain about here. In fact, the N1 HD may get the nod in more blind tests since its grips are less coarse and abrasive. The Hall effect sticks and triggers feel great, and the buttons have a quiet yet tactile press. It doesn’t have a dedicated GameChat button, although I’m willing to forgive that omission because no one I know (including me) uses that feature.\n\nThe last thing that I want to shout out is that you can use the mobile app to customize the sound the N1 HD makes when it’s paired and when it turns off. The app has a little piano, and you can customize the sounds coming from each actuator. It’s just nice to hear “Jingle Bells” when I turn on my Switch 2.\n\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 950mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes\n\nGuliKit’s ES Pro is a love letter to the Xbox controller, but for Switch 2. It’s just $29.99, which is a steal considering this gamepad features an eight-way D-pad that’s great for fighting games, Metroidvanias, and retro titles where it’s an advantage to easily be able to aim diagonally (a setting can make it so that it only registers inputs for the cardinal directions, if you prefer).\n\nThe ES Pro doesn’t need to do much to justify its price, but it does so anyway. It features tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks that are resistant to drifting and offer improved power efficiency compared to Hall effect tech, just like the EasySMX S10. Similarly, it can be set up to remotely wake your Switch 2 or OG Switch console from across the room using its own set of strange, one-time-only instructions that you can view in its instruction manual.\n\nI’ve got almost no qualms with this controller, except for its bad rumble. It just has no subtlety, rumbling in an all-or-nothing manner. I was happier using the ES Pro with the vibrations off, which isn’t any fun. Additionally, it’s far less complete than the S10, as it lacks built-in amiibo support and a C button for GameChat; however, depending on your needs, those omissions might not matter to you.\n\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes, two / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes\n\n8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a great yet pricey Switch 2 Pro alternative with a PlayStation-style stick layout. At $69.99, it’s not as affordable (nor as value-packed) as the top contenders. However, the Pro 3 offers a lot of customization, some being cosmetic, while other aspects can impact gameplay.\n\nIt has a lot going for it, with TMR joysticks, two back paddles, and a total of three shoulder buttons per side thanks to new custom M buttons. Its analog stick caps can be popped off in favor of glossy arcade stick-style nubs, which were my preferred choice in fighting games (plus, they just look cool). Its ABXY buttons can be suctioned off with an included tool to swap the layout as needed, and for visual flair, each controller includes colored buttons to evoke a retro Nintendo console. Also, it has trigger locks, letting you set triggers to have a short, clicky pull or the default travel distance.\n\nHowever, I’d skip the Pro 3 if you want good rumble feedback. It’s pretty lousy on that front, to the point that I preferred to turn off rumble entirely in games. In case you’re considering the similarly priced Ultimate 2 Bluetooth, it also has bad rumble, but it’s a great controller otherwise that offers similar features with an Xbox-style stick layout.\n\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No/ Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 800mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes\n\nGuliKit Elves 2 is a compact, Sega Saturn-inspired controller I wanted to love a little more than I do. The affordable gamepad shares some of the same benefits as the identically priced ES Pro — including Switch 2 wake-up and multiplatform support — but it’s smaller, which could make it a great pick for kids or small-handed folks who have a difficult time wrapping their digits around larger gamepads.\n\nThere isn’t much wasted space in this controller, either, as it comes with a rechargeable battery, rumble motors, a gyroscope, and an eight-way D-pad that feels nice to use. Even for my medium-sized hands, its grips turn the small gamepad into something that’s satisfying to hold. I don’t like it as much for a handful of minor reasons relating to long-term comfort, button and trigger feel preferences, and some missing functionality. Compared to the ES Pro, it lacks TMR sticks (it has Hall effect), the Pro’s better triggers, and swappable buttons.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nSince I last updated this post, I’ve received a few controllers that I’m still in the process of testing. GuliKit sent its TT Max and TT Pro wireless controllers, both of which have PlayStation-style stick layouts and TMR joysticks, along with adjustable stick tension, impressive rumble, and other interesting features that should make them contenders for this list. I’m also testing Mobapad’s Chitu2 controller. Its biggest claim is that it replicates the smooth action of Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller, in addition to other worthwhile features, like TMR joysticks. I’m expecting to receive an EasySMX S10 Lite to test soon, as well. It’s a cheaper version of the S10 that lacks amiibo but has what seems like every other feature found in the pricier model.\n\nUpdate, January 9th: Adjusted pricing / availability, and updated the What’s next? section with some new entrants that I’m testing.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T13:00:38-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T18:42:20.583754"}

Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities.\n\nAGCOM issued the fine under Italy’s controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company’s annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent.\n\nThe fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren’t subject to the dispute over piracy.\n\nAGCOM rejected Cloudflare’s arguments.

But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach.\n\nThose new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too.\n\nHow Ozlo’s platform ambitions begin\n\nFounded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES.\n\n“The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said.\n\nThe mental wellness company Calm, for instance, is using the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors can. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed.\n\nOzlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data.\n\nNow, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others.\n\nFor example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different.\n\n“So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?”\n\nPatil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective.\n\n“They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says.\n\nThis relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction.\n\nPatil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks.\n\nOzlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds.\n\nPatil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAn AI to help you sleep better\n\nOzlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest.\n\nThis year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (The company revealed the “buddy” name for its AI agent in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.)\n\nBy integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night.\n\nThe AI features are expected in the second quarter.\n\nNew hardware, EEG insights on the way\n\nOzlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger.\n\n“We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says.\n\nPlus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2.\n\nIn terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen.\n\nThe speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices.\n\nLike the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.)\n\nThe acquisition play\n\nAcquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy.\n\nThe 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention.\n\n“Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained.\n\nA product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well.\n\nWith the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 19:36:04 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T19:53:35.440553"}

While some SEO practices are useful, much of the day-to-day SEO wisdom you see online amounts to superstition. An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called “content chunking” may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google’s Search Off the Record podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea.\n\nYou’ve probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn’t made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by gen AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.\n\nAccording to Google’s Danny Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn’t use such signals to improve ranking. “One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?” said Sullivan. “So… we don’t want you to do that.”\n\nThe conversation, which begins around the podcast’s 18-minute mark, goes on to illustrate the folly of jumping on the latest SEO trend. Sullivan notes that he has consulted engineers at Google before making this proclamation. Apparently, the best way to rank on Google continues to be creating content for humans rather than machines.

He attached a Smart Brick to one end of the ruler, and dragged a second Smart Brick along its length. The Smart Bricks changed color every time another 10 ten studs was passed, exactly at the dividing lines of each segment.\n\nSimons then moved the Smart Bricks away from the ruler and performed the same trick. Using just a pair of Smart Bricks, he was able to measure the distance between two points in 2D and 3D space. Simons says the bricks can accurately track each other’s position at distances of up to roughly 4 to 5 meters (12–16 feet) away.\n\nThen, Simons rotated a brick in midair, and we watched it light up as soon as it was precisely facing the other brick.\n\nFrom previous briefings, I already knew the bricks could tell their own orientation and if they were relatively closer or further from each other. But it’s clearly more powerful than that, with more potential than the first three Lego Star Wars sets will offer on launch day (assuming these precision features work in the real world with all its forms of wireless interference).\n\nThe Lego Star Wars sets very intentionally let kids blast each other’s ships without them truly facing each other, because the company’s research shows kids prefer that. But it clearly doesn’t have to be that way. Low-hanging fruit: future Lego creations could have a precise blasting game.\n\nThey might have potential in Lego robots too. Lego Mindstorms was one of the toymaker’s most sophisticated building sets, but even with drag-and-drop programming capabilities, its complexity limited its appeal to kids. With the Smart Brick’s ability to know its location and orientation around other Smart Bricks, Lego robots could possibly navigate obstacles built with Smart Tags, or autonomously find their way back to base stations without the need for detailed programming, cameras for sensing, or pricier components like the Mindstorms’ Intelligent Brick.\n\nLego’s being extremely quiet about future plans for its new Smart Play system, but it’s getting more and more interesting, with more potential uses, as the company reveals what the bricks are capable of.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T15:50:57-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T20:57:02.351915"}

The fact that it hasn’t happened yet tells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of Elon Musk.\n\nHere’s the relevant Apple App Store developer guideline: “Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.” Huh! How about that.\n\nThey sold their principles for power, and now they don’t even control their own companies\n\nHere’s Google’s version of the same guideline, which is even clearer: “Apps that do not prohibit users from creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children will be subject to immediate removal from Google Play. This includes all child sexual abuse materials.”\n\nBut booting X from these app stores for its flagrant violation of policy means upsetting Musk and the entire right-wing media ecosystem he controls through X — and with it, directly upsetting the clout-chasing content vampires who currently run the United States. Cook’s Apple has a massive dependency on China, and smartphones, computers, and chips are currently exempt from the tariffs on China. Cook can present Donald Trump with as many golden gifts as he wants, but those tariffs don’t have to stay that way.\n\nGoogle’s Pichai is similarly weak. Trump has threatened Google numerous times over his placement in search results, and so far YouTube has managed to mostly avoid scrutiny over its content moderation policies because Pichai has been content to coddle Trump with promises that everything he does is the biggest thing in Google search history. Google also can’t risk upsetting Trump while AI policy remains deeply contested, and having an unhappy Musk influencing that policy is a nightmare of corruption.\n\nThis is the trap these men have gotten themselves into: They sold their principles for power, and now they don’t even control their own companies. Welcome to gangster tech regulation!\n\nApple’s lawyers heavily implied that a naked bananaman called Mr. Peely was somehow inappropriate for court\n\nApple and Google did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nYou know what’s “offensive and sexualized,” you worthless fucking cowards? Nonconsensual AI-generated images of women in bikinis spreading their legs, and of children with so-called “donut glaze” on their faces — which, by the way, were being generated at a rate of one per minute. I’d also call that “offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste” and especially “just plain creepy”! Do you need a back brace to stand up straight, buddy? Because at this point, I am certain you haven’t got a single vertebra.\n\nHey, does anyone else remember when Tumblr got booted from the App Store over pornographic images of children? I guess the real problem was that Tumblr wasn’t owned by Musk, not its violation of App Store policy. Whoopsie!\n\nCan Apple and Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to “shareholder value”?\n\nIt is genuinely unbelievable to me that I wasted hours of my actual life on a court case where Apple explained it needed total control of its App Store to protect its users. Total control of the App Store was Apple’s main argument against antitrust enforcement: The company insisted that its monopolistic control of what users could install on their phones was essential to create a walled garden where it could protect children from unsafe content.\n\nHa! Ha ha ha!!\n\nDoes Google have the same problem with its app store, Google Play? Of course it does, and of course it has made all the same arguments as Apple, although it does allow sideloading apps on Android. But it still hasn’t enforced its rules and pushed X to alternative app stores. Why? Hey Google, show me the photo of Sundar Pichai giggling with Elon Musk at Donald Trump’s inauguration!\n\nThe only consolation here is that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg almost certainly has steam coming out of his ears. Remember when Apple yanked Meta’s App Store enterprise certificate because it was taking too much data? Ah yes, those were the days. At this point, it kinda seems like Alex Roman wasn’t the only Apple witness brazenly lying on the stand.\n\nI never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever again. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human right,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face. I mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has created an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good, the mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan to defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X to generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed?

It’s a massive vote of confidence for both the startup and nuclear power, but challenges remain.", "content": "There are two ways for tech companies to invest in nuclear power right now. One is to buy power from traditional reactors that are already built, either by purchasing electricity from the plants directly or financing the reconstruction of decommissioned units. The other is to invest in one of the dozens of reactor startups promising to commercialize designs and technologies never before used in the American market to generate electricity.\n\nMicrosoft took the former approach with a 2024 deal to buy electricity from a revived Three Mile Island nuclear plant and gambled on Helion, one of the many startups promising to construct America’s first fusion energy station. Amazon chose the other approach, buying a stake in X-energy, the next-generation nuclear company for which the tech behemoth is financing construction of a debut power plant in Washington. Google split the difference with deals to help bring Iowa’s lone decommissioned nuclear plant online again and back construction of the first plant from next-generation startup Kairos Power, the only reactor company in its class to sign a power purchase agreement with a utility so far.\n\nMeta, on the other hand, has taken a cautious approach to nuclear power. The Facebook owner had previously only agreed to buy power from an existing atomic power station in Illinois for its data centers.\n\nNow, Meta is making an unconventional bet on the widely hyped next-gen nuclear startup Oklo.\n\nOn Friday morning, the company announced a deal to pay Oklo cash up front to finance the purchase of fuel for the startup’s reactors.\n\nThe agreement will allow Oklo to advance its plans for a 1.2-gigawatt campus in Pike County, Ohio, a rural municipality east of Cincinnati within the grid system from which Meta’s data centers in the region draw power. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. But Oklo CEO Jake DeWitte tells WIRED in an exclusive interview that it represents “one of the biggest deals around the nuclear space as a whole.”\n\n“This is one of the biggest commitments from a hyperscaler into the nuclear side that we’ve seen,” he said. “It’s a huge validator.”\n\nIt’s part of a broader new nuclear investment from Meta that also includes deals with the Texas-based nuclear utility Vistra and the Bill Gates–owned next-generation nuclear startup TerraPower, which the centrist advocacy group Third Way calls “the largest such investment in nuclear energy in US history.”\n\n“Civilian nuclear power is fundamentally American. We invented it, operate the largest fleet in the world, and are leading in the development of advanced nuclear,” Josh Freed, Third Way’s senior vice president for climate and energy, said in a statement. “Now, we need a lot more private sector investment to keep reactors operating and deploy and commercialize advanced nuclear at scale. The US should lead in nuclear deployment, just as it leads in technology and AI.”\n\nThe price of nuclear fuel is on the rise as a federal ban on certain uranium imports from Russia takes effect and investors speculate about the possibility of a renaissance of reactor construction across the US. For next-generation designers such as Oklo, whose reactors depend on unconventional types of fuel, the problem has been particularly acute. Oklo managed to acquire old government stockpiles of high-assay low-enriched uranium, the material known as HALEU (pronounced HAY-loo) that’s enriched roughly four times as much as traditional reactor fuel. The company is also angling for a chunk of some plutonium leftover from mid-century atomic bomb construction, which Oklo’s reactors can burn as a fuel.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:59:12 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T21:29:03.169597"}

Over the past few days, we saw a slew of announcements from mainstays like Nvidia, Sony, and AMD, along with smaller companies and startups vying for attention through the Unveiled event (CES’s showcase for new products) and across the show floor.\n\nAs has been the case for the past two years, AI was at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the place that agentic AI held last year as the show’s buzzy topic. That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots demonstrated all over the show and showcased in numerous press events.\n\nTo relive the reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time via our live blog right here. Otherwise, let’s dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from CES.\n\nEquity sums up the highs, and lows, of CES 2026\n\nIf audio or video are more your thing, then head right to the latest episode of our Equity podcast, which goes into detail about what we thought about the show, or watch the full episode below on YouTube.\n\nNvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.\n\nThe Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.\n\nAnd Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nAMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships\n\nAMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.\n\nBeyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.\n\nThe standout oddities of CES\n\nLet’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!\n\nHighlights from CES breakout sessions\n\nCES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.\n\nFord’s AI assistant debuts\n\nFord is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.\n\nCaterpillar, Nvidia partner on automated construction equipment\n\nAs part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.\n\nHands-on with Clicks Communicator\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nOne of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.\n\nCheck out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:\n\n“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.\n\n“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”\n\nLG’s home robot CLOiD makes a sluggish first impression\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nA big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? We’ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:\n\n“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOid didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”\n\nEufyMake UV printer is an Etsy maker’s dream\n\nLong used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the eufyMake E1 is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water bottles and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals. Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.\n\nA new way to find and purchase office space\n\nMyCommuters has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other factors to identify an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market. Sean O’Kane has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here.\n\nCheck out the Skylight Calendar 2\n\nImage Credits:Sarah Perez\n\nThis family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources; create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more. Check out our full impressions here.\n\nBoston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots\n\nHyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.\n\nAmazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.\n\nOn the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.\n\nRazer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko\n\nIn the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.\n\nThen there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.\n\nLego Smart Bricks mark the company’s first CES appearance\n\nLego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:36:27 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T22:48:21.271861"}

There are currently 200 people in quarantine and nine in isolation. However, the outbreak is expanding so quickly and with so many exposure sites that health officials are struggling to trace cases and identify people at risk.\n\n“An increasing number of public exposure sites are being identified with likely hundreds more people exposed who are not aware they should be in quarantine if they are not immune to measles,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist and the health department’s incident commander for the measles outbreak, said in the announcement. “Previous measles transmission studies have shown that one measles case can result in up to 20 new infections among unvaccinated contacts.”\n\nThe outbreak is centered in the northwestern corner of the state, with cases concentrated in Spartanburg County. According to state data, in the 2024–2025 school year, only 90 percent of students in the county were fully vaccinated. That’s well below the target of 95 percent vaccination coverage that prevents vaccine-preventable infections from spreading. However, the county-wide vaccination rate likely obscures pockets where vaccination rates are even lower, making the virus more likely to spread.\n\nHighly contagious\n\nMeasles is considered one of the most infectious diseases known to humans. It spreads through the air and can linger in a room’s airspace for up to two hours after an infected person has been present.

He has over 20 years experience in AV, and has previously been on staff at Digital Trends and Reviewed.\n\nOne of the issues holding Auracast back from wider mainstream use is some companies’ lack of support for the Bluetooth technology — Apple being a prime example. With iOS having 58 percent of the market share in North America and nearly 28 percent worldwide, a decision by Apple to enable native Auracast support would potentially put millions of Auracast devices into the world with a firmware update. As of yet, Apple has made no comment on Auracast, and I’m not hopeful that we’ll get one anytime soon.\n\nBut the audio technology company Atitan thinks it has the solution. It’s developing a small disc-shaped transceiver — the splitR — that can attach to an iPhone’s MagSafe and turn it into an Auracast device capable of either transmitting or receiving an Auracast broadcast. The company’s connectR app, which will be available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play this coming summer, will allow you to see broadcasts around you, your connected devices, and create your own Auracast channels or group listening sessions. You’ll be able to interact with all of your streaming platforms to play songs and playlists. Atitan is adding in a social component, too, allowing posts and chats with friends.\n\nThe splitR isn’t meant just for an Apple device, though. While the device will fit a MagSafe connection (although the early version I saw was still a little small for one), you can connect any non-Auracast product to it with a USB-C or 3.5mm cable to give that device Auracast capability. And Atitan tells me the next iteration will be able to pair wirelessly to translate a classic Bluetooth connection into a Bluetooth LE Auracast transmission.\n\nThe splitR can connect to a speaker to play content from your phone or Auracast-capable TV, or your turntable setup to send an Auracast broadcast out to play on headphones or speakers. If you get enough splitR transceivers, you could create an entire whole-home Auracast system. And unlike some Auracast-compatible companies that restrict their devices to work only within their ecosystem, the splitR broadcasts are open to any Auracast headphones or speakers allowed to receive them.\n\nWhat I saw during my demo at CES was encouraging. Beyond sharing music broadcasts with friends, Auracast has the potential to help those in need of hearing assistance, either while out and about at concerts, airports, church, or lectures or just at home watching TV. The more Auracast can get into products — either natively or with adapters like the splitR — the more its accessibility uses become mainstream.\n\nOther Auracast transmitters on the market that I have tried can be clunky to use, but the Atitan team is invested in making a product that’s easy to use and brings all your services and devices together in a single app. The company will be launching a Kickstarter campaign in the next few months for the splitR transceiver and currently has a waitlist for the connectR app.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T17:56:41-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T23:26:38.884499"}

HeyMates and Buddyo are each betting that the collectible figurine boom is going to come back with an AI-powered vengeance, letting us chat to sports stars and superheroes from our desks.\n\nThe core concept to both is this: Take a cutesy figurine and stick it onto a smart base with a speaker, microphone, and maybe a flashing ring of light or two. Then use an accompanying app to power a basic LLM chatbot based on the figurine, so you can talk to Albert Einstein about relativity, or Darth Vader about crushing dissident forces, with some fun wake words and a cheesy joke or two.\n\nOlli showed me two HeyMates, starting with this chibi take on Albert Einstein. And this is Zara. Olli didn’t show me its questionable ‘90s sitcom-inspired Chandler.\n\nBeyond that, the two startups I met this week differ. Olli is the more established of the two. It already provides its AI-driven BuddyOS to a number of other toy companies, but it now wants to build its own devices. With that in mind, it’s launching HeyMates, Funko-esque figurines with RFID chips in their bases, which become interactive AI characters when placed on the accompanying stand.\n\nOlli intends to launch HeyMates on Kickstarter later this year, starting with three figurines: Einstein, who chats about science and creativity; Zara, a tarot reader who gives advice with a hint of mysticism; and Chandler, a bold choice of name for a toy who “brings the dry, sarcastic charm of a ’90s sitcom character,” given the 2023 death of Friends star Matthew Perry.\n\nThe company wants to build its own toys for the sake of creative control, and to get ahead of what CEO Hai Ta predicts is a market about to boom, with imitators and rivals likely on the way. He sees a future involving licensed characters and celebrity likenesses, along with Olli’s own line of HeyMates IP. In short, he wants to build the next Funko Pops, but make it AI.\n\nBuddyo is designed to fit Nintendo’s Amiibo figurines exacty. Its base also includes a small screen that shows emoji and GIFs.\n\nYijia Zhang, CEO of Buddyo, sees things differently. He doesn’t want to replace Funko Pops, but build a platform that might sit alongside them. In fact, it’s not even Funko Pops he really has in mind, but Nintendo’s Amiibo. Zhang describes himself as a Nintendo “superfan,” and Buddyo is his effort to get more out of his own Amiibo collection.\n\nInstead of selling figurines, Buddyo is launching a stand it calls an AI Pod, with a slot the exact size of a standard Amiibo base. The Pod uses the same NFC tech as Nintendo’s figurines to recognize specific characters, and Buddyo will also sell its own NFC-equipped bases onto which you can place Funko Pops, bobbleheads, and (of course) Labubus, with plans for a larger Pod down the line capable of supporting bigger figures.\n\nSince existing figurines don’t come with chatbot personalities baked in, Buddyo has developed an app to create a character for each figurine. Take a photo and give the character a name, and the app’s AI will analyze it, pulling up a backstory and personality. It’s capable of recognizing existing IP, so it knew that Stitch was a cartoon alien, and that Mario is a plumber with a questionable Italian accent who loves to say “It’s-a-me!” And it does deliver that exact accent, letting you pick the voice from a library of different sounds including sound samples matching copyrighted characters. Zhang is quick to emphasize these are all provided by the community, not the company, a loophole he clearly hopes will keep the infamously litigious Nintendo at bay.\n\nZhang’s background is in AI — he was once a software engineer at Google, working on Google Assistant, and currently heads up an AI and platforms team at Plaud. Perhaps that explains his focus on building an AI platform and base, rather than designing new toys from scratch. But he says it’s also about taking advantage of the fact that people already have a “deep connection” with their collections, which would be missing from new toys or new IP.\n\nOnce they’re up and running, HeyMates and Buddyo feel similar. Both emphasize fun, lighthearted chitchat with the AI avatars — “tell me a joke” remains everyone’s favorite demo question — though Zhang says Buddyo’s hybrid ChatGPT / Gemini AI stack can be used as a full AI assistant, just with a little more character. That’s not an option with HeyMates, which are each designed to do one thing well, with plans down the line for specific figurines to chat about movies, or cooking, or K-pop.\n\nIt’s still an open question whether there’s a meaningful market for AI toys and chatbot companions, but combining the tech with collectibles is the most convincing case I’ve seen yet.\n\nNeither HeyMates nor Buddyo has any involvement from Funko, which has its own problems to deal with — just two months ago it warned investors that there was “substantial doubt” over its ability to continue operating, as sales slow and tariffs bite. Will we see a desperate Funko turn to AI for its salvation, or will its inaction provide the opening for a new company to take over the space? Either way, it’s clear chatty collectibles are coming — and soon.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2026-01-09T17:52:36-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-09T23:26:39.077030"}
