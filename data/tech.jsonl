As we like to do on The Vergecast, we take this time of year to see our families, relax and recharge, and go extremely deep into a specific technology that matters right now. This year, we picked the tiny chip in all your devices that is suddenly a precious and expensive commodity: RAM.\n\nOn this episode, David and Nilay are joined by The Verge’s Sean Hollister to get a primer on all things Random Access Memory. The hosts talk through the history of the technology, what RAM made possible in our computers, how it became utterly ubiquitous in practically every electronic device we own, and why it’s so hard to get right now. (Here’s a very 2025 spoiler alert: it’s about AI.) Then, with the help of producer Travis Larchuk, we play some RAM-related games, which go… well, they go.\n\nAfter that, Sean and David chat with Dylan Patel from Semianalysis, who explains why the chip market in general is so overwhelmed right now — and why even in boom times, some companies might be reluctant to invest too heavily in scaling up. He also explains how the AI companies have cornered the market on RAM, whether the data center boom will end anytime soon, and what it all means for the prices of our devices.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who has listened to, watched, and talked with us about The Vergecast this year. Have a happy, restful, memory-filled holiday, and we’ll see you in 2026! Maybe even at our CES live show in Las Vegas!\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T09:35:49-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:38.419329"}

Instead of running my routine, it told me it couldn’t do that. Ever since I upgraded to Alexa Plus, Amazon’s generative-AI-powered voice assistant, it has failed to reliably run my coffee routine, coming up with a different excuse almost every time I ask.\n\nIt’s 2025, and AI still can’t reliably control my smart home. I’m beginning to wonder if it ever will.\n\nThe potential for generative AI and large language models to take the complexity out of the smart home, making it easier to set up, use, and manage connected devices, is compelling. So is the promise of a “new intelligence layer” that could unlock a proactive, ambient home.\n\nBut this year has shown me that we are a long way from any of that. Instead, our reliable but limited voice assistants have been replaced with “smarter” versions that, while better conversationalists, can’t consistently do basic tasks like operating appliances and turning on the lights. I want to know why.\n\nI’m still waiting on the promise of voice assistants that can seamlessly control my smart home. Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nThis wasn’t the future we were promised.\n\nIt was back in 2023, during an interview with Dave Limp, that I first became intrigued by the possibilities of generative AI and large language models for improving the smart home experience. Limp, then the head of Amazon’s Devices & Services division that oversees Alexa, was describing the capabilities of the new Alexa they were soon to launch (spoiler alert: it wasn’t soon).\n\nAlong with a more conversational assistant that could actually understand what you said no matter how you said it, what stood out to me was the promise that this new Alexa could use its knowledge of the devices in your smart home, combined with the hundreds of APIs they plugged into it, to give the assistant the context it needed to make your smart home easier to use.\n\nFrom setting up devices to controlling them, unlocking all their features, and managing how they can interact with other devices, a smarter smart home assistant seemed to hold the potential to not only make it easier for enthusiasts to manage their gadgets but also make it easier for everyone to enjoy the benefits of the smart home.\n\nFast-forward three years, and the most useful smart home AI upgrade we have is AI-powered descriptions for security camera notifications. It’s handy, but it’s hardly the sea change I had hoped for.\n\nIt’s not that these new smart home assistants are a complete failure. There’s a lot I like about Alexa Plus; I even named it as my smart home software pick of the year. It is more conversational, understands natural language, and can answer many more random questions than the old Alexa.\n\nWhile it sometimes struggles with basic commands, it can understand complex ones; saying “I want it dimmer in here and warmer” will adjust the lights and crank up the thermostat. It’s better at managing my calendar, helping me cook, and other home-focused features. Setting up routines with voice is a huge improvement over wrestling with the Alexa app — even if running them isn’t as reliable.\n\nGoogle’s new Gemini for Home AI-powered smart home assistant won’t fully launch until next spring, when its new smart speaker arrives. Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nThe problem is that the new assistants aren’t as consistent at controlling smart home devices as the old ones. While they were often frustrating to use, the old Alexa and Google Assistant (and the current Siri) would generally always turn on the lights when you asked them to, provided you used precise nomenclature.\n\nToday, their “upgraded” counterparts struggle with consistency in basic functions like turning on the lights, setting timers, reporting on the weather, playing music, and running the routines and automations on which many of us have built our smart homes.\n\nWhy is this, and will it ever get better? To understand the problem, I spoke with two professors in the field of human-centric artificial intelligence with experience with agentic AI and smart home systems. My takeaway from those conversations is that, while it’s possible to make these new voice assistants do almost exactly what the old ones did, it will take a lot of work, and that’s possibly work most companies just aren’t interested in doing.\n\nBasically, we’re all beta testers for the AI.\n\nConsidering there are limited resources in this field and ample opportunity to do something much more exciting (and more profitable) than reliably turn on the lights, that’s the way they’re moving, according to experts I spoke with. Given all these factors, it seems the easiest way to improve the technology is to just deploy it in the real world and let it improve over time. Which is likely why Alexa Plus and Gemini for Home are in “early access” phases. Basically, we’re all beta testers for the AI.\n\nThe bad news is it could be a while until it gets better. In his research, Dhruv Jain, assistant professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Michigan and director of the Soundability Lab, has also found that newer models of smart home assistants are less reliable. “It’s more conversational, people like it, people like to talk to it, but it’s not as good as the previous one,” he says. “I think [tech companies’] model has always been to release it fairly fast, collect data, and improve on it. So, over a few years, we might get a better model, but at the cost of those few years of people wrestling with it.”\n\nThe Alexa that launched in 2014 on the original Echo smart speaker isn’t capable enough for the future Amazon is working toward. Image: Amazon\n\nThe inherent problem appears to be that the old and new technologies don’t mesh. So, to build their new voice assistants, Amazon, Google, and Apple have had to throw out the old and build something entirely new. However, they quickly discovered that these new LLMs were not designed for the predictability and repetitiveness that their predecessors excelled at. “It was not as trivial an upgrade as everyone originally thought,” says Mark Riedl, a professor at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. “LLMs understand a lot more and are open to more arbitrary ways to communicate, which then opens them to interpretation and interpretation mistakes.”\n\nBasically, LLMs just aren’t designed to do what prior command-and-control-style voice assistants did. “Those voice assistants are what we call ‘template matchers,’” explains Riedl. “They look for a keyword, when they see it, they know that there are one to three additional words to expect.” For example, you say “Play radio,” and they know to expect a station call code next.\n\n“It was not as trivial an upgrade as everyone originally thought.” — Mark Riedl\n\nLLMs, on the other hand, “bring in a lot of stochasticity — randomness,” explains Riedl. Asking ChatGPT the same prompt multiple times may produce multiple responses. This is part of their value, but it’s also why when you ask your LLM-powered voice assistant to do the same thing you asked it yesterday, it might not respond the same way. “This randomness can lead to misunderstanding basic commands because sometimes they try to overthink things too much,” he says.\n\nTo fix this, companies like Amazon and Google have developed ways to integrate LLMs with the APIs at the heart of our smart homes (and most of everything we do on the web). But this has potentially created a new problem.\n\n“The LLMs now have to compose a function call to an API, and it has to work a whole lot harder to correctly create the syntax to get the call exactly right,” Riedl posits. Where the old systems just waited for the keyword, LLM-powered assistants now have to lay out an entire code sequence that the API can recognize. “It has to keep all that in memory, and it’s another place where it can make mistakes.”\n\nAll of this is a scientific way of explaining why my coffee machine sometimes won’t make me a cup of coffee, or why you might run into trouble getting Alexa or Google’s assistant to do something it used to do just fine.\n\nSo, why did these companies abandon a technology that worked for something that doesn’t? Because of its potential. A voice assistant that, rather than being limited to responding to specific inputs, can understand natural language and take action based on that understanding is infinitely more capable.\n\n“What all the companies that make Alexa and Siri and things like that really want to do is chaining of services,” explains Riedl. “That’s where you want a general language understanding, something that can understand complex relationships through tasks and how they’re conveyed by speech. They can invent the if-else statements that chain everything together, on the fly, and dynamically generate the sequence.” They can become agentic.\n\n“The question is whether … the expanded range of possibilities the new technology offers is worth more than a 100 percent accurate non-probabilistic model.” — Dhruv Jain\n\nThis is why you throw away the old technology, says Riedl, because it had no chance of doing this. “It’s about the cost-benefit ratio,” says Jain. “[The new technology] is not ever going to be as accurate at this as the non-probabilistic technology before, but the question is whether that sufficiently high accuracy, plus the expanded range of possibilities the new technology offers, is worth more than a 100 percent accurate non-probabilistic model.”\n\nOne solution is to use multiple models to power these assistants. Google’s Gemini for Home consists of two separate systems: Gemini and Gemini Live. Anish Kattukaran, head of product at Google Home and Nest, says the aim is to eventually have the more powerful Gemini Live run everything, but today, the more tightly constrained Gemini for Home is in charge. Amazon similarly uses multiple models to balance its various capabilities. But it’s an imperfect solution that has led to inconsistency and confusion in our smart homes.\n\nRiedl says that no one has really figured out how to train LLMs to understand when to be very precise and when to embrace randomness, meaning even the “tame” LLMs can still get things wrong. “If you wanted to have a machine that just was never random at all, you could tamp it all down,” says Riedl. But that same chatbot would not be more conversational or able to tell your kid fantastical bedtime stories — both capabilities that Alexa and Google are touting. “If you want it all in one, you’re really making some tradeoffs.”\n\nThese struggles in its deployment in the smart home could be a harbinger of broader issues for the technology. If AI can’t turn on the lights reliably, why should anyone rely on it to do more complex tasks, asks Riedl. “You have to walk before you can run.”\n\nBut tech companies are known for their propensity to move fast and break things. “The story of language models has always been about taming the LLMs,” says Riedl. “Over time, they become more tame, more reliable, more trustworthy. But we keep pushing into the fringe of those spaces where they’re not.”\n\nRiedl does believe in the path to a purely agentic assistant. “I don’t know if we ever get to AGI, but I think over time we do see these things at least being more reliable.” The question for those of us dealing with these unreliable AIs in our homes today, however, is are we willing to wait and at what cost to the smart home in the meantime?", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T08:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:38.628100"}

The year before, Congress had overwhelmingly passed a bill banning TikTok unless it broke ties with its Chinese parent company. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld it, and it was clear what needed to happen next: either the president could give TikTok another 90 days to complete a deal or it would be banned immediately.\n\nBut neither of those things happened. Outgoing President Joe Biden punted the decision to incoming President Donald Trump, and after a dramatic few hours where TikTok took itself offline in the US, it returned with a triumphant message thanking Trump for saving it.\n\nNearly a year and four extra-legal extensions later, TikTok remains in the States, owned by the same Chinese company lawmakers warned would gravely endanger US national security. It only recently announced it had finalized a deal to sell its US-based business, with a targeted closing date of January 22nd, 2026 — more than a year after it was first supposed to be banned. The whole ordeal felt like a comedy of errors, where ultimately everyone threw up their hands. The few details known about a supposedly coming deal raise questions about whether it will even comply with the law’s original requirements.\n\nThe failure to take any action at all against TikTok following the panic around its alleged national security risks is just one of many cracks to the federal government’s foundation this year. In March, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth communicated war plans over Signal — an encrypted messaging platform but not one meant for such a use case due to potential security risks on users’ devices — which we only found out about because Trump’s then-national security adviser apparently accidentally added the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic to that chat.\n\nAnd then there was the biggest full-on rupture to the government in 2025: Elon Musk’s pet project, DOGE\n\nThere have been many other instances where democracy’s counterweights have shown signs of life, and at times, even bravery\n\nOf course, the only true test of a democracy’s durability is to see how its checks fare when things break. The TikTok saga shows one example where — at least so far — they have weathered poorly. Congress has issued tepid statements about the executive branch’s unwillingness to enforce the law, but there’s no appetite to impeach Trump over it, and the judicial branch can’t or won’t force action, either. But there have been many other instances where democracy’s counterweights have shown signs of life, and at times, even bravery.\n\nAs 2026 approaches, political posturing for the midterms is likely to overshadow any real efforts at policymaking. With that will come a slew of messages from politicians promising to fix what was broken this year and also promising to break what hasn’t worked in far too long.

The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) says that Apple abused its dominant app store market position by burdening developers with “disproportionate” terms around data collection that exceed privacy law requirements, compared to rules for native iOS apps.\n\nThe fine specifically targets the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy Apple launched in 2021, which requires third-party developers to ask users for consent twice to track their data across other apps and websites.

He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAs a reluctant doomsday prepper and eager vanlifer, Dometic’s battery-powered Go Faucet has, for the last few years, played a central role in my bougie bug-out kit and my camping rig’s water system. So it took me all of two minutes with Dometic’s new Recon 360 Faucet to realize it’s an upgrade in every single way that matters — and then confirmed after a week of testing it.\n\nThe Recon 360 Faucet lets you pump water out of a storage container like a typical faucet in places that lack traditional plumbing, be it inside a boat, cabin, or van, or at the beach, job site, or campground. A long silicone water hose attaches to the back of the faucet and snaps into the CPC quick-connect fitting found on Dometic’s Go Jug or Recon Hardside Coolers. But there’s nothing to stop you from dropping that tube into any jerry can via a third-party CPC adapter. It also works with inline filters like the one I use from LifeStraw and Camelbak.\n\nAs to the upgrades, the Recon 360 Faucet ditches the easy-to-miss touch surface for real mechanical buttons. One button produces a standard water flow to brush your teeth or fill a glass, and the second, larger button emits a more forceful stream for washing dishes, your hair, or quickly filling a water bottle before heading out on a hike. The water stream shuts off with a second press of the active button, otherwise it’ll automatically stop the flow after 90 seconds or 1.5L/3L to avoid depleting that precious resource.\n\nIt’s very small and portable with a battery good for about 150 liters. Here in my van, the rotating base prevents the stiff water tube from twisting the faucet away from the sink. Stacked on top of Dometic’s 11-liter Go Jug, where the water tube connects through that white CPC coupler on top. The light is very useful at night. Pictured here in a blacked-out room.\n\nIn my testing, pressing the smaller button extracts one liter of water in 41 seconds (at a loud 52dB from arm’s length), while the fast button yields one liter in just 24 seconds at an even louder 60dB. The low-flow mode is quieter than the original one-button Go Faucet, with a less annoying drone due to its lower pitch. However, it’s still too loud for vanlifers to sneak a glass of water at night while others sleep, although the bright LED light that illuminates the stream certainly makes it possible.\n\nAnd as the name suggests, the base can now be rotated 360 degrees for more placement options. It’s a welcome change that should reduce the number of times I have to clean water off my kitchen counter when the stiff, crimp-resistant water hose — included with both Dometic models — caused the lightweight Go Faucet to twist away from the sink.\n\nThankfully, the new tap has also been migrated from Micro USB to a USB-C connector for charging, with a battery that’s still good for about 150 liters (about 40 gallons). The Recon 360 Faucet now also has a 4-stage LED meter on top that shows the remaining charge.\n\nThe faucet is slightly smaller but a little heavier than the Go model. It comes with a selection of metal pucks that can be adhered to a countertop or water jug to create a platform for the faucet’s magnetic base. The force of the new magnet feels about twice as strong as the older model, which should hold the faucet in place better when driving down bumpy roads. That’s good because I’ve sent my Go Faucet flying through the van about five or six times now, yet it just keeps on pumping. I hope the Recon 360 Faucet is just as durable.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 9 The water hose clicks into the Dometic Go Jug (shown here), Dometic’s new Recon Hardside Coolers, and even generic jerry cans that use universal CPC couplers.\n\nThe only real issue is the price: $149.99 for the Recon 360 Faucet, instead of $99.99 for the Go Faucet, which Dometic still sells. The Go Faucet is great, but the Recon 360 fixes so many little complaints that I think it’s worth every extra penny. Yes, there are cheaper and less-functional alternatives to be had on Amazon and AliExpress, but if you need to use a portable faucet regularly, like I do, then Dometic’s durable and feature-rich faucets won’t disappoint if you can afford them.\n\nAll photography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T05:44:07-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:39.123442"}

Here’s how to sift through the acronyms, storage options, and extra features to find the best one for you.", "content": "Buying a laptop is an exercise in confusion. Even if you know what everything means and exactly what you want, finding it can be difficult. Heck, just navigating the manufacturer's website to locate the model you want is frustrating. We hope this guide will help you traverse the morass of modern laptops. Below is a section on every major component you'll want to know about when you browse for the best laptop for you. We break down the jargon and explain things on a practical level, so you end up with a machine that's the right fit.\n\nUpdated December 2025: We've added the latest chip news from Intel, AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm. We also have details about the incoming memory shortage and the future of ChromeOS.\n\nUnderstanding Use Cases and Budget\n\nBefore getting into the nitty-gritty, I always recommend starting with the biggest question first: What will you do with your new laptop? Is this a business machine meant primarily for office work and other simple tasks that can be done in a browser? Or perhaps you have a burgeoning interest in a hobby like PC gaming, video editing, coding, or design. Maybe one of those hobbies is more of a job for you, meaning you'll want something that is designed from the ground up to accelerate work in those applications. On the other side of the spectrum, maybe you plan to primarily use your laptop on the go, whether that's on a plane or in coffee shops. In that case, portability and battery life may be the most important factors to consider.\n\nThe answer to those questions will help point you in the right direction and ensure that you don't overspend on features or performance you don't need. For example, buying a MacBook Pro instead of a MacBook Air just because you have extra money to spend isn't a good idea. That brings us to the budget: $1,000 is an important price. There are many good options below that price, but it's the level at which you can expect laptops to feel premium and lack any significant compromises. It's the starting retail price of the starting MacBook Air, as well as several Windows laptops. Thanks to solid discounts, it's not uncommon to see these laptops dip in price to $700.\n\nSpeaking of Windows laptops, you'll have to be patient to find something under $600 that's still worth buying. If your budget is $500 or less, you're better off buying a Chromebook. They'll feel faster and lighter, and usually get longer battery life too, at least compared to similarly priced Windows laptops.\n\nWhich Operating System Is Best?\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nI won't waste your time repeating the same arguments you've probably already heard about why macOS is better than Windows, or vice versa. Both have strengths and weaknesses, and you likely already have opinions about them. The truth is that these operating systems are more similar today than they have ever been, not unlike Android and iOS. So if you're on the fence, I recommend opting for a laptop that runs whichever is most familiar.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:39.497323"}

It is, however, a totally usable system with minimal bloatware, and any qualms I have with some odd choices don’t harm the gaming performance.\n\nAt its listed price of almost $2,000, this configuration of the iBuyPower is charging you a modest premium just to install (almost) all of the components, but frequent sales and discounts make this a more palatable deal as the price gets lower.\n\nIt’s really only set back by some minor assembly issues, as well as parts that may limit future upgrades, which currently affects users at opposite ends of the PC building spectrum disproportionately. Given the current RAM pricing issues, this is a better value than ever, and perhaps cheaper than an off-the-shelf build.\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nA Mixed Experience\n\nFirst, the good stuff: The GPU is packaged separately from the rest of the system, which may sound odd, but I've found that’s one of the most common pain points when shipping a new gaming PC. I’ve seen system builders use expanding foam, special brackets, and folded cardboard supports, among other solutions, but packing the graphics cards in its original box is far simpler and safer, and the other ways of shipping a PC with an installed graphics card still require opening the system up anyway. I do wish the instructions were more specific to the case, particularly since the PCIe bracket might be a little fiddly for total novices, but anyone who has worked with gaming systems in the past shouldn't have any issues.\n\nThe case isn't particularly unique or eye-catching, but it does have a wide, slightly smoky glass side panel that helps give it a clean silhouette. The dark tint allows the lights underneath to shine a bit without the whole system being overtly gamer-coded, but also makes them extremely reflective. There are no screws holding it in place, it’s just press fit, but it’s nice and sturdy, and I didn’t worry about it falling out.

Most of these fake images appear to be generated without the consent of the women in the photos. Some of these same users are also offering advice to others on how to use the generative AI tools to strip the clothes off of women in photos and make them appear to be wearing bikinis.\n\nUnder a now-deleted Reddit post titled “gemini nsfw image generation is so easy,” users traded tips for how to get Gemini, Google’s generative AI model, to make pictures of women in revealing clothes. Many of the images in the thread were entirely AI, but one request stood out.\n\nA user posted a photo of a woman wearing an Indian sari, asking for someone to “remove” her clothes and “put a bikini” on instead. Someone else replied with a deepfake image to fulfil the request. After WIRED notified Reddit about these posts and asked the company for comment, Reddit’s safety team removed the request and the AI deepfake.\n\n“Reddit's sitewide rules prohibit nonconsensual intimate media, including the behavior in question,” said a spokesperson. The subreddit where this discussion occurred, r/ChatGPTJailbreak, had over 200,000 followers before Reddit banned it under the platform’s “don't break the site” rule.\n\nAs generative AI tools that make it easy to create realistic but false images continue to proliferate, users of the tools have continued to harass women with nonconsensual deepfake imagery. Millions have visited harmful “nudify” websites, designed for users to upload real photos of people and request for them to be undressed using generative AI.\n\nWith xAI’s Grok as a notable exception, most mainstream chatbots don’t usually allow the generation of NSFW images in AI outputs. These bots, including Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, are also fitted with guardrails that attempt to block harmful generations.\n\nIn November, Google released Nano Banana Pro, a new imaging model that excels at tweaking existing photos and generating hyperrealistic images of people. OpenAI responded last week with its own updated imaging model, ChatGPT Images.\n\nAs these tools improve, likenesses may become more realistic when users are able to subvert guardrails.\n\nIn a separate Reddit thread about generating NSFW images, a user asked for recommendations on how to avoid guardrails when adjusting someone’s outfit to make the subject’s skirt appear tighter.

In 2025, all it takes to get away with tens of billions of dollars in black-market crypto deals is a messaging platform willing to host scammers and human traffickers, enough persistence to relaunch channels and accounts on that service when they’re occasionally banned, and fluency in Chinese.\n\nThe ecosystem of marketplaces for Chinese-speaking crypto scammers hosted on the messaging service Telegram have now grown to be bigger than ever before, according to a new analysis from the crypto tracing firm Elliptic. Despite a brief drop after Telegram banned two of the biggest such markets in early 2025, the two current top markets, known as Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee, are together enabling close to $2 billion a month in money-laundering transactions, sales of scam tools like stolen data, fake investment websites, and AI deepfake tools, as well as other black market services as varied as pregnancy surrogacy and teen prostitution.\n\nexpired: crypto markets for US drug dealers tired: crypto markets for Russian hackers wired: crypto markets for Chinese scammers Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nThe crypto romance and investment scams regrettably known as “pig butchering”—carried out largely from compounds in Southeast Asia staffed with thousands of human trafficking victims—have grown to become the world’s most lucrative form of cybercrime.

By selling money-laundering services and other scam-related offerings to those operations, markets like Tudou Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee have grown in parallel to an immense scale.\n\n“When you consider illicit use of crypto assets, there really isn’t anything larger right now,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s cofounder and chief scientist.\n\nIn fact, these criminal trading zones aren’t simply the biggest online black markets of the moment, but the biggest in history. AlphaBay was once the biggest dark-web market for drugs, stolen data, and hacking tools. Described by the FBI as 10 times the size of the original Silk Road dark-web drug market at its peak, AlphaBay facilitated more than $1 billion in transactions over its two and a half years online. Hydra, a Russian dark-web market that also offered money-laundering services to cryptocurrency thieves and ransomware groups, did more than $5 billion in transactions over its seven years of operation.\n\nBy comparison, Huione Guarantee, the Chinese-language, Telegram-based market used largely by crypto scammers, facilitated a stunning $27 billion in transactions from 2021 to 2025, according to Elliptic, dwarfing every online black market before it, even as it operated in full public view on Telegram’s messaging platform.

Many of its original members are in full-time roles at various government agencies, and the new National Design Studio (NDS) is headed by Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, a close ally of Musk’s.\n\nEven if DOGE doesn’t survive another year, or until the US semiquincentennial—its original expiration date, per the executive order establishing it—the organization’s larger project will continue. DOGE from its inception was used for two things, both of which have continued apace: the destruction of the administrative state and the wholesale consolidation of data in service of concentrating power in the executive branch. It is a pattern that experts say could spill over beyond the Trump administration.\n\n“I do think it has altered the norms about where legislative power ends and where executive power begins simply by ignoring those norms,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. “This is not necessarily going to be limited to Republican administrations. There are going to be future Democratic presidents who will say, ‘Well, DOGE was able to do this, why can't we?’”\n\nThe earliest days of DOGE were characterized by a chaotic blitz in which small teams of DOGE operatives, like the now infamous Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, were deployed across government agencies, demanding high-level access to sensitive data, firing workers, and cutting contracts. And while these moves were often radical, if not appearing to be illegal, as matters of bureaucratic operation, they were in service of what had been the Trump administration’s agenda all along.\n\nexpired: big balls tired: big balls wired: big balls Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.\n\nGoals like cutting discretionary spending and drastically reducing the size of the federal workforce had already been championed by people like vice president JD Vance, who in 2021 called for the “de-Ba’athification” of the government, and Russell Vought, now the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These goals were also part of Project 2025. What DOGE brought wasn’t the end, but the means—its unique insight was that controlling technical infrastructure, something achievable with a small group, functionally amounted to controlling the government.\n\n“There has never been a unit of government that was handed so much power to fundamentally upend government agencies with so little oversight,” says Moynihan.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the authority for establishing and funding federal agencies comes from Congress. But Trump and many of the people who support him, including Vought and Vance, adhere to what was until relatively recently a fringe view of how government should be run: the unitary executive theory. This posits that, much like the CEO of a company, the president has near complete control over the executive branch, of which federal agencies are a part—power more like that of a king than of the figure described in the nation’s founding documents.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:40.480201"}

But the firm is beefing up its cybersecurity with an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\"", "content": "Even as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulates AI agents to follow malicious instructions often hidden in web pages or emails, is a risk that’s not going away anytime soon — raising questions about how safely AI agents can operate on the open web.\n\n“Prompt injection, much like scams and social engineering on the web, is unlikely to ever be fully ‘solved,’” OpenAI wrote in a Monday blog post detailing how the firm is beefing up Atlas’ armor to combat the unceasing attacks. The company conceded that “agent mode” in ChatGPT Atlas “expands the security threat surface.”\n\nOpenAI launched its ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers rushed to publish their demos, showing it was possible to write a few words in Google Docs that were capable of changing the underlying browser’s behavior. That same day, Brave published a blog post explaining that indirect prompt injection is a systematic challenge for AI-powered browsers, including Perplexity’s Comet.\n\nOpenAI isn’t alone in recognizing that prompt-based injections aren’t going away. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. The U.K. government agency advised cyber professionals to reduce the risk and impact of prompt injections, rather than think the attacks can be “stopped.”\n\nFor OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.”\n\nThe company’s answer to this Sisyphean task? A proactive, rapid-response cycle that the firm says is showing early promise in helping discover novel attack strategies internally before they are exploited “in the wild.”\n\nThat’s not entirely different from what rivals like Anthropic and Google have been saying: that to fight against the persistent risk of prompt-based attacks, defenses must be layered and continuously stress-tested. Google’s recent work, for example, focuses on architectural and policy-level controls for agentic systems.\n\nBut where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent.\n\nThe bot can test the attack in simulation before using it for real, and the simulator shows how the target AI would think and what actions it would take if it saw the attack. The bot can then study that response, tweak the attack, and try again and again. That insight into the target AI’s internal reasoning is something outsiders don’t have access to, so, in theory, OpenAI’s bot should be able to find flaws faster than a real-world attacker would.\n\nIt’s a common tactic in AI safety testing: build an agent to find the edge cases and test against them rapidly in simulation.\n\n“Our [reinforcement learning]-trained attacker can steer an agent into executing sophisticated, long-horizon harmful workflows that unfold over tens (or even hundreds) of steps,” wrote OpenAI. “We also observed novel attack strategies that did not appear in our human red teaming campaign or external reports.”\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nIn a demo (pictured in part above), OpenAI showed how its automated attacker slipped a malicious email into a user’s inbox. When the AI agent later scanned the inbox, it followed the hidden instructions in the email and sent a resignation message instead of drafting an out-of-office reply. But following the security update, “agent mode” was able to successfully detect the prompt injection attempt and flag it to the user, according to the company.\n\nThe company says that while prompt injection is hard to secure against in a foolproof way, it’s leaning on large-scale testing and faster patch cycles to harden its systems before they show up in real-world attacks.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to share whether the update to Atlas’ security has resulted in a measurable reduction in successful injections, but says the firm has been working with third parties to harden Atlas against prompt injection since before launch.\n\nRami McCarthy, principal security researcher at cybersecurity firm Wiz, says that reinforcement learning is one way to continuously adapt to attacker behavior, but it’s only part of the picture.\n\n“A useful way to reason about risk in AI systems is autonomy multiplied by access,” McCarthy told TechCrunch.\n\n“Agentic browsers tend to sit in a challenging part of that space: moderate autonomy combined with very high access,” said McCarthy. “Many current recommendations reflect that trade-off. Limiting logged-in access primarily reduces exposure, while requiring review of confirmation requests constrains autonomy.”\n\nThose are two of OpenAI’s recommendations for users to reduce their own risk, and a spokesperson said Atlas is also trained to get user confirmation before sending messages or making payments. OpenAI also suggests that users give agents specific instructions, rather than providing them access to your inbox and telling them to “take whatever action is needed.”\n\n“Wide latitude makes it easier for hidden or malicious content to influence the agent, even when safeguards are in place,” per OpenAI.\n\nWhile OpenAI says protecting Atlas users against prompt injections is a top priority, McCarthy invites some skepticism as to the return on investment for risk-prone browsers.\n\n“For most everyday use cases, agentic browsers don’t yet deliver enough value to justify their current risk profile,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. “The risk is high given their access to sensitive data like email and payment information, even though that access is also what makes them powerful. That balance will evolve, but today the trade-offs are still very real.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:11:19 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:40.757908"}

Researchers have been studying the phenomenon for well over a decade, and they’ve developed a range of strategies to mitigate any problems.\n\nWind turbines present a unique challenge to radar operators.\n\n“The motion of a wind turbine gives it a complex Doppler signature,” Nicholas O’Donoughue, a senior engineer at the Rand Corporation, told TechCrunch.\n\nDoppler refers to the change in frequency of a wave like a radar signal caused by a moving object. As a wind turbine’s blades sweep through their arc, they are alternately moving toward and away from the radar station. The angle and speed of the blades can have an effect, too.\n\nThose, along with other considerations, can “challenge the detection of any targets that are near the wind farm,” O’Donoughue said.\n\nBut radar systems can filter out signals that result from wind farms. “The primary approach is to use adaptive processing algorithms, such as Space-Time Adaptive Processing, to learn the structure of a wind farm’s interference,” he said.\n\n“Over time, the reflections from a wind farm can be processed to look for patterns, which can then be matched and suppressed. This process is analogous to how modern adaptive noise cancellation headphones work, albeit more complicated.” Objects with a low radar cross section can still slip through, he noted.\n\nBecause of that, many wind farms are already built with radar installations in mind. “The most basic and widely employed mitigation method is wind farm siting, such as modifying the layout of a proposed wind farm to keep the wind turbines out of the line-of-sight of the radar,” the 2024 Energy department report said.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:52:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:40.991369"}

It’s the latest move by Ellison’s son, David Ellison — the CEO of Paramount Skydance — to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” a Paramount press release published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount’s offer, but the elder Ellison’s “personal guarantee” is new, the press release states.\n\nThe revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount’s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was announced on December 5, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion.\n\nThree days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion, offering $30 per share. The WBD board rejected this offer, calling it “illusory” and claiming that Paramount had misled shareholders about the proposed deal’s financing. At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was “a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.”\n\nNow, Paramount’s amended offer has been designed to “address WBD’s stated concerns regarding Paramount’s superior offer,” Paramount said.

Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.\n\nAt its core, the Splay is a projector, meaning it can’t compete with high-end LCD-LED or OLED monitors. It costs $1,300; the device is currently sold out, but an Arovia representative told me that it will be restocked this month.\n\nHere’s how the device works, per one of Arovia’s patents\n\nThe … collapsible, portable display device, has a housing member having a sliding member aligned on the exterior of the housing member, and sliding along the exterior of said housing member between two operating positions, a collapsible screen containing one or more sheets of flexible, wrinkle resistant silicone or rubber materials containing optical enhancing components and capable of displaying an image when in an expanded operating position, and multiple collapsible members connected to said screen …\n\nArovia’s representative pointed to the Splay being used for mobile workspaces, gaming, and enterprise use cases, like trade shows.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:30:06 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:41.578541"}

His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA’s market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the successful debut of ULA’s Vulcan rocket, followed by struggles to ramp up the new rocket’s launch cadence.\n\nBruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin’s ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA’s leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.\n\nIn his first year, Bruno announced what would become the Vulcan rocket and the phaseout of ULA’s legacy Atlas and Delta launch vehicles. He also selected Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, then an emerging space company, to build the Vulcan rocket’s booster engines, bypassing the industry’s established propulsion contractor.\n\nThe decision to develop a new rocket and the selection of the engine to power it proved to be correct. The Atlas V rocket, now nearing retirement, is powered by Russian engines, a nonstarter in today’s geopolitical reality, and the already-retired Delta IV launch vehicle was prohibitively expensive. The Vulcan rocket has been successful in all three of its flights so far, and the performance of Blue Origin’s liquid-fueled BE-4 engine has, by all accounts, been exceptional.\n\nHard times at the rocket ranch\n\nBut ULA’s potential for regaining its position atop the launch market was hamstrung by the company’s decision to make the Vulcan rocket fully expendable. There are long-term plans to recover and reuse the rocket’s main engines, but not the entire booster. And the new rocket’s entry into service has not been smooth. The Vulcan rocket flew just once this year after receiving certification from the US Space Force to carry national security satellites into orbit, well short of Bruno’s goal of flying the new launcher up to 10 times.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 23:51:44 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:42.061462"}

A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA’s workforce.\n\nOn its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing’s Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.\n\nThe Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore lost his ability to control the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.\n\n“There was concern in real time that without recovery of some control, neither a docking nor a deorbit could be controllable, and that could have led to loss of vehicle and crew,” said Charlie Precourt, a former space shuttle commander and now a member of NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP). “Given the severity of this anomaly, NASA wisely and correctly used the safe haven of the ISS to conduct testing and engineering on the ground to analyze the various recovery options.”\n\nConfusion and uncertainty\n\nThroughout that summer, managers from NASA and Boeing repeatedly stated that the spacecraft was safe to bring Wilmore and Williams home if the station needed to be evacuated in an emergency.

Desperate samurai dispossessed by the restoration of the emperor enter into a deadly game for a life-changing cash prize — all for the entertainment of anonymous elites. Unlike its inspirations Battle Royale and Squid Game, however, Last Samurai Standing’s violence is chaotic, fast-paced, and kinetic, though it hides a careful choreography that makes the series a more electric proposition than its predecessors.\n\nViewers have Junichi Okada to thank for that. As well as starring in and producing Last Samurai Standing, he serves as the series’ action planner. Many will be familiar with the results of an action planner’s work — sometimes called an action director, elsewhere a “coordinator,” and even “choreographer” — though perhaps not what the role entails. In the case of Last Samurai Standing, it’s a role that touches on nearly every aspect of the production, from the story to the action itself.\n\n“I was involved from the script stage, thinking about what kind of action we wanted and how we would present it in the context of this story,” Okada tells The Verge. “If the director [Michihito Fujii] said, ‘I want to shoot this kind of battle scene,’ I would then think through the content and concept, design the scene, and ultimately translate that into script pages.”\n\nThe close relationship between the writer and director extends to other departments, too. Though an action planner’s role starts with managing fight scenes and stunt performers, they also liaise with camera, wardrobe, makeup, and even editorial departments to ensure fight scenes cohere with the rest of the production.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt’s a role which might appear a natural progression for Okada, who is certified to teach Kali and Jeet Kune Do — a martial art conceived by Bruce Lee — and holds multiple black belts in jiujitsu. Though the roots of his progression into action planning can be traced back further, to 1995 when he became the youngest member of J-pop group V6.\n\n“Dance experience connects directly to creating action,” he says. “[In both] rhythm and control of the body are extremely important.” Joining V6 at the age of 15, that experience has made Okada conscious of how he moves in relation to a camera during choreography, how he is seen within the structure of a shot, and, critical to action planning, how to navigate all of that safely from a young age.\n\nThat J-pop stardom also offered avenues into acting, initially in roles you might expect for a young pop star: comic heartthrobs and sitcom sons. But he was steadily able to broaden his output. A starring turn in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Hana followed, as did voice acting in Studio Ghibli’s Tales From Earthsea and From Up on Poppy Hill. A more telling departure was a starring role in 2007’s SP, in which he played a rookie in a police bodyguard unit, for which he trained for several years under shootfighting instructor Yorinaga Nakamura.\n\n“What I care about is whether audiences feel that ‘this man really lives here as a samurai.’”\n\nIn the years since, Okada has cemented himself as one of Japan’s most recognizable actors, hopping between action starring roles in The Fable to sweeping period epics like Sekigahara. Those two genres converge in his Last Samurai Standing role of Shujiro, a former Shogunate samurai now reduced to poverty, working through his PTSD and reckoning with his bloodthirsty past in the game. These days, it’s less of a concern that the character butts up against his past idol image, he suggests. “What I care about is whether audiences feel that ‘this man really lives here as a samurai.’”\n\nFor Okada’s work on Last Samurai Standing, as both producer and action planner, that involved lacing high-octane but believable action with the respect for history and character studies of the period dramas he loves. “Rather than being 100 percent faithful to historical accuracy,” he adds, “my goal was to focus on entertainment and story, while letting the ‘DNA’ and beauty of Japanese period drama gently float up in the background.”\n\nA focus on what he defines as “‘dō’ — movement,” pure entertainment that “never lets the audience get bored” punctuated — with “‘ma,’” the active emptiness that connects those frenetic moments. Both can be conversations, even if one uses words and another communicates dialogue through sword blows. This is most apparent when Shujiro faces his former comrade Sakura (Yasushi Fuchikami) inside a claustrophobic bank vault that serves as a charnel house for the game’s less fortunate contestants.\n\n“The whole battle is divided into three sequences,” Okada says. The first starts with a moment of almost perfect stillness, a deep breath, before the two launch into battle. “A fight where pride and mutual respect collide,” he says, “and where the speed of the techniques reaches a level that really surprises the audience.” It’s all captured in one, zooming take with fast, tightly choreographed action reminiscent of Donnie Yen and Wu Jing in Kill Zone.\n\nSo intense is their duel that both shatter multiple swords. The next phase sees them lash out in a more desperate and brutal manner with whatever weapons they find. Finally, having fought to a weary stalemate, the fight becomes, Okada concludes, “a kind of duel where their stubbornness and will are fully exposed” as they hack at each other with shattered blades and spear fragments.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt’s a rhythm that many fights in Last Samurai Standing follow, driven by a string of physical and emotional considerations that form the basis of an action planner’s tool kit: how and why someone fights based on who they are and their environment. Here it is two former samurai in an elegant and terrifyingly fast-paced duel. Elsewhere we see skill matched against brutality, or inexperience against expertise.\n\n“I define a clear concept for each sequence,” Okada says, before he opens those concepts up to the broader team. From there, he might add notes, but in Last Samurai Standing, action is a collaborative affair. “We keep refining,” he says. “It’s a back-and-forth process of shaping the sequence using both the ideas the team brings and the choreography I create myself.”\n\nThere is a third factor which Okada believes is the series’ most defining. “If we get to continue the story,” he says, “I’d love to explore how much more we can lean into ‘sei’ — stillness, and bring in even more of a classical period drama feel.”\n\nAs much of a triumph of action as Last Samurai Standing is, its quietest moments are the ones that stay with you. The charged looks between Shujiro and Iroha (Kaya Kiyohara) or their shuddering fright when confronted with specters of their past. Most of all, Shujiro watching his young ward, Futaba Katsuki (Yumia Fujisaki), dance before a waterlogged torii as mist hovers. These pauses are what elevate and invigorate the breathless action above spectacle.\n\nThe pauses are also emblematic of the balance that Last Samurai Standing strikes between its period setting and pushing the boundaries of action, all to inject new excitement into the genre. “Japan is a country that values tradition and everything it has built up over time. That’s why moments where you try to update things are always difficult,” Okada says. “But right now, we’re in the middle of that transformation.”\n\nThat is an evolution that Okada hopes to support through his work, both in front of and behind the camera. If he can create avenues for new generations of talent to carry Japanese media to a broader audience and his team to achieve greater success on a global stage, “that would make me very happy,” he says. “I want to keep doing whatever I can to help make that possible.”\n\nThe first season of Last Samurai Standing is streaming on Netflix now, and a second season was just confirmed.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T10:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T15:30:50.027059"}

It’s not clear how long the surveillance system has been public, but artifacts from the system show that its database was set up in September 2024, and traffic monitoring began in mid-2025.\n\nThe exposure offers a rare glimpse into how such national license plate surveillance systems work, the data they collect, and how they can be used to track the whereabouts of any one of the millions of people across an entire country.\n\nThe lapse also reveals the security and privacy risks associated with the mass monitoring of vehicles and their owners, at a time when the United States is building up its nationwide array of license plate readers, many of which are provided by surveillance giant Flock. Earlier this week, independent news outlet 404 Media reported that Flock left dozens of its own license plate reading cameras publicly exposed to the web, allowing a reporter to watch themselves being tracked in real time by a Flock camera.\n\nSen said he found the exposed Uzbek license plate surveillance system earlier this month, and shared details of the security lapse with TechCrunch. Sen told TechCrunch that the system’s database reveals the real-world locations of the cameras, and contains millions of photos and raw camera video footage of passing vehicles.\n\nThe system is run by the Department of Public Security in Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tashkent, which did not respond to emails requesting comment about the security lapse during December.\n\nRepresentatives of the Uzbek government in Washington D.C. and New York also did not respond to TechCrunch’s emails about the exposure. Uzbekistan’s computer emergency readiness team, UZCERT, did not respond to an alert about the system, except for an automated reply acknowledging receipt of our email.\n\nThe surveillance system remains exposed to the web at the time of writing.\n\nThe system refers to itself as an “intelligence traffic management system” by Maxvision, a Shenzhen, China-based maker of internet-connected traffic technologies, border inspection systems, and surveillance products. In a video on LinkedIn, the company says its cameras can record the “entire illegal process,” and can “display illegal and passing information in real-time.”\n\nAccording to its brochure, Maxvision exports its security and surveillance tech to countries across the globe, including Burkina Faso, Kuwait, Oman, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nTechCrunch’s analysis of the data inside the exposed system revealed at least a hundred cameras located across major Uzbek cities, as well as busy junctions and other important transit routes.\n\nWe plotted the GPS coordinates of the cameras, and found banks of license plate readers in Tashkent, the cities of Jizzakh and Qarshi in the south, and Namangan in the east. Some of the cameras are located in rural areas, such as on routes near the once-disputed parts of the borders between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot) Image Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nIn Tashkent, the country’s largest city, the cameras can be found at more than a dozen locations. Some of these cameras are even visible on Google Street View.\n\nThe cameras, some which watermark their footage with the name of the Singapore camera maker Holowits, capture video footage and still images of vehicles violating rules in 4K resolution.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nThe exposed system allows access to its web-based interface, which contains a dashboard allowing operators to examine footage of traffic violations. The dashboard contains zoomed-in photos and the raw video footage of violations, as well as surrounding vehicles. (TechCrunch redacted the license plates and vehicle occupants prior to publication.)\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nThe exposure of Uzbekistan’s national license plate reading system is the latest example of a security lapse involving road surveillance cameras.\n\nEarlier this year, Wired reported that more than 150 license plate readers around the United States and the real-time vehicle data they collect were exposed to the internet without any security.\n\nExposed license plate readers are not a new phenomena. In 2019, TechCrunch reported that over a hundred license plate readers were searchable and accessible from the internet, allowing anyone to access the data within.

Under the 2014–2025 rules, this was set at 18:1, but for 2026 onward, it has been reduced to 16:1.\n\nThis is measured at ambient temperature, though, not while the engine is running. A running engine is hotter—much hotter—than one sitting at ambient, and as metals heat up, they expand. The engines have very short throws, so it doesn’t take much expansion to increase the compression ratio by reducing the distance between the piston and cylinder head at the top of its travel. The benefit could be as much as 15 hp (11 kW), which translates to a few tenths of a second per lap advantage.\n\nUnfortunately for the other teams, the FIA stated that its rules indeed specify only that the compression ratio should be 16:1 based on static conditions and at ambient temperatures. “This procedure has remained unchanged despite the reduction in the permitted ratio for the 2026 season. It is true that thermal expansion can influence dimensions, but the current rules do not provide for measurements to be carried out at elevated temperatures,” the FIA said.\n\nSo if Mercedes and Red Bull do have a horsepower advantage, it’s one that will likely be baked into the 2026 season.\n\nThe compression ratio clarification wasn’t the only one issued by the FIA. For some time now, F1 has used ultrasonic fuel flow meters as a way to control power outputs. Under the outgoing regulations, this was capped at 100 kg/h, but with the move to fully sustainable synthetic fuels, this is changing to an energy cap of 3,000 MJ/h instead.\n\nIn the past, it had been theorized that teams could try to game the fuel flow meters—the most impressive idea I heard involved pulsing more fuel between the sensor’s sampling inputs to boost power, although I don’t believe it was ever implemented.\n\nDon’t even think about being that clever this time, the FIA says. “Any device, system, or procedure, the purpose of which is to change the temperature of the fuel-flow meter, is forbidden,” it says, updating the regulation that previously banned “intentional heating or chilling” of the fuel flow meter.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://arstechnica.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:25:38 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T15:30:50.936505"}

Lowpass is taking a winter break and will be back on January 8, 2026.\n\nAll I want for Christmas is to find that darn movie I’ve been meaning to watch. What was it called again? I could have sworn I bookmarked it somewhere…\n\nIf your household is anything like mine, you might frequently run into the same issue: There’s too much to watch out there, and keeping track of all the things you want to stream one day has become a nightmare. It’s not that there aren’t any tools for this. There are! And plenty of them! And they’re all easy to use! Which is kind of the problem.\n\nHere’s what usually happens: I may be browsing Netflix, logged into my profile, and bookmark a movie I want to check out in the future. Then, my wife takes over the remote, spends a bit of time clicking through Hulu, and adds a show she wants us to binge to the watch list associated with her profile. Or so we think — until we try to find it again and eventually discover that she was actually logged into our daughter’s profile and inadvertently added the show to her watch list.\n\nThen, the next day, we turn on the TV and see something fun on the homescreen. One quick button press, and it’s added to the watch list. Except, Google maintains this one, and it’s completely separate from all the other lists. Our family probably has about a dozen different watch lists. We don’t use them all actively, at least not when we’re in the mood to actually find something. But you can bet that there’s some really fun movie on our dog’s Tubi watch list (that my kids made), desperately waiting for us to finally remember where we bookmarked it.\n\nThere are apps that are trying to solve this very issue. Plex, for instance, has a pretty decent universal catalog of titles available across all the major streaming services and a watch list to remember your favorites. The app also does a good job deep-linking into third-party services, so you can jump directly to that Netflix show or movie rental on Amazon with one click. At least that’s true on mobile. On smart TVs, those deep links can be hit or miss, depending on the platform your TV is running. (Sorry, Roku users! You’re out of luck.)\n\nThe problem is that a universal watch list like this does require a lot more work on your part. When you browse Netflix at 11PM and stumble across something that looks interesting, you have to get your phone out, open the Plex app, search for that same title, and add it to the list. And when you finally get around to watch it, you’ll have to do the same thing all over again to remove the title from Plex’s list. That’s a lot of work for a little late-night TV.\n\nThe sad truth is that watch lists, as well-intended as they were, are broken. Here’s how streaming services and smart TV platforms could fix them: Instead of keeping all watch-list data in a silo, these services should enable consumers to opt into sharing it between services. That way, if I bookmark a movie on Netflix, the Netflix app shares that information with my Plex watch list. Once I watch it, it disappears from both lists again. And when my wife adds a Hulu show to our Google TV watch list, it immediately populates in our Hulu watch list as well.\n\nIdeally, I’d want to have a bunch of different ways to enter this kind of data and just as many ways to consume it. Maybe I’d keep one master list maintained by Plex, Google, or another company. But I’d also want to be able to keep smashing that bookmark button in whatever streaming app I’m in and have all my lists across all providers update in real time. Granted, Netflix may never list titles that are only available on Hulu. But these days, shows regularly move from one service to another. What if Netflix internally made a note of shows I bookmarked on HBO Max and then added them to my Netflix watch list when those HBO shows eventually found their way to its service?\n\nOnce you have enough data flowing back and forth between streaming apps and watch lists, you may also be less dependent on profiles, which were always an imperfect solution. Sure, my wife and I may like different things on occasion. But most of the time, we watch TV together. So why not automatically sort our bookmarked shows and movies by genre, mood, and age rating, instead of siloing them in watch lists associated with individual profiles?\n\nFederating watch lists, and liberating movie and TV show bookmarks from those silos, could also allow for a whole range of neat new use cases that simply aren’t possible today. What if, for instance, Spotify automatically generated playlists of the soundtracks of movies and shows you recently watched, based on the data of titles disappearing from your watch list? (Hat tip to J Herskowitz for this one.)\n\nUnfortunately, streaming services are incredibly protective of their data. Companies like Netflix want you to spend all your time within their app and not with a third-party aggregator that might recommend titles from Hulu’s catalog based on your Netflix viewing history. In fact, Netflix is so protective of its in-app experience, and its own watch list, that it doesn’t allow Google TV users to add Netflix titles to their smart TV’s universal watch list. And none of the major streaming services, with Plex being the one notable exception, offers an RSS feed of your watch list.\n\nBut this time of the year, I can’t help but hope for miracles. Perhaps, there’s a streaming executive out there right now, still looking for a New Year’s resolution. Here’s a great one: Open the floodgates. Free the data. Let people remix it, build interesting hacks. Ingest as much data as possible from other services, and use it to help everyone find the perfect movie or show without having to scour a thousand lists.\n\nUntil that happens, I might just crack open a book. Now, if I could only remember what I wanted to read next…", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T11:30:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:13.192349"}

The landmark bill is called [&#8230;]", "content": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nA group of tech companies and academic institutions spent tens of thousands of dollars in the past month — likely between $17,000 and $25,000 — on an ad campaign against New York’s landmark AI safety bill, which may have reached more than two million people, according to Meta’s Ad Library.\n\nThe landmark bill is called the RAISE Act, or the Responsible AI Safety and Education Act, and days ago, a version of it was signed by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. The closely watched law dictates that AI companies developing large models — OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, DeepSeek, etc. — must outline safety plans and transparency rules for reporting large-scale safety incidents to the attorney general. But the version Hochul signed — different than the one passed in both the New York State Senate and the Assembly in June — was a rewrite that made it much more favorable to tech companies. A group of more than 150 parents had sent the governor a letter urging her to sign the bill without changes. And the group of tech companies and academic institutions, called the AI Alliance, were part of the charge to defang it.\n\nThe AI Alliance — the organization behind the opposition ad campaign — counts Meta, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Snowflake, Uber, AMD, Databricks, and Hugging Face among its members, which is not necessarily surprising. The group sent a letter in June to New York lawmakers about its “deep concern” about the bill and deemed it “unworkable.” But the group isn’t just made up of tech companies. Its members include a number of colleges and universities all around the world, including New York University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Notre Dame, as well as Penn Engineering and Yale Engineering.\n\nThe ads began on November 23 and ran with the title, “The RAISE Act will stifle job growth.” They said that the legislation “would slow down the New York technology ecosystem powering 400,000 high-tech jobs and major investments. Rather than stifling innovation, let’s champion a future where AI development is open, trustworthy, and strengthens the Empire State.”\n\nWhen The Verge asked the academic institutions listed above whether they were aware they had been inadvertently part of an ad campaign against widely discussed AI safety legislation, none responded to a request for comment, besides Northeastern, which did not provide a comment by publication time. In recent years, OpenAI and its competitors have increasingly been courting academic institutions to be part of research consortiums or offering technology directly to students for free.\n\nMany of the academic institutions that are part of the AI Alliance aren’t directly involved in one-on-one partnerships with AI companies, but some are. For instance, Northeastern’s partnership with Anthropic this year translated to Claude access for 50,000 students, faculty, and staff across 13 global campuses, per Anthropic’s announcement in April. In 2023, OpenAI funded a journalism ethics initiative at NYU. Dartmouth announced a partnership with Anthropic earlier this month, a Carnegie Mellon University professor currently serves on OpenAI’s board, and Anthropic has funded programs at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nThe initial version of the RAISE Act stated that developers must not release a frontier model “if doing so would create an unreasonable risk of critical harm,” which the bill defines as the death or serious injury of 100 people or more, or $1 billion or more in damages to rights in money or property stemming from the creation of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon. That definition also extends to an AI model that “acts with no meaningful human intervention” and “would, if committed by a human,” fall under certain crimes. The version Hochul signed removed this clause. Hochul also increased the deadline for disclosure for safety incidents and lessened fines, among other changes.\n\nThe AI Alliance has lobbied previously against AI safety policies, including the RAISE Act, California’s SB 1047, and President Biden’s AI executive order. It states that its mission is to “bring together builders and experts from various fields to collaboratively and transparently address the challenges of generative AI and democratize its benefits,” especially via “member-driven working groups.” Some of the group’s projects beyond lobbying have involved cataloguing and managing “trustworthy” datasets and creating a ranked list of AI safety priorities.\n\nThe AI Alliance wasn’t the only organization opposing the RAISE Act with ad dollars. As The Verge wrote recently, Leading the Future, a pro-AI super PAC backed by Perplexity AI, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale, and OpenAI president Greg Brockman, has spent money on ads targeting the cosponsor of the RAISE Act, New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores. But Leading the Future is a super PAC with a clear agenda, whereas the AI Alliance is a nonprofit that’s partnered with a trade association — with the mission of “developing AI collaboratively, transparently, and with a focus on safety, ethics, and the greater good.”", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T11:18:49-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:13.386538"}

Its clever design adds layers of extra functionality, and the inclusion of a retractable two-way charging cable expands the number of devices you can charge without always having to remember to pack a cord. It also improves your smartphone’s ergonomics when taking photos, but that’s one of a few places where the PowerGrip’s functionality feels disappointingly limited.\n\nThe PowerGrip is much chunkier and heavier than I expected, which turned out not to be a bad thing. At 272 grams, most of the PowerGrip’s weight comes from its 9,300mAh battery, but I wouldn’t opt for anything smaller because I like knowing I’ve got enough power to fully recharge my iPhone with headroom to top off other devices like my watch and earbuds.\n\nThere are lighter wireless power banks available with more capacity, but the PowerGrip’s heft has some benefits. Most consumers will buy the accessory to make their smartphone feel more like a digital camera, and the PowerGrip mostly delivers. It attaches to the back of any Qi2, MagSafe, or Pixelsnap-compatible smartphone. The magnetic connection feels secure but doesn’t feel quite as strong as the PopSocket I regularly use. I’m not worried my iPhone is going to fall off on its own, but accidentally bumping my phone while I’m only holding the PowerGrip could send my device tumbling.\n\nThe protruding grip is sizable and makes your phone feel like a sturdy DSLR. I’ve never found a comfortable one-handed way to shoot with my iPhone that also feels secure, but it’s easy with the PowerGrip, and its weight adds some welcome stability that usually requires two hands.\n\nThe PowerGrip can stand on its edge and be used as a hands-free smartphone stand. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nThe design allows the PowerGrip to stand on its edge and function as a smartphone stand. You can attach your phone and make hands-free recordings or video calls, or take advantage of iOS’ StandBy mode on your bedside table. It’s functionality I never intended to use, but have found myself using quite frequently.\n\nThe PowerGrip’s shutter button is a little thin for my liking. I prefer round buttons and having them positioned on top of a camera grip. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nThe PowerGrip has a dedicated shutter button that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth. Pressing it once snaps a photo, while holding it down triggers a video recording until released. I would prefer the button positioned at the top of the grip instead of its front edge. I also frequently found myself missing the additional settings dials on my Sony mirrorless camera that are conveniently located within thumb’s reach.\n\nThere are no other camera controls on the PowerGrip, and when using it one-handed you may struggle to reach useful functions on your phone with your thumb. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nThere are other smartphone camera grips, like the Fjorden Pro and the magnetic Leica Lux Grip, that feature more controls, including customizable dials and two-stage shutter buttons for controlling focus. They’re both considerably more expensive than the $80 PowerGrip, and those added controls only work with third-party camera apps, so I understand Belkin’s decision not to take that approach. But with the PowerGrip attached and hanging a half-inch off the bottom of my iPhone 16 Pro, my thumb struggled to reach the onscreen controls in the iOS camera app without awkwardly adjusting my grip. More often than not, one-handed shooting still required screen taps from my other hand, which I found frustrating.\n\nBuilt-in retractable charging cables are becoming more common with power banks, and the PowerGrip’s can be used to charge itself or other devices. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nEven more frustrating is the PowerGrip’s power output. Wireless charging rates are limited to just 7.5W, which feels glacial when Belkin has already implemented faster 25W Qi2.2 rates on other chargers. It takes hours to fully charge my iPhone, and it’s not much faster switching to a cable. The PowerGrip has an additional USB-C port and a built-in 30-inch USB-C charging cable. Belkin says the power output maxes out at 15W, but I measured a little over 18W while charging a OnePlus 12 with Plugable’s USB-C voltage meter. However, that output is shared when charging three devices simultaneously. Charging rates for the OnePlus 12 dropped to less than 5W while also wirelessly charging my iPhone and a Kobo e-reader using the retractable cable.\n\nA small but very bright screen on the front of the PowerGrip shows its remaining charge level and when it’s being used to charge other devices. Photo by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge\n\nCompared to more expensive camera grip accessories like the $395 Leica Lux Grip or the $149.95 ShiftCam ProGrip that only feature batteries to power themselves, it’s understandable that Belkin had to settle for some compromises to get its Stage PowerGrip on shelves for $79.99. You’ll just want to really take those compromises into consideration when deciding if it’s worth it for you. If you like a lot of functionality in one accessory, it’s worth considering. If you want more charging performance or a grip with more photography-focused functionality, you’ll be better off juggling multiple accessories.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "published": "2025-12-23T11:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:13.803758"}

Digital avatar generation company Lemon Slice is working to add a video layer to those chats with a new diffusion model that can create digital avatars from a single image.\n\nCalled Lemon Slice-2, the model can create a digital avatar that works on top of a knowledge base to play any role required of the AI agent, like addressing customer queries, helping with homework questions, or even working as a mental health support agent.\n\n“In the early days of GenAI, my co-founders started to play around with different video models, and it became obvious to us that video was going to be interactive. The compelling part about tools like ChatGPT was that they were interactive, and we want video to have that layer,” co-founder Lina Colucci said.\n\nLemon Slice says this is a 20-billion-parameter model that can work on a single GPU to live-stream videos at 20 frames per second. The company is making the model available through an API and an embeddable widget that companies can integrate into their sites with a single line of code. After an avatar is created, you can change the background, styling, and appearance of a character at any point.\n\nBesides human-like avatars, the company is also focusing on being able to generate non-human characters to suit different needs. The startup is using ElevenLabs’ tech to generate the voices of these avatars.\n\nFounded by Lina Colucci, Sidney Primas, and Andrew Weitz in 2024, Lemon Slice is betting that using its own general-purpose diffusion model (a type of generative model that learns to work backwards from noisy training data to generate new data) for making avatars will set it apart from competitors.\n\n“The existing avatar solutions I’ve seen to date add negative value to the product,” Colucci said. “They are creepy, and they are stiff. They look good for a few seconds, and as soon as you start interacting with them, it feels very uncanny, and it doesn’t put you at ease. The thing that has prevented avatars from really taking off is that they haven’t been good enough.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nTo fund that effort, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $10.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Dropbox CTO Arash Ferdowsi, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, and The Chainsmokers.\n\nThe company says it has guardrails in place to prevent unauthorized face or voice cloning, and that it uses large language models for content moderation.\n\nLemon Slice would not name the organizations using its technology, but said the model is being put to work for use cases like education, language learning, e-commerce, and corporate training.\n\nThe startup faces stiff competition from video generation startups like D-ID, HeyGen, and Sythesia, as well as other digital avatar makers Genies, Soul Machine, Praktika, and AvatarOS.\n\nIlya Sukhar, a partner at Matrix, thinks that avatars will be useful in areas where videos are prominent. For instance, people like learning from YouTube rather than reading long blocks of text. He noted that Lemon Slice’s technical prowess and its own will give it an edge over other startups.\n\n“It’s a deeply technical team with a track record of shipping ML products, not just demos and research. Many of the other players are bespoke to particular scenarios or verticals, and Lemon Slice is taking the generalized ‘bitter lesson’ scaling approach (of data and compute) that has worked in other AI modalities,” he said.\n\nY-Combinator’s Jared Friedman believes that using a diffusion-style model allows Lemon Slice to generate any kind of avatars as compared to some other startups that are focused on either human-like or game character-like avatars.\n\n“Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test. They train the same type of model as Veo3 or Sora: a video diffusion transformer. Because it is a general-purpose model that does the whole thing end-to-end, it has no ceiling on how good it can get; the others top out below photorealistic. It also works for both human and non-human faces and requires only an image to add a new face,” he said.\n\nThe startup currently has eight employees, and plans to use the funds to hire engineering and go-to-market staff, along with paying the compute bills to train its models.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:15.088958"}

His dad built homes for major developers, and his mom sold to big-box builders across the East Coast.\n\nDonahue was particularly interested in why designing a custom home cost a fortune and took forever, and why most people had to settle for whatever the developers were offering that year. So when he dropped out of NC State and moved to the Bay Area, he eventually did what you might expect a college drop-out to do in San Francisco: he started a company to fix it.\n\nThat effort, Atmos, went through Y Combinator, raised $20 million from investors like Khosla Ventures and Sam Altman, and tried to use tech to streamline the custom home design process. It had designers on staff who worked with clients while software handled the back-end. It grew to 40 people and $7 million in revenue, and they designed $200 million worth of houses, and built 50.\n\nAll that sounds great until you hear Donahue describe it. “It became this extremely operational business,” he told me on a Zoom call last week. “Kind of like a glamorized architecture firm.”\n\nIt never quite replaced the humans, in other words. Then the Federal Reserve started jacking up interest rates, and suddenly clients who’d spent months designing their dream homes couldn’t afford them anymore. Nine months ago, Donahue shut it down.\n\nHere’s where most founders would take a break, maybe write a few LinkedIn posts about what they learned. Instead, Donahue regrouped and started another company.\n\nDrafted is now nearly five months old, and it’s everything Atmos wasn’t. No designers on staff. No operational complexity. Just AI-driven software that generates residential floor plans and exterior designs in minutes. You tell it what you want – bedrooms, square footage, whatever – and it spits out five designs. Don’t like them? You can generate five more and keep going until something clicks.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nRight now, Drafted has six employees, four from Atmos, and it’s raised $1.65 million at a $35 million post-money valuation from Bill Clerico, Stripe’s Patrick Collison, Jack Altman, Josh Buckley, and Warriors player Moses Moody.\n\nClerico led the round because he’d also been an angel investor in Atmos, and had watched Donahue will houses into existence despite rising interest rates. When Donahue told him about the new company over coffee, Clerico didn’t need convincing. “Nick, please take our money,” he apparently said repeatedly over a two week period until Donahue agreed.\n\nThe pitch is straightforward. Right now, if you want a custom home, you’ve got two options: hire an architect (expensive, slow), or buy a template plan online (cheap, inflexible). Drafted sits in the middle, offering customization at template prices. A complete plan costs between $1,000 and $2,000.\n\nThe economics work because Drafted built its own AI model, trained on real house plans from homes that were built and passed permitting. Practical constraints are considered, and Donahue says the specialized model costs almost nothing to run: two-tenths of a penny per floor plan, compared to 13 cents for general-purpose AI.\n\nDrafted only does single-story homes right now, but multi-story and lot-specific features are coming. The bigger question is whether there’s actually a market for this.\n\nThe numbers aren’t huge. Of the million new homes built in America each year, only 300,000 are custom designed. Most people buy existing homes or pick from whatever tract homes the big builders are offering.\n\nClerico’s argument is that this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Make custom design cheap and fast enough, and many more people will do it. Donahue compares it to Uber, which didn’t just replace taxis but made on-demand car service something that nearly everyone uses. “There’s really no reason in the future why everyone shouldn’t have a totally custom designed home,” Clerico says.\n\nOr maybe most Americans will keep being price-conscious buyers who take what’s available. The housing market has a long track record of rebuffing disruption.\n\nThere’s also the “moat” question. Asked what’s to keep an LLM player or even another vertical player from buying similar data sets and creating the same product, Donahue talks about brand, pointing to his friend David Holz, who founded the video and image generating AI outfit, Midjourney. Despite the plethora of new image-generation models being launched, Midjourney’s usage barely moves, Holz has told Donahue; its customers keep coming back to make AI images.\n\nSimilarly, Donahue thinks if they move fast enough and please enough customers, Drafted can become the place for people to design houses.\n\nTime will tell. Since opening to the public, the outfit has begun seeing about 1,000 daily users. Not huge numbers, but they show steady growth for such a young product.\n\nIn the meantime, Donahue has something pretty valuable that could give Drafted an edge: deep knowledge of a problem and the insights gleaned from taking a crack at it once already.\n\nPictured above, the Drafted crew, left to right: Martynas Pocius, Albert Chiu, Martina Cheru, Carson Poole, Stephen Chou, and Nick Donahue", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:32:01.750296"}

The Rutgers MSA was one of dozens of organizations infiltrated by the NYPD, according to an Associated Press investigation in 2011 that relied on leaked documents outlining the infiltration operations. Following rounds of negative publicity and a civil rights suit that was settled in 2018, the NYPD “demographics unit” was disbanded. Hashmi did not sign on to the settlement and lost his original open-records case in 2018, when a 4-3 Court of Appeals decision affirmed the NYPD’s ability to use a “Glomar” response to his request for documents about the mosque-raking program, neither confirming nor denying the existence of such records.\n\nHashmi filed a new set of record requests under the New York Freedom of Information Law in February asking for a narrower set of records than his previous request—weekly intelligence summaries, profiles of specific organizations targeted by the Intelligence Division, and reports on particular mosques—pertaining to community and religious organizations he participated in from 2006 through 2008. His petition, filed in December after the NYPD rejected his FOIL and subsequent appeal, cites specific intelligence reports from that period published 14 years ago by the Associated Press.\n\nIn an interview, Hashmi told WIRED he was motivated by the loss of his father as well as his co-plaintiff in his original suit, Harlem Imam Talib Abdur-Rashid (who passed away in November 2025), to take a second crack at uncovering the truth about the NYPD’s spying operations targeting Arab and Muslim organizations and communities in New York City, the surrounding states, and elsewhere in the United States.\n\nA firm supporter of Mamdani, Hashmi said he restarted his research into the Intelligence Division’s activities in New York and the surrounding areas in 2023, prompted by the NYPD’s violent crackdown on a series of protests in the past three years that are now the subject of a pair of lawsuits alleging rampant First and Fourteenth Amendment violations. However, it was Mamdani’s decision to retain Jessica Tisch as police commissioner shortly after his election victory that pushed Hashmi into action.", "language": "en", "category": "tech", "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/rss", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T17:53:52.651063"}
