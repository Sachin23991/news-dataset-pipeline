By analyzing nearly 35,000 elite achievers across science, music, chess, and sports, researchers found that early stars rarely become adult superstars. Most world-class performers developed slowly and explored multiple fields before specializing. The message is clear: talent grows through variety, not narrow focus.", "content": "Exceptional performers play a major role in driving innovation and tackling some of the world's most urgent challenges. Because of this, societies have a strong stake in understanding how top-level talent develops. A new review published in the journal Science argues that many long standing approaches to gifted education and talent development rest on flawed assumptions. For the first time, an international and interdisciplinary research team has brought together evidence on how world-class performers emerge in science, classical music, chess, and sports.\n\nFor decades, research on giftedness and expertise has followed a familiar model. Outstanding achievement was thought to depend on strong early performance, such as excelling in school subjects, sports, or concerts, combined with specific abilities like intelligence, physical coordination, or musical talent. These traits were believed to need years of intense, discipline-focused training to produce elite results. As a result, many talent programs concentrate on identifying the top young performers early and pushing them to specialize quickly.\n\nAccording to new findings led by Arne Güllich, professor of sports science at RPTU University Kaiserslautern-Landau, this approach may not be the most effective way to nurture future high achievers.\n\nWhy Earlier Research Missed the Full Picture\n\nUntil recently, most studies of giftedness focused on young or sub-elite performers. These groups included school and college students, youth athletes, young chess players, and musicians training at conservatories. However, evidence drawn from adult world-class athletes has begun to challenge conclusions based on these earlier samples.\n\n\"Traditional research into giftedness and expertise did not sufficiently consider the question of how world-class performers at peak performance age developed in their early years,\" Arne Güllich explains. The goal of the new Review was to address this gap by examining how elite performers actually progressed over time.\n\nTo do this, Güllich worked with an international research team that included Michael Barth, assistant professor of sports economics at the University of Innsbruck, D. Zach Hambrick, professor of psychology at Michigan State University, and Brooke N. Macnamara, professor of psychology at Purdue University. Their findings are now published in Science.\n\nPooling Evidence Across Fields\n\nThe researchers reexamined large datasets from many previous studies, analyzing the developmental histories of 34,839 top-level performers from around the world. The group included Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, Olympic medalists, elite chess players, and leading classical music composers. This effort made it possible, for the first time, to compare how world-class performers develop across very different disciplines.\n\nEarly Stars Are Rarely Future Legends\n\nOne of the most striking conclusions is that elite performers follow a developmental path that differs from long-held assumptions. \"And a common pattern emerges across the different disciplines,\" Güllich notes.\n\nFirst, individuals who stand out as the best at a young age are usually not the same people who become the best later in life. Second, those who eventually reached the highest levels tended to improve gradually during their early years and were not top performers within their age group. Third, future world-class achievers typically did not focus on a single discipline early on. Instead, they explored a range of activities, such as different academic subjects, musical genres, sports, or professions (e.g., different subjects of study, genres of music, sports, or professions).\n\nHow Variety Builds Stronger Performers\n\nThe researchers propose three ideas that may help explain these patterns. \"We propose three explanatory hypotheses for discussion,\" says Güllich.\n\nThe search-and-match hypothesis suggests that exposure to multiple disciplines increases the likelihood of eventually finding the best personal fit. The enhanced-learning-capital hypothesis proposes that learning in diverse areas strengthens overall learning capacity, making it easier to continue improving later at the highest level within a chosen field. The limited-risks hypothesis argues that engaging in multiple disciplines reduces the chance of setbacks such as burnout, unhealthy work-rest imbalances, loss of motivation, or physical injury in psychomotor disciplines (sports, music).\n\nArne Güllich summarizes the combined effect of these factors: \"Those who find an optimal discipline for themselves, develop enhanced potential for long-term learning, and have reduced risks of career-hampering factors, have improved chances of developing world-class performance.\"\n\nEncouraging Breadth Instead of Early Specialization\n\nBased on these findings, Güllich offers clear guidance on how young talent should be supported. The evidence suggests avoiding early specialization in a single field. Instead, young people should be encouraged and given opportunities to explore several areas of interest and receive support in two or three disciplines.\n\nThese areas do not need to be closely related. Combinations like language and mathematics, or geography and philosophy, can be equally valuable. Albert Einstein provides a famous example -- one of the most important physicists, who was also deeply engaged with music and played the violin from an early age.\n\nImplications for Policy and Practice\n\nThe authors argue that these insights should inform changes in how talent development programs are designed. Policymakers and program leaders can move toward approaches grounded in evidence rather than tradition.\n\nAs Güllich concludes, \"This may enhance opportunities for the development of world-class performers -- in science, sports, music, and other fields.\"", "language": "en", "category": "education", "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/education_learning.xml", "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:05:31 EST", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:50.532254"}

Reductions were seen in anxiety, depression, and ADHD, and girls experienced the greatest improvements.\n\nMental health care spending fell notably after schools reopened, reaching an 11 percent decrease by the ninth month.\n\nThis research represents one of the largest and most comprehensive analyses to date on how pandemic school closures affected children's mental health.\n\nSchool Reopening During COVID Linked to Better Mental Health for Children\n\nA new study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and collaborating institutions reports that children experienced far fewer mental health diagnoses when their schools reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reductions were seen across conditions such as anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Health care spending connected to these diagnoses also declined, and girls showed the strongest improvements.\n\nThe study was published on Dec. 8, 2025, in Epidemiology.\n\n\"Our results provide solid evidence to parents, educators, and policymakers that in-person school plays a crucial role in kids' well-being,\" said senior author Rita Hamad, professor of social epidemiology and public policy. \"The findings offer lessons for future public health emergencies and provide insight into why mental health worsened for children during the pandemic.\"\n\nBackground on Youth Mental Health During the Pandemic\n\nEarlier research consistently showed that children and teens struggled emotionally during COVID-19. Some studies suggested that returning to classrooms offered important support, but many of those investigations relied on small samples or self-reported experiences rather than comprehensive data.\n\nTo produce a more detailed picture, the research team examined health diagnoses and spending information for 185,735 children between the ages of five and 18 years from March 2020 through June 2021. The dataset indicated whether a child received mental health treatment or filled a prescription related to anxiety, depression, or ADHD. Participants lived in 24 counties and 224 school districts across California, a state where school closures lasted longer than in most of the country and reopening timelines varied widely. These differences created a natural opportunity to compare outcomes. Data came from the Healthcare Integrated Research Database, which includes individual-level commercial insurance claims, along with school-level administrative data from the California Department of Education.\n\nLarge Reductions in Diagnoses and Spending After Reopening\n\nThe study documented an overall rise in mental health diagnoses during the pandemic, increasing from 2.8% to 3.5%. However, children who returned to in-person school were substantially less likely to receive new diagnoses than peers whose schools stayed closed. By the ninth month after reopening, the chance of being diagnosed with a mental health condition had dropped by 43% compared with the period before reopening. This trend included fewer cases of anxiety, depression, and ADHD.\n\nHealth care spending reflected a similar pattern. Nine months after schools reopened, non-drug medical spending related to mental health was 11% lower, spending on psychiatric medications was 8% lower, and spending on ADHD-specific medications was 5% lower. Girls saw greater improvements than boys over the same period.\n\nHow School Closures May Have Affected Children\n\nThe research team outlined several possible reasons for the mental health challenges children experienced while schools were closed. These included limited social interaction, disrupted sleep routines, more screen time, poorer dietary patterns, academic struggles, family stress linked to economic hardship or increased time at home, and reduced access to school-based mental health services.\n\n\"As we consider future public health emergencies, this study suggests we need to prioritize safe school reopenings and ensure children have access to the social and emotional resources that schools provide,\" Hamad said. \"Policies should focus not only on infection control, but also on the mental wellbeing of children, recognizing that schools are a critical part of their support system.\"\n\nStudy Limitations and Future Directions\n\nThe authors noted that the study focused on children living in relatively higher-income areas in California who were enrolled in commercial insurance plans, meaning they generally had better access to health care. More research is needed to explore how school reopening influenced children in marginalized communities, where the impact may have been even more significant.\n\nThe study received funding from the National Institutes of Health (grant U01MH129968).", "language": "en", "category": "education", "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/education_learning.xml", "published": "Sat, 13 Dec 2025 08:28:15 EST", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:50.864284"}

These countries were chosen because they provide detailed data on child development, household living conditions, and climate, allowing researchers to estimate the amount of heat each child experienced.\n\nTo evaluate development, the team used the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI), which tracks milestones in four areas: reading and number-related skills (literacy and numeracy), social-emotional development, approaches to learning, and physical development. The researchers combined ECDI information with 2017-2020 data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), which include demographic and well-being indicators such as education, health, nutrition, and sanitation. By merging these datasets with climate records showing average monthly temperatures, they explored potential connections between heat exposure and early development.\n\nHigher Temperatures Linked to Missed Milestones\n\nThe researchers found that children who experienced average maximum temperatures above 86 °F (30 °C) were 5 to 6.7 percent less likely to meet basic literacy and numeracy benchmarks than children exposed to temperatures below 78.8 °F during the same season and in the same region. Children in economically disadvantaged households, homes with limited access to clean water, and densely populated urban areas showed the strongest impacts.\n\n\"We urgently need more research to identify the mechanisms that explain these effects and the factors that either protect children or heighten their vulnerability.

Insurance marketing often overshadows unbiased options like SHIP, leaving people unaware of better choices. Comparing real costs—not just premiums—can prevent unpleasant surprises, especially when provider networks or drug rules change. New assistance programs for low-income adults offer valuable help for 2026.", "content": "Right now, 68 million Americans have a deadline coming up: the deadline to decide their Medicare health coverage for next year if they’re over age 65 or have major disabilities.\n\nThey must make those decisions by December 7, for coverage beginning January 1, 2026, which makes this time, known as Medicare Open Enrollment, a very important time.\n\nAnd yet, University of Michigan research has shown that many people covered by Medicare don’t take key steps during Open Enrollment that could save them money, headaches and worry.\n\nBased on that research, here are five tips for everyone who has Medicare – and the family members and friends who can help them with their choices.\n\nUse the tools\n\nThe official Medicare website has a lot of easy-to-understand and straightforward tools to help anyone understand their Medicare coverage options, and explore the options open to them or their loved ones.\n\nBut only 33% of people with Medicare used the Internet at all to explore their options, according to a recent U-M study.\n\nThat’s even though the choices can be dizzying: many people have dozens of options. Nearly all people have more than 10 Medicare Advantage plans to choose from, as well as multiple Part D prescription drug and Medigap supplemental plans to choose from if they opt for traditional Medicare.\n\nThe Medicare Plan Compare site is the place to start, and you can start on the Your Medicare Options page.\n\nIt’s available even during the government shutdown, because the plan-navigation tools on it were built before the shutdown began.\n\nUsing the Plan Compare site, you can see which Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans serve your area, what services or drugs they cover, what they charge for monthly premiums and for copays and other costs when you get health care or fill a prescription, and what the plan’s overall star rating is.\n\nIf you have a Medicare Advantage plan now, using the Plan Compare tool will also show you if your current plan will still be available next year.\n\nSome plans are ending or combining with others.\n\nYou can also enter your prescription drug names and doses to see what they will cost you on different Part D plans, and whether pharmacies near you are in-network.\n\nThis includes the Part D drug coverage in many Medicare Advantage plans, as well as standalone Part D plans for people who choose traditional Medicare.\n\nU-M researchers showed that using the prescription drug tool to compare estimated costs could save people a lot of money.\n\nThey did the study before the annual cap on Medicare prescription costs took effect in 2025, but still feel it’s important for everyone with Medicare drug coverage to use the tool.\n\nIf you need help navigating the Plan Finder site, or signing up for an account that will help you get the most use out of it, don’t be afraid to ask a friend, family member or neighbor. Or use the independent help described in Tip 2, below.\n\n“Given changing clinical circumstances and the fact that insurance plan costs and benefits are often modified from year to year, it is very important that people with Medicare coverage use the available tools during Open Enrollment to identify a plan that best meets their medical needs and fits their financial situation,” said A. Mark Fendrick, M.D., director of U-M's center for Value Based Insurance Design.\n\nGet independent help\n\nHalf of people with Medicare get their coverage through Medicare Advantage plans run by insurance companies.\n\nAnd of the other half, who choose traditional Medicare, nearly half get Part D prescription drug plans and “Medigap” add-on plans from private insurance companies.\n\nThose insurance companies send out a lot of mail and email at this time of year, trying to persuade people to choose their plans.\n\nThey make phone calls, pay for advertising and even hold events where participants get a free meal in exchange for listening to the sales pitch for that plan.\n\nThey do all this because they make money on enrollees who are healthier and don’t use their insurance a lot.\n\nThen there are insurance brokers and agents – people who do one-on-one consultations, but are paid for every person they sign up for a particular company’s plan.\n\nWhile all of this can inform your decision, these aren’t independent sources of information. However, there is an independent source: your State Health Insurance Assistance Program, or SHIP.\n\nEach state has one, with paid staff and trained volunteers who don’t have a financial stake in which plan you choose.\n\nYou can find your state’s SHIP program here.\n\n“With the overwhelming number of plans and the vast amount of information available, it’s essential to remember that free help is available,” said Lianlian Lei, Ph.D., who has studied Medicare enrollment by older adults and is an assistant professor in the U-M Medical School’s Department of Psychiatry.\n\n“Seeking independent, unbiased assistance is crucial to making the best choice,” she added.\n\nBecause SHIP programs don’t have the marketing dollars that insurance companies and brokers do, many people don’t know about them.\n\nIn fact, a recent U-M poll showed that 75% of older adults have never heard of SHIP, and another 21% have heard of it but haven’t used it.\n\nOnly 4% of older adults had used SHIP services, even though they’re available for free to anyone eligible for Medicare.\n\nIn Michigan, anyone can reach the state SHIP program by calling 1-800-803-7174 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nYou’ll speak with an agent who can schedule an appointment or provide a referral to a trained, certified counselor in their community.\n\nNot only that, the staff at this help line, called MiOptions, can also help older adults and their caregivers find out what other assistance they might qualify for.\n\nYou may also find trained SHIP volunteers offering free in-person counseling sessions at your local public library or senior center; check the events listings to see if any are coming up and how to make an appointment.\n\nInterested in learning how to offer this kind of independent help to others as a SHIP volunteer? Visit this page.\n\nLook at the total package, not just the monthly premiums\n\nWhen choosing any insurance, a lot of people focus on the monthly premium, and not on the total package of coverage.\n\nThis is true for Medicare too.\n\nWhen you use the Medicare Plan Compare tool, you can see monthly premiums for different Medicare Advantage plans side-by-side.\n\nBut you can also see things like co-pays and other costs, which can vary a lot depending on how much health care a person actually uses.\n\nThe Plan Compare tool does not allow you to compare Medicare Advantage to traditional Medicare plus any add-on plans you choose.\n\nSo, you’ll want to note these costs for traditional Medicare, and then explore the Part D prescription drug plans and Medigap plans available in your area.\n\nAnd remember, even if a Medicare Advantage plan says it has a $0 premium, that’s just for the coverage it provides beyond Part B.\n\nUnless the plan includes a Part B premium reduction, which most don’t, you will still need to pay a monthly premium of at least $185, or more if you have a higher income.\n\nSometimes a plan with a higher monthly premium has lower out-of-pocket costs due at the time of care, or a lower cap on total out-of-pocket costs that you could owe each year.\n\nThe National Council on Aging has a great guide to all of these kinds of costs.\n\nWhen choosing a Part D prescription drug plan or a Medigap plan to go with traditional Medicare coverage, it’s also important to compare options, based on the medications you take or whether you travel a lot or live in a second location during part of the year.\n\nBut surprisingly, U-M research shows it isn’t cost but access to care providers, and dissatisfaction with quality of care, that drive most people to switch Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nAccess to care is also the biggest driver for people leaving Medicare Advantage to switch to traditional Medicare, the study found.\n\nThat’s why it’s important to look at the star ratings that Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription plans have earned from past members’ opinions of them.\n\nIt’s also important to look at the networks of hospitals, doctors and other providers that each Medicare Advantage plan will allow you to go to, or the restrictions on specific drug classes that Part D plans might impose.\n\nThis kind of information is only available on each plan’s website.\n\nThe same research team has also looked at Medicare’s “revolving door” and the patterns of switching to and from the different forms of Medicare.\n\nOne item they note: Most states do not require insurers to ensure that people have the right to purchase Medigap plans regardless of their health status, except for an initial period after they enroll in Medicare for the first time.\n\nThis can result in Medicare Advantage “lock-in” for individuals with costly care needs, meaning they are unable to obtain Medigap coverage to help offset high out-of-pocket costs in traditional Medicare.\n\nSo, if you have significant health issues and have been in a Medicare Advantage plan, but you are thinking of switching to traditional Medicare, it’s important to understand if you’ll be able to get an affordable Medigap plan to cover costs that traditional Medicare doesn’t cover.\n\nIf you have a low income, see if you’re eligible for extra assistance\n\nFor older adults and people with disabilities who have limited incomes, there are new programs and supports available for 2026, on top of the ones already in place in 2025.\n\nSome of them are automatic, but some require you to apply for them.\n\nYou can get help understanding all of the options open to you by contacting the SHIP program for your state (see above).\n\nBut here are some major ones to be aware of:\n\nYou can find out if there’s one serving your area, and whether you might qualify, using the Plan Compare tool or by contacting your state’s SHIP program.\n\nDon’t assume you and your spouse or partner should have the same plan\n\nIf you are married or live with a partner, your instinct might be to enroll in the same plan as them for convenience.\n\nBut that’s not always the best choice.\n\nYour health needs, and your spouse’s or partner’s needs, may be very different. One of you might be retired, the other working.\n\nOr maybe you have different coverage related to your past employment or military service.\n\nIf one of you has dementia, for instance, there may be special plans and programs that could cover more services.\n\nBut U-M research showed that people with and without dementia make very similar Medicare Advantage choices, which may mean they aren’t examining all their options.\n\nNo matter what your health status, and your spouse or partner’s health status, it’s still important to make individual choices when it comes to Medicare Open Enrollment.\n\nU-M research has shown, though, that many people with Medicare Advantage coverage are making changes to their coverage in sync with their spouse or partner.\n\nThe Medicare online tools don’t have a “couples” setting, so each person should go through the process by inputting their information.\n\nYou could seek SHIP counseling together, but you may have to make two appointments depending on the program in your area.\n\nBonus tip about Medicare enrollment\n\nEven if you make a choice during Medicare Open Enrollment, you may not be stuck with that choice for all of 2026.\n\nFor instance, if you choose a Medicare Advantage plan, but then realize in early 2026 that it’s not right for you, you will have until March 31 to choose a different Medicare Advantage Plan or move to traditional Medicare.\n\nAnd if you have a major change in your income, employment, address, or living situation during 2026, you may become eligible for a Special Enrollment Period that will allow you to change plans.\n\nThis article contains information based on research by, and expertise from, experts who are part of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, including Lianlian Lei, Ph.D., U-M Medical School Department of Psychiatry; Geoffrey Hoffman, Ph.D., U-M School of Nursing; Kristian Stensland, M.D., M.P.H., M.S., U-M Medical School Department of Urology; and A.

Despite the blunder, the map reshaped the Bible into a Renaissance book and spread new ideas about territorial organization as literacy expanded. Over time, sacred geography evolved into political boundary-making, influencing not only early modern thought but modern attitudes about nation-states.", "content": "The first Bible to include a map of the Holy Land appeared in 1525, exactly 500 years ago. The map had a major flaw: it was printed the wrong way round, showing the Mediterranean to the East. Despite this error, a new Cambridge study explains that the map's appearance in print helped set in motion ideas about territory and borders that still influence thinking today.\n\n\"This is simultaneously one of publishing's greatest failures and triumphs,\" says Nathan MacDonald, Professor of the Interpretation of the Old Testament at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\"They printed the map backwards so the Mediterranean appears to the east of Palestine. People in Europe knew so little about this part of the world that no one in the workshop seems to have realized. But this map transformed the Bible forever and today most Bibles contain maps.\"\n\nHow a Renaissance Map Reframed the Bible\n\nIn research published on November 29 in The Journal of Theological Studies, MacDonald argues that the map created by Lucas Cranach the Elder and printed in Zürich did more than update biblical layouts for the Renaissance. It also helped shape early thinking about territorial organization.\n\n\"It has been wrongly assumed that biblical maps followed an early modern instinct to create maps with clearly marked territorial divisions,\" MacDonald says. \"Actually, it was these maps of the Holy Land that led the revolution.\n\n\"As more and more people gained access to Bibles from the 17th century, these maps spread a sense of how the world ought to be organized and what their place within it was. This continues to be extremely influential.\"\n\nRare Survivors of the 1525 Edition\n\nVery few copies of Christopher Froschauer's 1525 Old Testament still exist. Trinity College Cambridge's Wren Library holds one of the remaining examples (see image).\n\nInside this edition, Cranach's map presents the stations of the wilderness wanderings and the division of the Promised Land into twelve tribal regions. These divisions were a distinctly Christian interpretation, expressing a claim to the sacred sites of both the Old and New Testaments. Cranach's work drew on medieval mapping traditions where Israel appeared as long, narrow strips of land, reflecting earlier reliance on the 1st century AD Jewish historian Josephus, who simplified conflicting biblical descriptions.\n\nAccording to MacDonald, \"Joshua 13-19 doesn't offer an entirely coherent, consistent picture of what land and cities were occupied by the different tribes. There are several discrepancies. The map helped readers to make sense of things even if it wasn't geographically accurate.\"\n\nMapping the Bible in the Swiss Reformation\n\nA literal interpretation of scripture was especially important in the Swiss Reformation, which is why, MacDonald explains, \"It's no surprise that the first Bible map was published in Zürich.\"\n\nMacDonald, a Fellow of St John's College Cambridge, notes that as interest in literal readings increased, maps became a tool to show that biblical events unfolded in identifiable places and real time.\n\nIn a Reformation context where certain religious images were restricted, maps of the Holy Land became acceptable visual aids and took on devotional significance.\n\n\"When they cast their eyes over Cranach's map, pausing at Mount Carmel, Nazareth, the River Jordan and Jericho, people were taken on a virtual pilgrimage,\" MacDonald says. \"In their mind's eye, they traveled across the map, encountering the sacred story as they did so.\"\n\nA Turning Point in the Bible's Long Evolution\n\nMacDonald argues that the addition of Cranach's map was a major milestone in the Bible's development and deserves more recognition. Other key moments include the shift from scrolls to bound books, the 13th century creation of the first portable one-volume Bible (The Paris Bible), the introduction of chapters and verses, new Reformation prefaces, and the 18th century recognition of prophetic writings as Hebrew poetry. \"The Bible has never been an unchanging book,\" MacDonald says. \"It is constantly transforming.\"\n\nHow Biblical Maps Helped Create Modern Borders\n\nIn medieval maps, the tribal divisions of the Holy Land symbolized spiritual inheritance for Christians. By the late fifteenth century, however, the lines originally drawn in biblical maps began spreading into maps of the wider world. These lines came to represent political borders. At the same time, these new ideas about political authority were read back into biblical texts.\n\n\"Bible maps delineating the territories of the twelve tribes were powerful agents in the development and spread of these ideas,\" MacDonald says. \"A text that is not about political boundaries in a modern sense became an instance of God's ordering of the world according to nation-states.\"\n\n\"Lines on maps started to symbolize the limits of political sovereignties rather than the boundless divine promises. This transformed the way that the Bible's descriptions of geographical space were understood.\"\n\n\"Early modern notions of the nation were influenced by the Bible, but the interpretation of the sacred text was itself shaped by new political theories that emerged in the early modern period. The Bible was both the agent of change, and its object.\"\n\nWhy These Ideas Still Matter\n\n\"For many people, the Bible remains an important guide to their basic beliefs about nation states and borders,\" MacDonald says. \"They regard these ideas as biblically authorized and therefore true and right in a fundamental way.\"\n\nMacDonald points to a recent US Customs and Border Protection recruitment film in which a border agent quotes Isaiah 6:8 -- 'Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \"Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?\"' -- while flying above the US-Mexico border in a helicopter.\n\nProfessor MacDonald is concerned that many people continue to treat modern borders as if they were clearly defined in scripture. \"When I asked ChatGPT and Google Gemini whether borders are biblical, they both simply answered 'yes'. The reality is more complex,\" he says.\n\n\"We should be concerned when any group claims that their way of organizing society has a divine or religious underpinning because these often simplify and misrepresent ancient texts that are making different kinds of ideological claims in very different political contexts.\"", "language": "en", "category": "education", "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/education_learning.xml", "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 09:01:30 EST", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:51.657666"}

{"title": "AI supercharges scientific output while quality slips", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032347.htm", "summary": "AI writing tools are supercharging scientific productivity, with researchers posting up to 50% more papers after adopting them. The biggest beneficiaries are scientists who don’t speak English as a first language, potentially shifting global centers of research power. But there’s a downside: many AI-polished papers fail to deliver real scientific value. This growing gap between slick writing and meaningful results is complicating peer review, funding decisions, and research oversight.", "content": "After ChatGPT became widely available in late 2022, many researchers started telling colleagues they could get more done with these new artificial intelligence tools. At the same time, journal editors reported a surge of smoothly written submissions that did not seem to add much scientific value.\n\nA new Cornell study suggests those informal reports point to a broader change in how scientists are preparing manuscripts. The researchers found that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can increase paper output, with especially strong benefits for scientists who are not native English speakers. But the growing volume of AI written text is also making it harder for key decision makers to tell meaningful work apart from low value content.\n\n\"It is a very widespread pattern, across different fields of science -- from physical and computer sciences to biological and social sciences,\" said Yian Yin, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. \"There's a big shift in our current ecosystem that warrants a very serious look, especially for those who make decisions about what science we should support and fund.\"\n\nThe findings appear in a paper titled \"Scientific Production in the Era of Large Language Models,\" published Dec. 18 in Science.\n\nHow the Cornell Team Measured AI Use in Research Papers\n\nTo examine how LLMs are influencing scientific publishing, Yin's team compiled more than 2 million papers posted from January 2018 through June 2024 across three major preprint platforms. Those sites are arXiv, bioRxiv and Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Together, they represent the physical sciences, life sciences and social sciences, and they host studies that have not yet been through peer review.\n\nThe researchers used papers posted before 2023 that were presumed to be written by humans and compared them with AI generated text. From that comparison, they built a model designed to flag papers that were likely written with help from LLMs. Using this detector, they estimated which authors were probably using LLMs for writing, tracked how many papers those scientists posted before and after adopting the tools, and then checked whether the papers were later accepted by scientific journals.\n\nBig Productivity Gains, Especially for Non Native English Speakers\n\nThe results showed a clear productivity jump linked to apparent LLM use. On arXiv, scientists flagged as using LLMs posted roughly one third more papers than those who did not appear to use AI. On bioRxiv and SSRN, the increase exceeded 50%.\n\nThe boost was largest for scientists who write in English as a second language and face extra hurdles when communicating technical work in a foreign language. For example, researchers affiliated with Asian institutions posted between 43.0% and 89.3% more papers after the detector suggested they began using LLMs, compared with similar researchers who did not appear to adopt the technology, depending on the preprint site. Yin expects the advantage could eventually shift global patterns of scientific productivity toward regions that have been held back by the language barrier.\n\nAI Search May Broaden What Scientists Cite\n\nThe study also pointed to a potential benefit during literature searches and citation building. When researchers look for related work to cite, Bing Chat -- described as the first widely adopted AI powered search tool -- performed better at surfacing newer papers and relevant books than traditional search tools. Traditional tools, by contrast, were more likely to return older and more heavily cited sources.\n\n\"People using LLMs are connecting to more diverse knowledge, which might be driving more creative ideas,\" said first author Keigo Kusumegi, a doctoral student in the field of information science. He plans future research to test whether AI use is associated with more innovative and interdisciplinary science.\n\nA New Problem for Peer Review and Research Evaluation\n\nEven as LLMs help individuals produce more manuscripts, the same tools can make it harder for others to judge what is truly strong science. In human written papers, clearer yet more complex writing, including longer sentences and bigger words, has often been a useful signal of higher quality research. Across arXiv, bioRxiv and SSRN, papers likely written by humans that scored highly on a writing complexity test were also the most likely to be accepted by journals.\n\nThat pattern looked different for papers likely written with LLM assistance. Even when those AI flagged papers scored high on writing complexity, they were less likely to be accepted by journals. The researchers interpret this as a sign that polished language may no longer reliably reflect scientific value, and that reviewers may be rejecting some of these papers despite strong sounding writing.\n\nYin said this gap between writing quality and research quality could have serious consequences. Editors and reviewers may struggle more to identify the most valuable submissions, while universities and funding agencies may find that raw publication counts no longer reflect scientific contribution.\n\nWhat Comes Next for Research on Generative AI\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these findings are observational. As a next step, they hope to test cause and effect using approaches such as controlled experiments, including designs where some scientists are randomly assigned to use LLMs and others are not.\n\nYin is also organizing a symposium on the Ithaca campus scheduled for March 3-5, 2026. The event will explore how generative AI is changing research and how scientists and policymakers can guide those changes.\n\nAs AI becomes more common for writing, coding and even generating ideas, Yin expects its influence to expand, effectively turning these systems into a kind of co scientist. He argues that policymakers should update rules to keep pace with the fast moving technology.\n\n\"Already now, the question is not, have you used AI? The question is, how exactly have you used AI and whether it's helpful or not.\"\n\nStudy Authors and Funding\n\nCo authors include Xinyu Yang, a doctoral student in the field of computer science; Paul Ginsparg, professor of information science in Cornell Bowers and of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, and founder of arXiv; and Mathijs de Vaan and Toby Stuart of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation.", "language": "en", "category": "education", "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/education_learning.xml", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:53:28 EST", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T15:27:48.179728"}
