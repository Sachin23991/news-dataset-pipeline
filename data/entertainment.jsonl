[&#8230;]", "content": "Theater owners are preparing for a very merry Christmas season.\n\nThis holiday might not be one for the record books, but the lineup of films offers something important — a range of genres and styles — as exhibitors brace for what’s usually the busiest stretch of the year. That’s an important distinction in post-COVID times. Since the pandemic, cinema operators have relied on one billion-dollar behemoth (“Spider-Man: No Way Home” in 2021 and “Avatar: The Way of Water” in 2022) or struggled with none at all (“Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” floundered in 2023 and while “Mufasa” rebounded after a soft start in 2024, “The Lion King” prequel couldn’t claw its way to the billion-dollar mark).\n\nThis year, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will continue to dominate but James Cameron’s sci-fi threequel won’t be alone in enticing audiences. Over the weekend, a trio of holiday releases — A24’s R-rated ping-pong adventure “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” — hope to cater to moviegoers young, old, or disinterested in returning to the alien planet of Pandora.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is aiming for $55 million to $65 million over the traditional weekend and $75 million to $80 million through the four-day holiday frame. Those ticket sales would mark a 30% to 40% decline from its $89 million domestic debut. For context, “Avatar: The Way of Water” dropped by 52% in its sophomore outing after a significantly stronger $134 million debut. Disney and 20th Century’s “Avatar” franchise appears be experiencing diminishing returns, though it’s important to remember these films aren’t known for explosive opening weekends. Instead, “Avatar” installments enjoy exceptional staying power, sticking around at the top of the box office for weeks on end. The first two films, which each ended up grossing over $2 billion globally, were No. 1 for seven consecutive weekends. Barring a surprise, “Fire and Ash” should remain atop the charts in North America well into the new year.\n\nIn terms of new releases, Jack Black and Paul Rudd’s “Anaconda” is expected to lead the pack with $20 million from 3,400 venues between Christmas on Thursday and Sunday. “Marty Supreme” is targeting $12 million to $20 million, while “Song Song Blue” is projected to earn $10 million to $14 million from 2,400 theaters. In general, Christmas releases don’t always deliver huge debuts but tend to play and play on the big screen into January and beyond.\n\n“Anaconda” cost $45 million to produce. A meta-reboot, “Anaconda” follows best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie (you guessed it!) 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down.\n\n“Marty Supreme” had a rollicking start in limited release, breaking into the top 10 with $875,000 while playing on just six screens. Those initial returns are promising ahead of the nationwide expansion, which will test the $70 million-budgeted film’s commercial viability. It helps that Timothée Chalamet, who stars as the fictional table tennis champ Marty Mauser, has been rewriting the rules of movie marketing in terms of getting out the word for an original film. “Marty Supreme” has generated great reviews and encouraging word of mouth. Now the question is: Will Chalamet’s viral antics translate to ticket sales?\n\n“Song Sung Blue” carries a modest $30 million production budget. Craig Brewer directed the film, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band. Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman praised “Song Sung Blue” as “a winning pop nostalgia trip with a dark side.”\n\nWith just two weeks to go, overall domestic revenues are hovering at $8.37 billion, just 1.3% ahead of last year and 22.4% behind 2019, according to Comscore. It’s been a wobbly year with several hits (“Lilo & Stitch,” “Zootopia 2,” “A Minecraft Movie” and “Demon Slayer,” among others) but not enough to offset a number of big-budget flops (“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” and “Snow White,” to name a few). Projections for 2025 were already revised down to $9 billion, but after a brutal fall season, even that milestone feels like a stretch. Will these holiday offerings be able to deliver, or is the box office doomed to fall short of $9 billion for the second consecutive year?", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:52.942238"}

But the [&#8230;]", "content": "If all you know or remember of the eponymous biblical character’s story is that he defeated a hulking giant with a humble slingshot, then “David” might have some surprises in store for you — chief among them, the fact that the film continues for a full hour after this famous, seemingly climactic showdown. But the films of Angel Studios, by and large, are not for audiences only vaguely acquainted with the Bible, and this surprisingly slick animated feature will play best with viewers who can see its every narrative turn coming. That is a sizeable demographic: Released wide last weekend, Brent Dawes and Phil Cunningham‘s film overperformed notably at the box office, landing in the runner-up spot to “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” and aptly defeating relative toon Goliath “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.”\n\nThis is all a perfectly on-the-nose outcome for a tale preaching the message that one must never underestimate the modest and pious when they’re up against the wealthy and decadent. (Or whatever moral descriptor applies to SpongeBob.) But “David” attains its success by cribbing from the playbook of far mightier animation houses: There are shades here of Disney and DreamWorks — the latter’s scripture-based hit “The Prince of Egypt,” in particular — in everything from the film’s character design to its original song score, making for a proficient family entertainment that’s nonetheless a little too precision-engineered to feel truly stirring. Faith, “David” has in spades; soul, not so much.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWith Pixar-wide eyes and a mop of intricately tousled, treacle-brown hair, the young David (voiced by Brandon Engman) presents here as a plucky, intrepid moppet in the typical cartoon-hero mold. He’s introduced as a keen musician and lowly shepherd’s son, dutifully minding his father’s flock on the outskirts of Bethlehem, before swiftly launching into his generic “I want” song, the first of several peppily template-based but swiftly forgettable compositions by Grammy-winning Christian artist Jonas Myrin. Like any cutely drawn protagonist in his position, he yearns for bigger things, though he gets more than he bargained for when — after valiantly protecting his sheep from a preying lion — he’s summoned before the Prophet Samuel (Brian Stivale), who anoints the nonplussed lad the future king of Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, the present king, the insecure and short-tempered Saul (Adam Michael Gold), is facing rejection by God and a declaration of war by preening Philistine monarch King Achish (British comedian Asim Chaudhry, offering something of a throwback to limp-wristed comic stereotypes). Enter David, brought into Saul’s court to soothe the king’s anxieties with his deft lyre-playing, though the tyke soon proves an unexpected military asset: Cue the famed face-off against Goliath, which is quite dazzlingly staged in a vast field of scarlet poppies, petals spraying like confetti when the iceberg-sized monster hits the ground.\n\nTaking place around the 50-minute mark, this scene proves both the narrative and aesthetic peak of a film that, clocking in at an indifferently paced 110 minutes, could test the patience of younger children. Everything that happens after, as David grows into a strapping, stout-hearted man (now voiced by Christian singer-songwriter Phil Wickham) and eventually challenges Saul for the throne that is rightly his, is checked off in fairly rote fashion. Expanding on their 2023 Angel Studios miniseries “Young David,” Dawes and Cunningham obviously hew closely to the Book of Samuel — this isn’t the genre for significant creative license — but also to the familiar rules of any Hollywood hero’s journey.\n\nNone of which would be a debit if their David had a little more personality of his own, but he remains a stubbornly dull anchor for the film, bound by the generally humorless, declamatory tone of the writing. Supporting characters are similarly lacking in wit or detail, while the film’s vocal performances (save for Chaudhry’s odd caricature) are adequate but not especially distinctive. It follows that the faces on screen are perhaps the least characterful element of the film’s generally impressive visual design.\n\nEverything around them, however, is vividly realized, and occasionally even inspired. “David” is nothing if not a spectacular showcase for the technical capabilities of South African animation house Sunrise Productions — demonstrated here both at a large scale, in the palpably dusty, sun-scorched vistas of ancient Israel, and in small, supple glimmers of fire and water. One musical number, “Tapestry,” registers as a standout not for the song but for its visual treatment amid a busy weaving workshop overhung by cotton-candy bales of pastel-dyed wool. Indeed, textiles are perhaps the most consistent marvel of “David,” as even the ecru hessian of the title character’s shepherding smock is rendered with textured, tactile specificity. Reveling in the material may go somewhat against the film’s principles, but respecting the little things does not.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:28:54 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:53.215189"}

Joyce Beatty (D-OH) filed the lawsuit on Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeking a declaration that the name of the arts institution is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and that a board vote last week to change the name is null and void.\n\n“Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center’s name requires an act of Congress,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “But on December 18 and 19, 2025—in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic—the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order. Congress intended the Center to be a living memorial to President Kennedy—and a crown jewel of the arts for all Americans, irrespective of party. Unless and until this Court intervenes, Defendants will continue to defy Congress and thwart the law for improper ends.”\n\nThe Trump controlled board voted to rename the center on Thursday. The next day, workers added Trump’s name to the facade of the complex, so it reads “The Donald Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe lawsuit named Trump, who is chairman of the Kennedy Center, as well as its president, Ric Grenell, and the members of the board, along with the institution itself. Also named are other ex officio members, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr., House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nThe lawsuit cited breach of trustees obligations under federal law and violation of plaintiff’s rights under federal law, among other claims.\n\nBeatty also is seeking an order that “any and all physical and digital signage purporting to\n\nrename the Kennedy Center after Defendant Trump, including the signage on the building’s\n\nfront portico and the website.”\n\nThe center did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Beatty’s lawsuit.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed a law in 1964 designating the National Cultural Center as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. After the Trump-controlled board voted, Democrats and members of the Kennedy family quickly cried foul.\n\nThe lawsuit called the board vote a “sham.”\n\n“The conduct in the Board meeting itself confirmed that the meeting was a sham, orchestrated by Defendant Trump and his loyalists as a pretext for a predetermined result,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “There was no advance notice in the agenda that the Board would be considering a name change. The meeting was held at the home of Andrea Wynn, the wife of a casino mogul and Republican donor, whom Defendant Trump installed on the Board. At the end of the meeting, Defendant Trump’s loyalists abruptly announced that they had news they would like to share: the Kennedy Center would now be renamed after Donald Trump.”\n\nBeatty was on the board meeting call, but was blocked from expressing her concerns because she was put on mute, according to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center later said that ex officio members do not have a vote, something codified in the center’s bylaws.\n\nBut Beatty’s lawsuit contended that the “law does not distinguish between the ex officio trustees and general trustees, and the former possess the same rights and responsibilities as the latter.”\n\nRoma Daravi, spokeswoman for the center, defended the board’s authority to change the name. “This action is in line with the precedent of the State Department adding President Trump’s name to the Institute of Peace. And the previous Administration renaming military bases,” she said in a statement last week. Yet the effort to strip military bases of Confederate names was authorized by an act of Congress in 2021, something that critics of the Kennedy Center renaming say is required.\n\nThe lawsuit also contended that the “purported name change will impose financial and operational harms on this already struggling institution by alienating ticket holders, donors, and artists.” The lawsuit noted that after the name change, musician Kristy Lee announced that she was canceling her Jan. 14, 2026 performance. “On information and belief, ticket holders have canceled their tickets in protest of Defendants’ unlawful actions and demanded refunds. There is every reason to expect this trend will continue, with associated financial and reputational harms,” the lawsuit stated.\n\nBeatty is represented by Norman Eisen, founder of Democracy Defenders Action, and Nathaniel Zelinsky, senior counsel at Washington Litigation Group.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 02:50:25 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:55.164916"}

The experimental drama examines the social pressures of competitive sports, the use of technology and social media applied to sports, and the link between sports and war, providing a fresh and realistic look at contemporary athletic agonism.\n\nThe film stars Italian judo athlete and Olympic Gold medalist Alice Bellandi and “La Chimera” stars Yile Vianello and Sofija Zobina.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFollowing its premiere in the Venice Film Festival’s Critics’ Week in September, “Agon” was released in Italian cinemas, kicking off Mubi’s Italian theatrical release slate, and has travelled widely on the festival circuit including the Rio, Thessaloniki, Geneva, and Brisbane fests.\n\nBertelli speaks to Variety about his personal connection to the film’s subject matter and how he brought Mubi and The Match Factory on board as producer, Italian theatrical distributor, and global distributor.\n\nYou’ve been involved with the Italian sailing team that competed in the America’s Cup. Is that what prompted you to depict the world of highly competitive sports?\n\nYes, I definitely have a personal connection to this film. But there is also a broader context. It’s true that “Agon” is centred around the world of sports. And of course it’s open to interpretations. But I also use the sports world backdrop of these fictional Olympics that are almost a geopolitical platform, to make a reflection on the role that competitive sports have taken on over the past century. And also to talk more in general about the feeling in life of not being able to achieve one’s goal. So, at one level it’s also the story of three teenagers who are unable to do what they want. This is observed very differently with respect to each character, ​​contextualising this journey in the preparation for competition in a minor sports category of a hypothetical Olympics. Then there’s the broader issue of macro connections between how we came to call sports what they are today. Where does that comes from? And the relationship between war, violence, and sports.\n\nTalk to me about your decision to cast real life world champion judo athlete Alice Bellandi in the film.\n\nI initially conceived “Agon” as an animation project. Then, when I decided to make it live-action, I had two big problems. One was: how do I give it a realistic flavour that establishes trust with the audience? For fencing, I knew I could use a stunt person because in fencing you wear a mask. With shooting, I also knew that it was not a big problem because the athlete has to be very still. But when it comes to judo, I knew I had to find a real judoka. Then reality surpassed my expectations when I met Bellandi, who agreed to be in the film. Then five months after we shot she won the Olympic gold medal in Paris.\n\nIn simplistic terms, “Agon” explores the relationship between sports and technology, which is very clear in competitive sailing. Talk to me about how you weaved this into the film’s narrative.\n\nI’m interested in the relationship between sports and technology, but in a broader sense, which is what I think I’ll continue to look at in the future. What really interests me is the rapport between the organic world and technology, “organic” pertaining to the body in this movie. One example is the surgery [scene] in the film, which is obviously a very crude scene. For me it’s very important because it’s not a metaphor. There are other directors who have addressed this theme [of technology and the body] using metaphorical devices that have shaped my imagination. But I’m fascinated by looking at this [rapport] where it doesn’t exist as a metaphor, but exists purely as reality: a robot that digs into the flesh, into the blood.\n\nTalk to me about your relationship with Mubi. How did you bring them on board in such a big way?\n\nActually, Mubi was involved in “Agon” since the beginning, before anyone else. When I wrote this story as an animation project, I wasn’t actually actively trying to get this film off the ground. I met Efe Cackarel in 2017 when Mubi was much smaller than it is now. We talked about it. I mentioned that I had this story in mind and I’d like to maybe make movies in the future. He said: “I’m interested. I’m also interested in starting to produce in the future and not just be a platform. Why don’t you write the screenplay?” So I wrote the screenplay and started talking about it directly with Mubi. At first we started developing it directly in London as an animation film, but then we realised that it would be too expensive and complex to do it as an animation project.\n\nMeanwhile, my life was changing. I thought: “maybe this could actually be my first feature film. And Efe, rightly, said to me: “Look, you need you to find a producer to take this project forward. But we are on board.” So, with [Italian producer] Max Brun, I introduced myself to Jules Daley, who had just come out of RSA Films. She loved the project and decided to help me and become my producer on this film. So, little by little, “Agon” was born. Then, when the project began to take shape, Mubi came on board. From the very beginning, there was the idea that they would distribute it. But they also became an equity investor. At that point, Mubi had acquired, or was in the process of acquiring, The Match Factory. So, to my great joy, I found myself working with The Match Factory as an international sales agent. Then they said: “Instead of selling the project, we’ll distribute it directly in Italy, because they wanted to start distributing in Italy.”\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:15:22 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T15:30:56.043423"}

In a twist, Captain America is the father to a newborn child.\n\nMarvel is slowly building up to “Doomsday,” which hits theaters in a little less than a year. There will reportedly be more teasers that focus on other characters in the coming weeks. The Captain America trailer leaked online in the run-up to its theatrical debut, and a Thor-focused teaser also appeared in social media leaks this week. It’s expected that it too will run in theaters with showings of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” beginning Thursday, like the Cap teaser.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nJoe and Anthony Russo, who previously directed “Captain America: Winter Soldier,” “Captain America: Civil War,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame” and are back for “Doomsday,” released a short statement on their Instagram page.\n\n“The character that changed our lives,” they wrote of Captain America. “The story that brought us all here together. It was always going to come back to this…”\n\nThe teaser, set on a peaceful farm, begins with Steve riding a motorcycle up to his home as a piano rendition of the “Avengers” theme plays in the background. His blue helmet is reminiscent of his Captain America costume, which he pulls out to reminiscently admire. He holds a newborn baby and looks proudly, as the teaser ends with “Steve Rogers will return for ‘Avengers: Doomsday.'” A countdown timer begins at the end that’s set to expire when “Doomsday” hits theaters.\n\nMarvel fans last saw Captain America, the founding Avenger, in the closing moments of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.” After saving the world from the purple villain known as Thanos, Cap makes it his personal mission to return the missing Infinity Stones to their rightful places across time. After finishing his time-traveling mission, an elderly Steve returns to the main MCU timeline and passes down his red-and-white Vibranium shield to his former sidekick, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), upgrading him from the Falcon to the new Captain America. After bestowing his shield to Sam, Steve then goes back in time to reunite with his beloved Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).\n\nAfter Steve went missing and was frozen in the ice in the original “Captain America” movie, Peggy grew old but never stopped loving him. Now with the Quantum Realm time-traveling technology, the two were able to get married and live out their lives together through the decades.\n\nDoes this teaser mean that Steve somehow returns to the main MCU timeline to rejoin the Avengers? Is this the same Cap, or is he a variant of the elderly hero from the finale of “Endgame”? And who’s the baby. Does he or she have super-soldier powers like Cap?\n\nMarvel also dropped the first poster for “Doomsday,” tinged in a green hue very similar to the colors of Doctor Doom’s famous costume.\n\nTechnically, this isn’t Evans’ first time back in the MCU since “Endgame.” In 2024’s billion-dollar smash “Deadpool & Wolverine,” he returned for a hilarious cameo as the Human Torch, his original superhero role way back in Fox’s “Fantastic Four” movie from 2005.\n\nIn an Esquire profile of Mackie from earlier this year, ahead of the former Falcon taking on the Cap mantle in “Captain America: Brave New World,” Evans said that he was “happily retired” and denied reports that he would return to Marvel.\n\n“That’s not true,” Evans said about his rumored return at the time, explaining that these reports “happen every couple years” since he bowed out in “Endgame.”\n\n“I’ve just stopped responding to it,” he added. “Yeah, no — happily retired!”\n\nEvans isn’t the only original “Avengers” star who will be back for “Doomsday.” Robert Downey Jr. is returning, but not as Tony Stark. Instead, he is replacing his Iron Man armor to play the ultimate villain, Doctor Doom, in the multiverse-crossing movie. Other returning heroes include Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Mackie, Danny Ramirez, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Tom Hiddleston, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Simu Liu, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen and Lewis Pullman.

(Thus, one might’ve expected Cameron to slip a little Na’vi into the interview, not French.)\n\nBut no matter what language he speaks, the filmmaker makes it known he’s not keen to discuss the future of the franchise — at least, not until the box office returns have been counted.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“We’re getting ahead of ourselves because, first of all, we’ve got to make some money with this one,” Cameron says. “Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business case yet again.\n\n“The world has changed. We all know the stats, where theatrical is. It’s been a bad year,” he goes on. “It’s starting to perk up a little bit with a couple of recent releases: ‘Wicked: For Good’ has done well, and ‘Zootopia 2’ is doing well. So, we’ll see.”\n\nCameron is not being modest; he’s a pragmatist. His “Avatar” movies — about the adventures of Marine turned Na’vi leader Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), Na’vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their family — come with significant box office expectations. The original 2009 film and its 2022 sequel, “The Way of Water,” stand as two of the highest-grossing movies in history, with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. “Fire and Ash” earned a strong $345 million globally in its opening weekend, but that figure is down from “The Way of Water’s” $435 million start.\n\nAs Variety’s Rebecca Rubin explains in her box office analysis, Disney spent a massive $350 million to produce the threequel and roughly $150 million to promote it, meaning the big-budget blockbuster needs to deliver in terms of ticket sales for Cameron to move forward with his planned fourth and fifth installments. (For the record, “Avatar 4” is slated for Dec. 2029 and a significant portion of the film has already been shot, while “Avatar 5” is expected to debut Dec. 2031.)\n\nIn the meantime, “Avatar” super fans can also enjoy the making-of documentary, “Fire and Water,” where Cameron reveals how his groundbreaking performance capture process really works. Here, Cameron reflects on how the Disney+ documentary is changing the conversation around performance capture, particularly in the age of generative artificial intelligence, and more about making the new movie, like introducing Oona Chaplin’s villainous Varang and just how spicy her relationship with Quaritch (Stephen Lang) was intended to be.\n\nYou’ve said that you’re always a little nervous before these movies come out. Are you feeling a little better now?\n\nIt’s a good first step. People are responding well. I hadn’t seen it with a big audience before [the premiere], because we’ve done these small press screenings, and I don’t really go to those. There’s some laughs.\n\nDid any of those laughs surprise you?\n\nThe strength of a couple of them surprised me. And then there’s some applause too. There are moments that appear to be quite cathartic for the audience — some of the quieter, emotional stuff. For that, I just look at my wife, Suzy [Amis]; if she’s grabbing her tissues, then I know the scene’s working. It’s a little harder to read that in a big room.\n\nThe crowd applauded for Zoe Saldaña’s performance as Neytiri. You’ve described her work on the “Avatar” movies as “ferocious,” and since we last spoke, she’s won an Oscar [for “Emilia Pérez”]. Do you think pulling the curtain back on how performance capture technology works helps audiences appreciate her performance differently?\n\nThat’s a really great way to put it. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing. I’ve hidden the performance capture methodology because I thought, “I don’t want to see people in a performance capture suit. I want them to think that the characters are real.” Right? But it’s been such a disservice to these actors who are doing some of the best work in their careers. I’ve got Kate Winslet, Academy Award winner; Zoe Saldaña won an Academy Award last year; Sigourney Weaver, a highly respected actress, nominated multiple times. And I just think, “Why am I hiding this under a bushel here? I should be celebrating it.”\n\nJames Cameron (right) directing Zoe Saldaña and Sam Worthington on the set of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Mark Fellman\n\nWe just take all the cinematography — all the cameras and the lenses and the lighting and all that stuff — and we just shove it into the future. It’s like black box theater or a stage rehearsal. A lot of my cast have done theater, and they go, “Oh, this is like, standing up a play.” It’s that quiet, intimate exploration. Everybody said, “Well, how can they possibly do that without all the sets and all the wardrobe?” Well, actors live in their imagination, right? And we give them the things they need. Sigourney said, “I’d really like to have a shawl or something that I can kind of pull around myself and hide behind as this kind of sulky and misunderstood teenager.” It’s like, “Sure, no problem.” It’s a wonderful process. And as a writer-director who’s created these characters, handing that baton to the actors, and then seeing what they do with it, there’s nothing better.\n\nI learned that Sigourney, who plays Kiri, the Sullys’ adopted teenage daughter, actually narrates the next one.\n\nThat could be the case. We’re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nOona Chaplin’s character, Varang, who leads the Ash people, steals the show. But her relationship with Quaritch takes a sexier turn than some people might expect. There’s a mutual seduction, but did you ever consider showing a Na’vi sex scene?\n\nWe never really shot anything beyond what you see. Let’s put it that way. We knew what we were going for was an undercurrent of sensuality, and it’s a PG-13 movie as well.\n\nThe bigger question is, why did we spend 10 minutes — which is an eternity in screen time — not on our main characters, not on our protagonist characters? And the answer is very simple: Because it was cool. That’s my ultimate modus operandi. If it’s cool, we’re gonna explore it. And I’m very proud of that scene where he goes to her, and they go inside the tent, and they tussle over the power. It’s a fun scene.\n\nOona Chaplin as Varang in “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” 20TH CENTURY STUDIOS\n\nMuch like Zoe, this film is a showcase for Oona’s talent. Many people know her from “Game of Thrones” [Chaplin played Talisa Maegyr, Robb Stark’s ill-fated wife], but this is her big screen breakout moment.\n\nI didn’t know who Oona was when I cast her in 2016; I certainly hadn’t seen [“Game of Thrones.”]. But she had such a grasp of the character. Oona herself is just a very warm, beautiful, heartfelt person, almost the exact opposite [of Varang]. But isn’t that fun to play the opposite and find you have the ability to play that. It can be a little scary.\n\nThat’s that actor-director connection that you like to explore.\n\nIn an age of Gen AI chomping at the film industry, that’s another reason I’m pulling back the curtain to show that this is an actor-centric, artist-centric process, and we don’t use those tools. Historically, we haven’t used it at all.\n\nI’m curious about what it can do that’s done ethically and constructively. I don’t want to replace actors, even though people are stampeding to [saying,] “Oh, I can make a film in my mom’s basement, and I don’t need to pay any actors. How cool is that?”\n\nI’ve been mentoring some young filmmakers in New Zealand in a short film class, and I saw presentations for seven projects. All seven of them showed us their storyboards, their pre-viz, their music choices, their mood board, their character design. Not one of the presentations mentioned their cast. Afterwards, I said, “Guys, what the hell is going on here? You didn’t lead with your actors. Do you have actors?” [They said,] “Well, yeah.” And I said, “Why didn’t you lead with that?” I said, “You know what you all need to do when you get your films done? Go do some acting.” I think every director should do some acting. There’s a lot of acting in directing.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:19.742509"}

Fox is one of Hollywood’s most infamous re-castings, it turns out that decision led to a second firing. Hardin was originally cast as Marty’s girlfriend Jennifer Parker.\n\n“‘Back to the Future’ was a huge disappointment. I was 17, you know. I burst into tears,” Hardin told EW. “It was very sad. There were quite a few of those that I remember, you know, things that never really got made. But that I remember being very tough.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHardin revealed earlier this year that she also got the boot from “Back to the Future” when Stoltz was fired because studio executives thought she was too tall to star opposite Michael J. Fox. She explained: “It was apparently the two female executives at the time that thought that it was emasculating for their lead male character to be in scenes with a woman that was taller than him. If I had done it, I’m sure it would have all gone in a different way. I wouldn’t have done ‘The Office.'”\n\n“To be where I am, you have to have failed more than you’ve succeeded,” Hardin now told EW. “I think people don’t realize that when they look at it from the outside — you have to really be somebody who’s comfortable with failure, and with putting yourself on the line all the time. That failure doesn’t mean anything about you. You just have to fail better, and keep failing better … to be able to really weather this career choice.”\n\nStoltz and Hardin were in production for six weeks on “Back to the Future” when the decision was made to boot Stoltz and recast the lead role with the director’s first choice, Fox, who had originally been blocked from the film due to his commitment to the NBC sitcom “Family Ties.” Hardin was replaced by Claudia Wells. Fox revealed in his new memoir, “Future Boy,” that he wrote a letter to Stoltz asking to finally meet 40 years after the recasting.\n\n“Eric has maintained his silence on the subject for 40 years, so I was prepared for the likelihood that he’d prefer to keep it that way,” Fox writes in the memoir, noting the two had never come face to face to discuss the casting swap. Fox wrote to him: “If your answer is ‘piss off and leave me alone’… That works, too.”\n\nStoltz responded with a “beautifully written reply” that “began, ‘Piss off and leave me alone!’ Thankfully, this was followed by ‘I jest…’ Eric was thoughtful about my outreach, and although he respectfully declined to participate in the book, he seemed open to the idea of getting together.”\n\nWhen Fox and Stoltz finally found themselves together in the same room, the actors “immediately fell into an easy dialogue about our careers, families, and yes, our own trips through the space-time continuum,” Fox writes. “[Stoltz entered] with a smile, and we quickly acknowledged that neither of us had an issue with the other. What transpired on ‘Back to the Future’ had not made us enemies or fated rivals; we were just two dedicated actors who had poured equal amounts of energy into the same role. The rest had nothing to do with us. As it turned out, we had much more in common than our spin as Marty.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:06:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:19.981063"}

Tickets, according to the suit, “were massively discounted for patrons who identified as black, indigenous, or people of color.

It initially started out to be the studio’s desire to remake or “reimagine” their 1997 horror movie of the same name that starred Ice Cube, Jon Voight, and Jennifer Lopez among others and dealt with a National Geographic film crew hijacked by an insane hunter in his quest to bag an elusive giant snake. Studios naturally love to find a way to just repeat their successful IP and Anaconda was enough of a hit to think about a reboot all these years later. If Jumanji keeps working for Sony, why can’t this one also? And director Tom Gormican and his co-screenwriter Kevin Etten had a unique idea, quite an inspired one. Previously they had paired on the very funny 2022 comedy, The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent with Nicolas Cage playing a whacked out version of Nicolas Cage.\n\nSimilarly their pitch for this one was to turn it into a comedy vehicle, that also takes satirical shots at the movie business. Two down-on-their-luck guys come to a point in life where they team up to do a remake of their favorite movie as teenagers, Anaconda. Take a sharp premise for laughs and add in the first-ever teaming of Paul Rudd and Jack Black, and you have a recipe for a LOL good time at the movies. Comedy has been in short supply of late, and this one is sort of sneaking in at the end of a year where a traditional movie comedy is suddenly an endangered species. Naked Gun ably filled the bill over the summer, and I loved Aziz Ansari’s Good Forturne with Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves also in the cast, but that one sadly opened and closed this Fall without making much of an impression on audiences. There just aren’t that many comedies that aren’t also masquerading as something else. This one just wants to make you laugh. It does.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHere Gormican switches up the expected casting by making Black largely the straight man to Rudd’s crazier friend. Doug McCallister (Black) is a frustrated filmmaker stuck in a dead-end job as a wedding videographer, always wanting to sell his blockbuster tentpole ideas to the bride and groom who just only want the traditional treatment, not the blood and gore he has in mind. Ronald Griffin Jr, aka Griff (Rudd) is a failed actor with a few small credits, most notably a 4 episode arc on Swat, who gets fired from his latest job and then comes up with the idea to call Griff, get their school cameraman Kenny (Steve Zahn) and Griff’s ex-girlfriend Claire (Thandiwe Newton) back together to go to the Amazon and do a low budget remake of Anaconda, which through happenstance somehow Doug claims he has the remake rights.\n\nWith a reluctant Doug finally aboard after his wife Malie (Ione Skye) convinces him to live the dream, they all leave Buffalo for the snake infested waters of Brazil’s Amazon. After getting a boat and a captain, Ana (Daniela Melchior) the first order of duty is sign on a title star, and they get one, a professional huge anaconda named Heitor who comes with his trainer and best friend, a local named Santiago (Selton Mello). Though Heitor is claimed to be no more harmful than a puppy, there are some moments of fright for Griff who is a little uneasy acting opposite him and at one point panics and tosses him overboard resulting in Heitor’s gruesome demise. Santiago is distraught and wracked with grief while Doug and Griff now have to figure out how to replace their star with another snake to keep this production afloat. Well isn’t the Amazon full of these things? They will find one. Not a good idea when suddenly the real thing starts to eat everyone for dinner.\n\nWith Australia’s Queensland coast standing in the Amazon, Gormican skillfully milks all the inherent humor in the situation while also not letting the horror aspects of the original film overtake this one, at least not enough to threaten a PG13 rating. Thankfully he has this cast and a teaming of Rudd and Black who never go into Abbott & Costello territory with the premise but create likeable characters trying to find the spark of life and creative worth they once had in school. And although Black is largely playing it pretty straight he does have a killer signature scene involving a Wild Boar carcass attached to his back as bait for the real anaconda. Priceless Jack Black stuff.

It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions.\n\n\n\nTo commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood.\n\n\n\nAfter months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment.\n\n\n\nNotice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming.\n\n\n\nWe intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news.\n\n\n\nWhen you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line.\n\n\n\nAlso, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion.\n\n\n\nWe also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options.\n\n\n\nVariety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here.\n\n\n\nSpoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs.

Just a few weeks ago, she appeared in Rachel Sennott’s new comedy series, I Love LA, which has already been renewed for a second season. And now, the world is about to see her opposite Timothée Chalamet in Josh Safdie‘s much-anticipated A24 film Marty Supreme.\n\nSo, where did she come from? When we meet via Zoom, A’zion addresses this right away, saying, “It’s really funny, because I’m seeing a lot of these things online of people being like, ‘Odessa A’zion just came out of nowhere and she’s an industry plant.’ And I’m like, ‘I’ve been acting for 10 years now.’”\n\nVery early roles included an episode of her mom Pamela Adlon’s show Better Things, and in the past few years, A’zion has been in the Dakota Johnson-starrer Am I OK?, the comedy series Ghosts, and this year the films Pools and Until Dawn. It was this last she was shooting in Budapest when she found an old phone booth and used it to record a self-tape audition for Marty Supreme — a scene in which her character, Rachel Mizler, is in a 1950s-era phone booth negotiating with the owner of a dog Marty is holding for ransom (yes, you read that correctly).\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nRachel is crazy in love with Chalamet’s Marty Mauser — a ping pong king and hustler extraordinaire, loosely based on a real person named Marty Reisman. Ultimately, both Rachel and Marty will reveal a level of determination that leans towards the twisted. Here, A’zion reveals how she persevered through a long period of not booking anything, how a long-ago Euphoria audition led to the role of Rachel and how her acting style blended with Chalamet’s approach.\n\nDEADLINE: Last time we met it was at a panel onstage at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival and we talked about I Love LA.\n\nI think that was my first ever [on-stage Q&A]. That’s not true. I had done it once before, for Pools, but that felt like my first ever panel in front of a big audience like that.\n\nDEADLINE: Since then, you’ve been doing a lot of interviews. The last few months must have been very intense in the run-up to the Marty Supreme premiere. How are you coping with it?\n\nIt has definitely been crazy. It’s definitely a new thing I’d never experienced before. How am I coping with it? I’m learning the ways. I’m trying to get past anxieties of talking to big groups of people. That’s scary. I have stage fright, so that’s really hard. Which I know maybe just goes away with experience of getting on stage more, but I never wanted to get on stage in front of people because it’s scary as hell. But I’m just excited that people are getting to see the show and the movie and projects that I care so deeply about. So if that means me having to do that, then I’m happy to be a part of it.\n\nOdessa A’zion in ‘Marty Supreme’ A24\n\nDEADLINE: Tell me about the process of getting the role of Rachel in Marty Supreme? I know that you sent in some self-tapes you made in a Hungarian phone booth.\n\nI feel like for me personally, and when I first started acting and doing my own thing, I feel like I didn’t book anything for a really long time, I don’t know. It took a really long time for me to book something. And it really didn’t happen until I started making my tapes my own and dressing as the character, what I thought the character would look like, versus people telling me, “Just wear neutral colors, go with a blank background.” And when I first started, it was in person too anyway, so it was whatever background they had. But self-tapes, I feel like are so special because you really have an opportunity to make it your own and make it as realistic as you want to make it. And if I didn’t find a phone booth, I was going to find a way to find a phone booth.\n\nI sent the tape a sh-t-ton of times, a bunch of different tapes over the course of a couple days. And I memorized that faster than I’ve ever memorized anything in my life.\n\nDEADLINE: Because the audition was the scene where Rachel’s in the phone booth in the movie…\n\nYeah. Which I think is way worse in the movie than my audition was. But yeah, it was a tape that had come about. I had met with Josh beforehand and Jennifer [Venditti, casting director] remembered me from my audition for Euphoria years ago and thought that I was right for this role, and was trying to tell Josh that she felt that she found his Rachel. And at first, when I met with him, he thought I was maybe too young and it didn’t go my way. And then a couple months later, it came back around and I was able to send the tape. I sent an improv portion, I sent an interview portion. And I mean, I sent the tape a sh-t-ton of times, a bunch of different tapes over the course of a couple days. And I memorized that faster than I’ve ever memorized anything in my life because I never will do a tape not memorized, like holding the paper. I feel it’s so important to show that you really took time and care about it. But yeah, after that, Jen and Josh Fac-Timed me. Josh was showing me around the stadium because the movie used to have a different ending and they were scouting for the stadium for the ending. And he was like, “This is where we’re going to shoot this. And this is where we shoot this. And this is Jack Fisk, he’s doing the set design.” I’m [thinking], what the f–k is going on? Did I get the part or are you just like, dangling it? And then he told me that I got the part. It was so crazy.\n\nDEADLINE: Did you have the full script? Did you know about the different ending at the time?\n\nI had the script with the original ending before it was changed a couple different times, and then a couple things just had to be cut timing-wise in the movie because otherwise it would’ve been an even longer movie. I feel like they got it to a really good time.\n\nTimothée Chalamet in ‘Marty Supreme’ A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nDEADLINE: Did you do chemistry reads with Timothée before you got the role? Obviously your characters have this intense connection.\n\nNo, no. Nothing. Personally, I feel like Josh, I think he’s got a really good read on actors — a really, really good read. And I think he could just tell if someone will work with someone else beforehand. I think if he has an intuition on someone or something, he’s going to go with it, no matter what. Even if maybe they don’t have chemistry in person or something, I think he can see his vision.\n\nDEADLINE: So, then what was your first interaction with Timothée? Did you just go right into shooting?\n\nJosh thought that it would be a good idea to have us go and have breakfast together somewhere. Or maybe it was dinner. Me, Josh, and Timmy at this little diner in New York. And so, we just hung there for a little bit, and all talked before we started things. I was so excited to start that movie. That movie just is so special for so many reasons. I was kind of feeling at a time where I know I want to do acting with my life… I was just talking to my agent and friend a couple days before I got the tape and I’m like, “Dude, I love working. I love doing these horror movies and I love doing these Indies.” But I’m just like, “I don’t know if I’m going to ever have a career more than this.” And then… This is the first time I’m in something of this scale and this character. I’ve been thinking about that so much. I feel so lucky that I was able to be a part of it. And I feel like Rachel came at such an important time in my life too, just mentally, because I felt like she came when I really needed her. I don’t know, not to get emotional… It was just a hard, hard year, a lot of loss, a lot of people lost and you can’t do anything about that. Once people are gone, they’re gone. So this whole thing felt really, really special and kismet and from the angels, kind of. She’s just such a special character to me.\n\nPenn Jillette, Kevin O’Leary, Timothée Chalamet, Odessa A’zion, Tyler, The Creator, Gwyneth Paltrow and Koto Kawaguchi at the ‘Marty Supreme’ LA Premiere\n\nDEADLINE: What do you think of Rachel? She’s scrappy. She’ll do what it takes to get out of a situation.\n\nShe, in a way, feels like a mixture of inner child and chaos and freedom, while also being really, really strong, secure adult. She’s so confident in what she wants and what she believes she deserves for herself. I wish I had that confidence and to defend yourself and stand up for yourself. And I just think she’s just a really layered, really beautiful strong, character… I just think she’s so stuck in this world. I mean, you look at 1952 and her situation and her husband and being pregnant with the other guy’s baby, but she really wants to be with the other guy, because they’ve loved each other their whole lives. And she’s just so stuck. She’s just restrained by this societal pressure to settle down and get married and do it fast, when she knew that she wanted to be with this other person. And so she takes it into her own hands. She says, “OK, if he doesn’t want to be with me this way, I’m going to show him.” I really, really admire her.\n\nI’m going to go home and watch Hitchcock because I know that those are the movies that were going around at that time. And I’m going to chop my hair off for the role and strip the color out to make her feel younger.\n\nDEADLINE: I interviewed Timmy for A Complete Unknown last year, and one of the things we talked about was how much he immersed himself in this role for Marty Supreme. Tell me about your impressions of working with him, the way he works, and the way your styles fit together as actors.\n\nSo, I think in ways we’re very similar and in ways we’re very different. We’re very similar in ways of we just want it to be as authentic as it possibly can be, which means for me, less rehearsal. Let’s just go in and do it and feel it out and feel what comes. And if there’s something that one of us is stuck on, let’s talk about it. We can easily talk about it. There’s not one of us saying, “I don’t want to talk about it.” It’s fully open, flowy. If one of us feels stuck, we’re there.\n\nBut then [we’re] different in the other sense of he really immerses himself in the character in that way — I don’t really know because I haven’t really talked to him about it, so I cannot speak on his behalf, but from what I’ve witnessed. Versus for me, I immerse myself in the character in just a different way where I’m going to go home and watch Hitchcock because I know that those are the movies that were going around at that time. And I’m going to chop my hair off for the role and strip the color out to make her feel younger. Josh liked my natural color better, and I’m going to make my hair super frizzy so that I’m extra Jewish for the role because that’s what that character was. And I’m going to put the weights on my belly so that I could really feel like I’m pregnant. I’m going to make the playlists so that I have the Rachel playlist of what I think that she was listening to then. And then just a playlist of what I feel about Rachel and Marty’s love. So, I immerse myself in a different way than Timmy immerses himself. I think he needs to be locked into the character in just a different way, but we work with each other really, really well. And I loved working with him and he’s just so incredible. He’s such an amazing actor.\n\nRachel Sennott and Odessa A’zion in ‘I Love LA’ HBO\n\nDEADLINE: Do you feel ready for everyone to see the film when it premieres in a couple days?\n\nI don’t know. I’m a little scared. I’m really, really excited for people to see the movie. I’m really excited for people to see the movie because it’s just such an incredible movie, and these filmmakers, they really have a vision. And I’m so grateful to have been a part in it, in even the tiniest way. It happened really fast. I feel like we just finished filming and boom, now it’s coming out.\n\nDEADLINE: And what are you most excited about making Season 2 of I Love LA?\n\nI’m just excited to go back with all the cast. And the character’s very different for me. We talk different, we walk different. I feel like we look a little different. So that’s always really weird for me, but it’s really fun to do with the cast and to be able to shoot at home because I’m from LA, I live in LA. It’s the best. I’m super excited to go back.\n\nMarty Supreme is in theaters from December 25th.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:46:52 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:39.745461"}

He was 68.\n\nArkadie was born on Dec. 10, 1957. He grew up in Maryland and received his BFA in acting from Southern Methodist University in Dallas before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in entertainment. He secured his first job as a staff writer on the NBC drama series “I’ll Fly Away.”\n\nHe subsequently created “New York Undercover” with Wolf in 1994. The series, which starred Malik Yoba and Michael DeLorenzo as undercover NYPD officers, was the first American cop drama to feature two people of color as the leads. It ran on Fox for four seasons before going off the air in 1999.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDuring and after “New York Undercover,” Arkadie produced “Chicago Hope” on CBS, “NYPD Blue” on ABC and “The Shield” on FX, among other series. He also continued to write, penning episodes of the NBC miniseries “The Temptations” and serving as showrunner on BET’s “Sacrifice” for two seasons.

We remain grateful for his contributions, and he will be deeply missed and always remembered.\n\nLamar also released a statement, calling Arkadie “a consummate professional, true collaborator, and astute researcher” while Arkadie’s cousin and fellow producer L True Green called him “one of America’s greatest storytellers” in a Facebook post.\n\nArkadie is survived by his wife and family.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:21:16 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:21.066953"}

How ‘The Ugly Stepsister’ Make-Up Team Recreated ‘Cinderella’ as a Body Horror", "link": "https://variety.com/2025/artisans/news/ugly-stepsister-body-horror-cinderella-1236616590/", "summary": "Norwegian director Emilie Blichfeldt&#8217;s feature debut &#8220;The Ugly Stepsister&#8221; takes inspiration from an unlikely pair of genres: Disney fairy tales and Italian Giallo films.

The movie, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and was acquired by Shudder, reimagines “Cinderella” as a body horror film from the empathetic perspective of the titular, vilified sibling, Elvira (Lea Myren). As Elvira prepares for the prince’s royal ball, she undergoes body transformations large and small to try conforming to society’s highest beauty standards.\n\n“The most important thing was to make just a normal, cute teenager who is just really in love with this prince,” explains the movie’s makeup designer Anne Cathrine Sauerberg, “and to show what people do to themselves.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nJust the initial effect of making the 24-year-old Myren look like a teenager was a feat for the prosthetic and makeup departments. “She was wearing cheeks and a nose and has a fake neck that actually stops in the middle of the neck,” says prosthetic makeup designer and special effects artist Thomas Foldberg. “We didn’t want her neck to be too broad. We wanted to erase the collarbone and some of the neck muscles. We wanted to make her softer without exaggerating, so it had to be kept really tight and really subtle.”\n\nAt first, Elvira’s transformations are indeed subtle. At the behest of her mother, Rebekka (Ane Dahl Torp), Elvira undergoes a cosmetic nose realignment, executed in the archaic medical practices of the film’s 19th-century setting. The doctor (Adam Lundgren) intentionally fractures Elvira’s nose and she wears a face brace for much of the first act, removing it once to reveal a partially healed, misshapen ridge and later removing it again to reveal a much more conventional nose. Because Foldberg and Sauerberg had Myren in a prosthetic nose from the beginning, they were able to adjust it accordingly to create the subtle change.\n\nThe subtlety decreases as Elvira further modifies her body in anticipation of the ball. Once her nose is in place, Elvira gets an eyelash transplant whereby the same doctor threads fake lashes through her lower eyelid. The camera captures the procedure in an extreme close-up of Elvira’s eye and reverse shots from Elvira’s horrifying perspective.\n\nTo achieve the realistic look of the extreme close-up, Foldberg opted for a blend of practical and digital effects. He collaborated with visual effects supervisor Peter Hjort to composite the actor’s actual eye onto a dummy head. “We did the whole scene with the actress and then we did it with the fake head, which I was actually stitching into, and everything was put together afterwards” Foldberg explains. “It’s basically half a dummy head from the eyelids below and then the other part is the actor herself.”\n\nThe film’s most gruesome scene, however, comes after the ball and is ripped straight from the pages of the original “Cinderella” folk tale. In an effort to fit into the slipper that her stepsister Agnes (Thea Sofie Loch Næss) left at the ball, Elvira severs the toes from her right foot. In a series of sanguinary close-ups, Elvira takes a cleaver to her digits, first slicing them and then fully dismembering them.\n\n“It was extremely complicated to do the slit where the blood is kind of beating out,” explains Foldberg. “That was one big prosthetic foot and then we had two fake legs that went from under her knees and below. We had this blood rigged leg for the initial chopping off of the toes and then it had some small attachments.”\n\nAfter Elvira cuts off her toes and is bleeding out, Rebekka finds her and realizes that she severed the wrong foot for the slipper. Obsessively, Rebekka recreates the wound on Elvira’s left foot, this time captured in a wide shot that shows the foot and leg attached to Elvira’s body. “The real leg was hidden under her dress,” says Foldberg of the shot. “It’s just bent and then the prosthetic leg goes from the knee and down.”\n\nDespite her pathological efforts, Elvira fails to win over the prince and in the final sequence, she crawls about on her broken feet, her hair thinning and teeth chipped from the trauma she’s put herself through.\n\nMuch of that trauma stems from a tapeworm egg that Elvira consumes to lose weight at the beginning of her transformation. By the end, the worm is fully grown, several feet long, and Elvira’s sister, Alma (Flo Fagerli) must help her remove it in a gristly game of tug of war. To achieve the effect of Alma extracting the worm from Elvira’s mouth, Foldberg and his team created several silicone worm pieces and then fed them through a contraption attached to the side of Myren’s face. The contraption was composited out in post-production to make it look like the worm is expelled from the depths of Elvira’s throat. “We also had a puppet head of her from the nose down,” says Foldberg. “Where you could push big chunks of this worm and slime out of her.”\n\nThe film as a whole used minimal CGI and instead went for practical effects paired with compositing, creating a raw and seamless look throughout. This ingenuity paid off, as “The Ugly Stepsister” is now shortlisted for Best Makeup & Hairstyling at the upcoming 98th Academy Awards. It is Shudder’s first shortlisted film in the category.\n\nFor the film’s success, Sauerberg and Foldberg credit Blichfeldt. “She was so well prepared and had so many ideas,” says Foldberg. “I was really, really blown away by her knowledge of genre films and she had really a specific vision for this project.”\n\n“We all know Cinderella’s story so well, so we all have different pictures of how it should look like, and [Blichfeldt’s] vision was just so extremely clear,” adds Sauerberg. “It was so easy to connect with her and her visions and align them with my own visions.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:16:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:21.481439"}

The film, which opens in theaters on Dec. 24 via Independent Film Company, is an unconventional horror tale about a young boy named Ben (Everett Blunck), who is new to the social structure of an all-boys water polo camp. Other children, under the direction of their cruel peer Jake (Kayo Martin) and with very little adult supervision, alienate shy young Eli (Kenny Rasmussen) by saying he has the titular disease. Things get uncomfortable from there.\n\nThe casual viciousness of children is the centerpiece of the film, which has triggered audiences who grew up in the same era as Polinger. After he directed a 2018 short film named “Sauna” with similar themes, he caught COVID and was quarantined in his childhood bedroom. While there, Polinger went through his journals and was reminded of the genesis of the “Plague” game and the memories of people he hadn’t thought about in ages.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I’ve been surprised every step of the way, even just how cross-generational and cross-cultural that sentiment of youth seems to be,” he says. “I had that experience looking at these journals, where it was a sensory portal bringing me back to a time that I had really buried. It was very intense and visceral and overwhelming. I think that the movie has that effect on other people, where it’s like that smell, that candle that brings you back to certain times in life. That takes you on your own journey, and anyone might apply something personal to the movie. People come up to me after screenings and talk to me about their experiences, very personal stories.”\n\nAlthough the film is a period piece set a few decades ago without cellphones, it’s being released at a time when the country is run by President Trump, who frequently uses bullying to set the national tone. Polinger says that although his film is informed by specificity, it can speak broadly to many different cultural touchpoints.\n\n“My feeling about films in general is, when you’re making something that feels as honest as possible and personal, those things usually apply in larger political ways,” he says. “I think there are dynamics of how bullying works, but also how social hierarchies are developed, and myths are made. ‘The Plague’ is kind of a myth. In the beginning, it’s clearly a very dumb game and a dumb joke, and it’s not taken very seriously. But because everyone else chooses to take it seriously, because everyone else is doing it, it starts to become something increasingly real because the collective has made it so.\n\n“Jake, as a ringleader, will look at you like you’re crazy if you don’t take it seriously,” Polinger continues. “You want to fit in with Jake because it’s too scary not to have his approval, because he’s so charismatic, and he’s bonding with everyone else by making fun of the outcast. So you don’t want to be that person. You play the rules of the game, and suddenly they become crystallized. I think that paradigm applies to bigger social structures, political things … in general, authoritarianism. There are cycles of this throughout history that are built around the same human instincts that, hopefully, this film is exploring through a more personal lens.”\n\nAfter “The Plague,” Polinger is set to adapt a high-profile property, helming a feature-length version of Edgar Allan Poe’s short story “The Masque of the Red Death,” starring Oscar winner Mikey Madison. Polinger is excited to start filming his unique vision of the classic text.\n\n“It’s definitely inspired by the short story, but it goes into a completely new story,” he says. “So it’s a very bombastic, irreverent, dark comedic tale, set in this medieval, slightly fantastical world. It’s not a modernized version of it at all. It’s high energy, it’s out there and very different in many ways on the surface from ‘The Plague,’ but also exploring claustrophobic group dynamics — just from a very different genre and tone.”\n\nWatch the trailer for “The Plague” below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.054550"}

Now, less than a month after Season 5 Volume 1 and days ahead of Volume 2, Netflix reports that the entirety of “Stranger Things” has crossed 1.2 billion views in total.\n\nThat statistic, calculated by dividing the total amount of time the series has ever been streamed by the combined runtime of all available episodes, puts “Stranger Things” as a whole above any series in Netflix history — even “Wednesday” and “Squid Game,” which are the only projects with individual seasons that rank above “Stranger Things” Season 4. Released in 2023, Season 4 remains at No. 2 on Netflix’s list of its most popular English-language TV title of all time. Season 3, which is more than six years old now, only recently fell off that chart.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAs such, the most-rewatched scenes in the show’s history came in those seasons: No. 1 is the scene in Season 4 Episode 7 when Nancy (Natalia Dyer) falls into a trance while being possessed by Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), followed by the Season 3 Episode 8 scene when Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Suzie (Gabriella Pizzolo) sing the “NeverEnding Story” theme song together.\n\nIn just 25 days, Volume 1 of Season 5 has reached 102.6 million views. It’s all but guaranteed that Season 5 will make the all-time viewership chart next month; if it was eligible now, before its final episode have been released, it would already rank at No. 9, between “Bridgerton” Season 3 (2024) and “The Night Agent” Season 1 (2023). Plus, Netflix measures its all-time chart ending 91 days after each title’s final episodes are released, meaning Season 5 will continue accruing views until three months after the New Year’s Eve finale. The season has a solid shot to make it to No. 1 during the first quarter of 2026.\n\nIn addition, “Stranger Things” Season 5 has ranked as the most-watched title of the week in 90 of the 93 countries Netflix tracks while also directing viewers back to previous seasons. “Stranger Things” became the first Netflix series to have four seasons in the Top 10 at once, then the first to chart with five seasons — and all five seasons remain on the chart even now, four weeks since Season 5 debuted. And since the advent of the Netflix Top 10 in 2021, the series’ five seasons have made the global Netflix Top 10 a combined 78 times. All 93 countries tracked have seen on “Stranger Things” on their individual Top 10 lists at one point or another.\n\nStill, the reach of “Stranger Things” expands beyond Netflix views.\n\nThe show made headline after headline for its use of “Running Up That Hill” in Season 4. 38 years after the song was released, “Stranger Things” helped earn Kate Bush her first-ever Top 10 hit in the U.S. Additionally, Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” (1986) made the U.K. Top 10 for the first time after being used in the season.\n\nWith Season 5, that effect has been replicated again and again. According to Spotify, several oldies have seen major streaming boosts since their use in Volume 1. Among Gen Z, Diana Ross’ “Upside Down” (1980) saw an increase in streams of 1,250% and Tiffany’s “I Think We’re Alone Now” (1987) jumped by 880%. Across all demographics, streams have risen for The Chordettes’ “Mr. Sandman” (1954) by 625% and for ABBA’s “Fernando” (1976) by 335%, with the latter getting a 645% boost with Gen Z. The music streamer also reports that users have created 205,000 “Stranger Things”-themed playlists since Season 1 debuted in 2016.\n\nEggo, the frozen waffle brand that has existed since 1956, enjoyed renewed interest after being prominently featured in “Stranger Things” as the favorite snack of Millie Bobby Brown’s character, Eleven. Parent company Kellogg’s reported 14% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, which followed the release of Season 2, and 9.4% growth in the first four months of 2018.\n\nNetflix also boasts that interest in “Dungeons & Dragons” has grown by 673% since the 2016 debut of “Stranger Things,” which constantly references the table-top role-playing game — though it must be noted that the “Dungeons & Dragons” universe has made many big strides of its own over the last nine years, including expansions to the game itself, a 2023 feature film and more. Still, its rise — which also includes sales increases of 96% in both 2017 and 2018 — was still heavily impacted by “Stranger Things,” and the show and game have released multiple official collaborations.\n\nThe show also drove a collaboration between Netflix and Nabisco, with the snack company releasing limited-edition “Stranger Things” Chip’s Ahoy cookies ahead of Season 5. The campaign around the cookies reached 11 billion impressions.\n\nNaturally, the series has been a massive boon to the business of content. Since 2016, “Stranger Things” has created more than 8,000 production jobs in the U.S. and contributed $1.4 billion to the national GDP.\n\nThat impact has been strongest in Georgia, where most of the series was filmed, with $650 million contributed to the state GDP and more than 2,000 vendors involved in production. Next in line was California, with $500 million contributed to the state GDP.\n\n“Stranger Things” has also spawned a universe of its own, even before on-screen spinoffs have been released. In the U.S. alone, “Stranger Things” books, comics and other publishing projects have crossed 3.1 million sales since Season 1. “Stranger Things: The Experience,” a live event that was first produced in 2022, has led to 850,000 ticket sales across cities including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, London, Paris, Brazil and Australia. Other live events around the globe, pegged to Season 5 specifically, have attracted more than 300,000 fans across 32 cities and 23 countries, with highlights including the “One Last Ride” cycling event in Los Angeles (50,000 fans) and a parade in São Paulo (13,000). There are still more events to come in London, Bangkok, Milan, Las Vegas and Madrid as 2025 concludes.\n\nAnd in an unprecedented move especially for Netflix, the series finale on New Year’s Eve will be played in movie theaters in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n“Stranger Things: The First Shadow” a play that serves as a prequel to the TV series, debuted in London’s West End in 2023, with a Broadway transfer opening earlier this year. The play won four Tony Awards in the U.S. plus two Olivier Awards and Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards in the U.K. — adding to the 70 awards and 230 nominations the TV series has earned to date, which includes 12 Emmy wins.\n\nAnd when looking at the career trajectories of the young cast of “Stranger Things,” the series can be looked at as a Disney Channel-like talent pipeline, generating celebrities out of tweens who were relatively unknown beforehand. Brown has become Netflix royalty, leading the films “The Electric State” and “Damsel” — the latter being the streamer’s No. 10 most popular English-language movie of all time, plus the “Enola Holmes” franchise, which has a third film premiering in 2026.\n\nSocial media is another good measure of the cast’s rise. Netflix’s earliest tracked Instagram follower count for Brown — which came before “Stranger Things Season 1 debuted but potentially after trailers and marketing had been released — was 2.1 million, and she now has more than 68 million. Sadie Sink, who plays Max, has the next-highest following with 26.8 million, up from 1.1 million before her debut in Season 2. Other following increases include 6,400 to 23 million for Finn Wolfhard; 10,000 to 23.4 million for Noah Schnapp; 18,000 to to 13 million for Caleb McLaughlin; and 20,000 to 17 million for Matarazzo. New Season 5 stars Jake Connelly and Nell Fisher have seen increases from 12,000 to 582,000 and 30,000 to 875,000, respectively.\n\nAlso on social, the pre-launch marketing campaign for “Stranger Things” Season 5 was Netflix’s biggest ever with 5.8 billion impressions. The concurrent rewatch campaign for previous seasons generated 1.3 billion impressions, and “Stranger Things: The Experience” has achieved 2 billion social impressions to date. Even the show’s Easter eggs have gone viral; the subtle inclusion of a “Missing Teen” hotline for Eleven in Season 5 went viral online and resulted in more than 1 million calls.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.324121"}

Netflix has, of course, thrown its weight behind a hefty marketing campaign for Emily in Paris Season 5, which included a press preview aboard a Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train for a 24-hour journey from Venice to Paris. The stunt also offered press interactions with lead cast including Lily Collins and Ashley Park during tea service, Aperitivo Hour, a three-course dinner, and late-night afterparty.

The first four episodes alone have now generated 102.6M views globally to date, just ahead of the Vol. 2 release on Christmas Day. The season came in fourth place on the weekly TV list, but it’s expected to shoot right back up to first place next week thanks to those three new episodes.\n\nAnd, in fact, that already makes it one of Netflix’s most-watched seasons of television ever, soaring right past The Night Agent and Fool Me Once on the English-language most popular list.

So, now the only question is how high it will go.\n\nAll four previous seasons were once again in the Top 10 as well: Season 1 at No. 8 (3.5 million views), Season 2 at No. 10 (3.3 million views), Season 3 at No. 7 (3.6 million views), and Season 4 at No. 6 (3.9 million views)\n\nThe actual biggest title of the week was a Korean disaster film called The Great Flood with 27.9M views, while Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery took No. 1 on the English film list with 20.9M views.\n\nSurprise, surprise, Kpop Demon Hunters came in third with 7.9M views and has now surpassed 500M views since premiere.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:27:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.758364"}

It has made a couple of theatrical runs (including a sing-along version) that has grossed $24.6 million. On the awards front, the pic has Best Animated Film noms from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, and it was voted the year’s best in that category from the New York Film Critics Circle. Its soundtrack snagged five Grammy nominations behind the smash hit “Golden,” which also made the Oscar Original Song shortlist.\n\nA sequel is in the works eyeing a 2029 release.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nKPop Demon Hunters’ narrative centers on their battle against the Saja Boys, a rival boy band whose members are secretly demons serving the villain Gwi-Ma, a flaming, all-consuming mouth inspired by Korean mythology.\n\nThe story, which originated from Kang, is anchored by the internal struggle of the group’s leader, Rumi, voiced by Arden Cho, who harbors the secret that she is half-demon. Trained to believe that all demons are inherently evil, Rumi lives in fear that her bandmates will destroy her if they discover the golden patterns hidden beneath her skin. This personal conflict serves as a central theme, illustrating the battle between one’s public persona and their inner demons — the negative, nagging voices of self-doubt that the filmmakers represent through literal supernatural forces.\n\nBeyond the action, the film explores the nuances of cultural belonging through the character of Zoey, a Korean-American maknae who overcompensates for her fear of not being “Korean enough” as a Korean. Kang, who drew from her own heritage and childhood love of Korean mythology, emphasized that the film is rooted in the tradition of female shaman warriors who used music and dance to connect communities.\n\nUltimately, Kpop Demon Hunters explores how music and human empathy create a literal shield, known as the Golden Honmoon, against the darkness. The filmmakers aimed to show that while inner demons may never fully disappear, individuals can find power in their “true voices” and integrate the fractured parts of their identities rather than hiding them. Employing the blend of K-pop and ancient mythology, the film seeks to tell a universal story about the strength found in vulnerability and communal connection.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:12:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.971480"}

Miller’s wife Cami, played by Demi Moore, has stepped up to run M-Tex Oil, while Andy Garcia’s cartel boss Danny ‘Gallino’ Morrell is getting more involved in the oil business every day.\n\nThen there’s the Norris family; Ali Larter’s Angela is still giving Tommy grief, particularly at dinner, his son Cooper, played by Jacob Lofland, has found his own oil but is also now in business with the cartel, and his daughter Ainsley is getting ready to cheer at Texas Christian University. His father T.L, played by Sam Elliott, is also now in the picture and in the house, and is dealing with his own grief, following the death of his wife and Tommy’s mother.\n\nThe ten-part Paramount+ series, which was created by Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace, and is loosely based on the latter’s Boomtown podcast, runs through January 18. It has been renewed for season three.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nMoore, Elliott, Garcia and Larter sat down with Deadline after a screening of episodes five and six at the Pacific Design Center in LA to discuss the show and their characters.\n\nMoore joked that the first season of the show – where Cami is infrequently shown swimming laps in the pool – was like Where’s Waldo? for her. Season two felt like her first season.\n\n“To Taylor’s credit, this was all very intentional. He’s so smart about really creating the unexpected. No one would ever have thought if you had Jon Hamm that you would be letting him go,” she said. “This was my first chance to really step into the world. I was certainly not the light part of the of the show, dealing, obviously, with tremendous grief. For Cami, I always felt that losing the company would be losing the last piece of Monty that she has, and that it would be an ultimate failure,” Moore said.\n\nDemi Moore as Cami Miller in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nCami is thrown in at the deep end, having to deal with Monty’s financial peculiarities, while keeping the oil rigs pumping. Moore said working with Thornton on those nuances was a lot of fun. “[Tommy] is her lifeline and yet to go against the only anchor that she has – trusting her own instincts – led to a lot of juicy, spicy moments,” she added.\n\nMoore met a number of women that were in a similar situation to Cami. “Taylor and his wife Nicole [Muirbrook] set up a whole gathering with a group of ten women. These women have empowered femininity, they are extremely strong and fierce. It really gave me incredible insight into who he was looking for Cami to be.”\n\nLandman marked The Substance star’s first lead series role. “I had watched almost everything that Taylor had ever done, and I was so impressed with how he wrote his female characters. For a straight white man, that was really even more impressive, because they were so nuanced,” she added.\n\nLandman was Elliott’s second rodeo with Sheridan, having starred in 1883. Elliott had previously called the Yellowstone prequel role a “gift”. “I feel the same way about [Landman]. An opportunity to come and work with this cast and do Taylor’s words again with this crew… it’s just as good as it gets,” he said.\n\nSam Elliott and Billy Bob Thornton in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nThe Tombstone star’s character is dealing with the death of his wife, while figuring out his strained relationship with his son, a relationship that becomes more pronounced when he moves in with the family. Elliott enjoyed the back-and-forth with Thornton. “He’s a one of a kind guy, there’s no doubt about it. He’s a gift to all of us, I know that the company feels that way about him. He’s a lot of fun to work with. He comes ready,” he added.\n\nIt’s not clear how things are progressing between the landman and his corn dog-eating father, particularly after a contentious funeral dinner. “I’m new to the show for one thing, and I don’t really know where I’m headed,” Elliott joked.\n\nBut his character is still enjoying watching the spectacular West Texas sunsets, even if Elliott was staring at lights. “Texas really does have beautiful sunsets. That whole thing about talking about the heat and the lack of moisture in the air and the dust, it’s very true. That’s another thing about Taylor, he knows what he writes about. That’s what makes it fun for me,” he said.\n\nAli Larter as Angela Norris in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nT.L is invited to live with the Norris family by Angela, played by Larter, and he is soon roped into the fun of her themed-dinners, including this season a pirate dinner (which followed an incident with a $2800 mushroom at a previous dinner).\n\nLarter says throwing cacio e pepe at Thornton’s character was “very fun”. “You can just feel the connectivity that has happened this season, and especially with Sam being part of the cast now, and the depth of moments that he brings to the pirate dinner. There’s Ainsley and Angela up to their shenanigans, and then we get to look over and have Sam Elliott just looking at you, and it just brings a different moment to these scenes,” she said.\n\nAngela spends much of season two with Randolph’s Ainsley, helping some senior citizens get drunk and have fun, while they’re meant to be exercising. Angela’s relationship with Tommy is also unfolding.\n\n“It’s incredible coming back for a second season to begin with, because the first season we built our house and you spend a tremendous amount of time figuring out the dynamics of the family, the chemistry that everyone has,” she said. “Once the show is up and running, we’re kind of like a train barreling forward. So, when we came back this year, it was exciting to kind of look at where this relationship was going. It’s just like a complicated, messy relationship, and sometimes we’re laughing and sometimes we’re fighting, and it’s all in there. It’s all very alive, but it’s these two people really questioning if it’s possible for them to make this work, or if this is just kind of a pipe dream.”\n\nAngela also inadvertently gets Tommy to spend more time with Andy Garcia’s character, known only as Gallino when he turns up in the season one finale as a cartel boss saving Tommy.\n\nHe is now Danny Morrell, an investment banker with fingers in a lot of pies. “He has this kind of duality of life, he’s like Bruce Wayne and Batman,” said Garcia.\n\nAndy Garcia and Billy Bob Thornton in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nGarcia, who also compares Gallino to a member of the Corleone family, said that he told Thornton that he believes there’s some trouble ahead for the pair. “He’s going to slip in a spontaneous moment back to that other world. I [told Billy] that his character just happens to be with him when that goes down and he’s gonna hand him a gun and you’re going to have to step in it with me,” he added.\n\n“He’s an investment banker. He’s managing money for a lot of people. He’s managing the syndicate of the horses. He’s got his fingers everywhere. He has to be somebody that is able to navigate that with with a sense of purpose, a sense of class, a sense of people could have to trust him with their money and he has to be successful what he does.

The story, packed to the brim with 15 playable iconic characters, retells the events of the Marvel Comics crossover special of 2006’s Annihilation, which sees the galactic big bad Annihilus wage war amongst the cosmos through a series of mass invasions in hopes of one day ruling it all.\n\nSince its early December launch, Cosmic Invasion has been praised for combining lesser-known Marvel characters and properties with the more popular heroes that have launched a series of IP juggernauts in the MCU and beyond, making the story both casual fan-friendly and surprising for those who worship at the altar of true Marvel fandom. The game has also managed to set itself apart from other side-scrolling brawlers in its Cosmic Swap mechanic, which sees the player choose two characters when they start the game, allowing them to make a swap out any time during a fierce battle against Annihilus’ evil honchos.\n\nBelow, game director Frederic Gemus and Narrative Designer Yannick Belzil speak to Deadline about the inspiration behind the game, character designs and what players can expect next.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDEADLINE: I enjoyed seeing nuanced animations within these level designs of Destromundo, Fort Galactus and Savage Lands. I’m curious, what was the trickiest level design in general?\n\nFREDERIC GEMUS: The trickiest aspect was pretty much trying to figure out where we wanted to go because we’re big fans of the Marvel universe. So, figuring out which environments would be nice to visit and would also help build a story was a challenge. We tried to strike a mix of expected locales for the players and fresh, new places. And obviously, as a game director, one aspect that was important for me was making sure that all of these locations could have interesting gameplay aspects. You mentioned Destromundo, which has Lady Hellbender’s collection of critters from all across the universe. And for us, it was basically a cameo festival of what we can see in the background, but also what kind of surprises can occur from these giant creatures, like how they can interact with the players and reshuffle the battlefield.\n\nIt’s the same thing with Fort Galactus. We wanted to have this idea that we’re climbing toward liberating Galactus, but also, we wanted to have a stage in which we would have multiple encounters with the boss, in this case, the Silver Surfer. So, the whole feeling of fighting against the barricades of enemies with turrets, climbing elevators, and multiple fight sequences, all of these locations we wanted to translate into unique gameplays that would make the experience varied. That way, you get unique experiences so that Fort Galactus feels completely different from Wakanda, which is in the middle of an invasion, and there are a lot of things happening – you ride a train, you fight the claw. We wanted to maximize the gameplay we could get from each stage and then work with Yannick to ensure the adventure remained interesting.\n\nYANNICK BELZIL: When we chose these locales, we wanted to choose environments that felt like classic Marvel Comics locales that people would recognize and could associate with certain characters as well. For example, the first level is classic New York City, which you have in a lot of the Marvel Comics, and there’s a lot of the Daily Bugle stuff tied into Spider-Man. But when you’re in Genosha, you have an X-Men team level where you can fill Sentinels with it. Then you have Wakanda for Black Panther, and you have the Helicarrier for Shield, but that’s also in the lineage of Iron Man and Captain America. Then there’s the Blue Area of the Moon, which is a human settlement and also a classic location for several characters – especially Dark Phoenix.\n\nSo, for me, it was just trying to be like, “Oh, do I recognize that setting from only one screenshot from the comics?” And it was trying to create these really colorful, fun places that our artists would also have fun reinterpreting, and to make sure the player feels like they’re really traveling across the Marvel Universe and having a great big adventure.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: One of the biggest praises for the game is its educational element, which some people find in researching the deep cuts and underused locations and characters that appear. Like Phyla-Vell, Beta Ray Bill, and again, Destromundo. Can you talk a little more about how you chose these?\n\nGEMUS: Selecting 15 playable characters was a challenging thing to do. But at the same time, this still feels like it’s not enough, because we have such a love for these superheroes that we could have done a game with 36 of them and still felt there wasn’t enough. But one thing that was important for us was not necessarily to educate, but to surprise and bring players to some unfamiliar territories in a sense that, as you mentioned, there are some characters we haven’t seen many interpretations of – especially in games – like Nova. So, for us as designers and developers, it was fun to have a chance to help define how these characters could behave in an action game.\n\nBecause if you take Iron Man, for example, people expect Iron Man to be flying and using repulsors. There are abilities and ways to play Iron Man that come with the character, but we really thought it was fun and a great opportunity for us to help further develop how some characters, like Beta Ray Bill, could behave in an action game. Same thing with Phyla-Vell. These are characters we don’t often see, so in a way, we are also introducing them to new fans while helping develop the language across all Marvel games.\n\nDEADLINE: What was the hardest narrative challenge with all these new characters mingling in the game? Especially for those who don’t really have a connection in their own comics.\n\nBELZIL: The game is based on the comic book storyline Annihilation, which came out in 2006. When the Civil War event was happening on Earth in the comics, Annihilation was happening in space. And it’s a really cool story, but it’s more of a Game of Thrones, mature type of story that doesn’t have as many recognizable characters. Even the Guardians of the Galaxy, who became really popular from the movie, came from this comic. So, the big challenge was in figuring out how to make a version of this that is accessible for all ages because we want our games to be played by young kids, but also with their parents or just whole families in general. Fred and I decided that what if the Annihilation storyline was adapted inside the Spider-Man or X-Men cartoon of the ’90s? Then we figured our first six levels or so could be on Earth. You would get to travel a bit across Marvel Earth and encounter recognizable characters, and then they can go off into space together for further adventures and action.\n\nThen, the rest of the game was about how to parse out certain events from the comics, making sure they can happen in a manageable way in beat-’em-up form. At one point, Annihilus uses Galactus to destroy a planet, so the question becomes, how do we make that happen? We have to eventually build a manageable Galactus that can be in a level and do some traps and things like that. But those are more technical challenges for the rest of the staff, whereas I would go, “In level eight, Galactus should be there.”\n\nSome other fun challenges came from writing the dialogue and one-liners. There are one-liners that happen depending on which button the player presses. So, when you have 15 characters, and they say some fighting game type of thing when they execute a move, some characters came really easily, some were trickier, but the biggest thing is you don’t want them to repeat each other’s lines too much. That’s where the rubber really met the road for me, writing-wise, because there’s only so many things you can say to express something without repetition. This was especially true when it came to [the game mechanic of] swapping characters when they have to go, “Oh, up to you, so-and-so.” It was like, “Oh man, I have to find different versions of these characters calling each other.” And some of these characters don’t have relationships. Like, I don’t know if Storm has ever shared space with Cosmic Ghost Rider, so how do they feel about each other? I have to figure things like that out and give them unique one-liners.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: Fans are also responding positively to that character swap mechanic that you mentioned. Why do you think that is? And why was it important for you to build it into the game?\n\nGEMUS: [The idea started] with having 15 playable characters, and we wanted to make sure that they didn’t play the same. We wanted to make sure that Spider-Man does Spider-Man stuff. At the same time, Wolverine does all of the raging crazy things that Wolverine does, but that also means that we didn’t want it to give all abilities to everyone because if you look at classic beat-‘em-ups, for example, grabs and throws are going to be built most of the time within every character themselves. Still, we wanted to make sure to really focus on the differences and strengths of all the superheroes; it would be better to focus on the play style of each character through the lineup. That also meant that we got a bit worried at one point that maybe it would be overwhelming for the players to actually be able to pick someone because maybe they’d be like, “Oh, I’m going to pick Storm, but what if there is a moment where I wish I had She-Hulk with me or I’m going to play Iron Man, but maybe Wolverine would be better suited for that sequence.” So, we thought that by combining two characters together, you would be able to basically build one and have the advantages of both.\n\nThen, we thought about how to interact. At first, our system was a bit more complex, where you had to request that the other characters come in and perform specific actions. Then we realized that, since our target audience is so large, we wanted to make it a more accessible game, so we created a simple button system that lets the game infer the context of what you’re in and pick the right action. This was the funnest version of that complex system. For example, if an enemy grabs your hero and you’re stuck there, swapping means your second character will come in and free you with an attack. We thought that this was quite cool and lived up to the Marvel fantasy, because when you look at Marvel Comics, it’s always heroes teaming up. So, that system was so important to us because we wanted the player to feel like they are in a team of superheroes against Annihilus, who is basically alone and wants to remain alone in the end and destroy the whole universe so that he can just be the last one standing.\n\nBELZIL: I think the reason why people respond is just the mere sensation of being able to play with two action figures at once, which is really useful and fun in a primal way. Like, you get your two favorite heroes, and you can use them over and over and automate moves by having them chime in. There’s something about the fun of this time-honored Marvel Comics tradition to have characters meet up for the first time and then have them team up to go against a larger villain.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: I’d be remiss not to bring up the fan conversation around Silver Surfer’s butt. What say you? Apparently, the gamers are saying it is very round, fit and caked up.\n\nBELZIL: He is. I feel like he has an accurately depicted toned surfer physique. In fact, I think we might have been asked to tone down some of the pronunciation of his butt cheeks, but they still survived in the screen images, not in the gameplay [sequences]. So, the butt remains prominent and important, where you can see it. Silver Surfer worked hard for that butt, and we’re glad people can enjoy it.\n\nDEADLINE: What can players expect from the future? Any further additions to the game to look out for?\n\nGEMUS: Right now, we are on the other side of launch, meaning that we’re still looking at players’ reception. We’re also fixing bugs and trying to identify what needs improvement. It’s easy when you ship a game and have a team of 20 testers, vs launching the game and now there are 100,000s of people playing it. So, there are definitely some surprises that we are working hard on, but for now, this is pretty much our focus. We are looking at, do players love the game? Do they want more? Do they have hopes for extra content? We are listening, but we don’t have anything to announce at the moment.\n\n\n\nBELZIL: Look, we’ve seen every comment section become a suggestion box for future characters. And like they say on Pandora, “We see you.” But also, between when the game was actually done and when it came out, it’s not that long a stretch. So, it’s not like we have secret DLC in our back pocket that we’re waiting to spring on people. It’s exciting that people really want more, and they want their favorite characters as well. It’s fun to see the enthusiasm for the game and that they want more. So, we hope to deliver on that someday, but for now we’re just sitting back and enjoying it.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:11:23 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T21:25:06.258783"}

Friday-Sunday are free and clear of holidays and are pure moviegoing days. The worst for distributors is when Christmas Eve, a slow day, and Christmas Day fall on the Friday-Sunday span. That’s a wrench to turnstiles.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n20th Century Studios’ Avatar: Fire and Ash will continue to conquer with an estimated $75M 4-day take; $55M second 3-day weekend, -38%, from its $89.1M opening. Yesterday, the James Cameron directed, and Cameron, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Josh Friedman & Shane Salerno story by threequel crossed $398.7M worldwide. Monday domestic was $13.3M at 3,800 locations, -18% from Avatar: Way of Water‘s first Monday of $16.2M. Fire and Ash‘s total U.S./Canada running cume is $102.5M. That running cume for Fire and Ash is about $10M less than the combined first 4-day domestic totals of Mufasa and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 a year ago (which totaled $112.5M). Audience score for the Cameron Na’vi movie on Rotten Tomatoes remains at 91%.\n\nSony looks to be reviving comedy as its meta take of 1997’s Anaconda is looking at second place with $20M+ at 3,400 locations. There are previews starting tomorrow at 12noon for the Jack Black-Paul Rudd movie with Thursday showtimes at 2,900 locations starting as early as 9AM. So far, 39 critics don’t like it on Rotten Tomatoes at 39%. However, Anaconda is the only place for laughs this Christmas. First choice and unaided awareness for the $45M net production is best with guys under 25.\n\nUniversal Pictures International / Everett Collection\n\nThird, fourth, fifth and sixth will be a toss between Focus Features’ new Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson Neil Diamond tribute movie, Song Sung Blue, A24’s wide expansion of Josh Safdie’s Marty Supreme (already at $1M+ in six NYC and LA locations), and the second weekends of Angel Studio’s David and Lionsgate’s The Housemaid. All are eyeing $12M-mid-teens apiece over four days. Marty Supreme and Housemaid could overindex.\n\nSong Sung Blue from filmmaker Craig Brewer and produced by Brewer, John David and John Fox, will open in 2,400 locations on Christmas with previews starting at 2PM on Christmas Eve. Jackman and Hudson play real-life Wisconsin couple Mike and Claire Sardina who fell in love via their music impersonators’ acts. Their tale — a roller coaster. You gotta see the movie to find out what happens. Critics are 73% certified fresh. Hudson is up for Best Female in a Feature Comedy/Musical at the Golden Globes. Best unaided awareness is with men and women over 25, on par with last year’s A Complete Unknown and slightly higher than Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.\n\nThe Timothée Chalamet period dramedy Marty Supreme stands at 95% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and is best with men over 25 in first choice and unaided awareness. Previews start tomorrow around 12 noon. Anticipation is building especially in the wake of Chalamet’s recent viral stunt of standing atop The Sphere in Las Vegas and the Empire State Building which clocked 1.3M views on Instagram (I hear he truly braved this like a pro — he’s not a fan of heights). Social media reach for the Chalamet movie is 197M across TikTok, Instagram, X, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which isn’t far from Saltburn‘s 214M reach.\n\nChalamet’s Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown got a pure 5-day launch last Christmas, Wednesday-Sunday, grossing $23.2M; pic’s 3-day was $11.6M. It was great counterprogramming over the holiday ending its run at $75M.\n\nRelishMix says that pre-wide release social media stats on Marty Supreme are running 47% above high concept drama genre norms boosted by Chalamet’s 21.5M fans, Tyler the Creator’s 39M, Gwyneth Paltrow’s 15.2M followers, Kevin O’Leary’s 6.5M, Fran Drescher at 2.8M and Odessa A’Zion at 2M.\n\nSays RelishMix, “Convo runs positive for Marty Supreme when you cut through the static and lock onto the core fandom, who are here for Timmy, Tyler and Safdie magic. Devotion fires fast with lines like ‘I’m so excited about this film, I would watch anything with Timmy in it’ and ‘Clicked for Tim, stayed for Tyler, I’ll go to theaters since Tyler is in it.’ Table-tennis lifers show up strong, saying ‘As a table tennis lover, can’t wait to see Marty Supreme hit the big screen’ and ‘As someone whose main sport has been table tennis since I was a little kid, I have to watch this movie.’ Awards chatter peaks early with ‘I smell Oscars’ and ‘Oscars incoming, lighten up people.’ Fans brand the package prestige, from ‘A24 + Chalamet + Safdie = excellent’ to ‘Omg this looks brilliant.’ Even comps land flattering, with ‘Totally getting Forrest Gump vibes here and I’m in’ and ‘It’s Bob Dylan playing ping pong.'”\n\nYesterday, Zootopia 2 was No. 2 at the Monday B.O. with $4.3M at 3,540 and a running total of $287.4M. Remember, we told you that there were 81% K-12 out and 91% colleges on break.\n\nLionsgate’s Housemaid was $3.4M at 3,015 sites, -35% from Sunday, in third with a running four-day of $22.4M.\n\nAngel Studio’s David at 3,118 made $3.3M, -42% from Sunday, for a running cume of $25.2M.\n\nParamount’s SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants at 3,557 sites is up to $18.4M after four days with Monday taking in $2.8M, -34% from Sunday.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:00:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T21:25:06.560109"}

It also played in Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight section.\n\nA24 landed the indie dramatic comedy in Park City and released it in theaters in late June. It has since landed a Critics Choice nomination for the original screenplay, while Victor, maybe best known for their role in Showtime’s Billions, picked up a Best Actress – Drama nom from the Golden Globes. They are also up for Best Picture, Best Screenplay and Best Director at the Indie Spirits.\n\nIn the pic, which Victor wrote during the Covid lockdown in a Maine cabin, centers on Agnes, who we meet living in a quaint but somewhat isolated home near a New England college — they same place where she and her college roommate Lydie (Naomi Ackie, a Spirits nominee for Supporting Performer) lived when they were students. It seems Lydie and everyone else from that time has moved on, while Agnes has stayed put, on the verge of landing a big professor job in her old English department. It’s slowly revealed the reason Agnes seems stuck to everyone else: it’s the “bad thing,” being sexually assaulted by her thesis mentor (Louis Cancelmi), during her last year of school.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n(The act itself is never shown; rather, Agnes emerges from the event with what happened now simply a part of her. It’s a stunningly effective device.)\n\nThe film’s story is shown in several non-linear segments, and uses plenty of gallows humor to bring the reader into Agnes’ mind-set, skipping back and forth from before, during and after the moment she can’t forget and can’t get past, living with her like a specter (the college job she takes replaces her attacker, who fled after the incident; she even takes over his office). It takes Agnes’ ride-or-die buddy Lydie (now living in New York and having a baby) and a caring, somewhat smitten neighbor (Lucas Hedges) to help her maybe find a way through.\n\n“I found myself writing the film I felt I needed when I found myself in a similar crisis to Agnes,” Victor says about the script, which they say didn’t substantially change beyond the first draft. “I didn’t want to write about violence or assault specifically as much as I wanted to explore how a person heals. What interested me most was digging into that feeling of being stuck, seeing people you love moving on, while you’re still caught thick in the bad thing that happened to you. I started out writing this for the person I used to be.”\n\nThe film was produced in part by Barry Jenkins, Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak’s Pastel, which took Victor under its wing and and encouraged them to not only write and star but direct.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:04:20 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T22:25:39.108986"}

However, for one Diddy accuser there is nothing fun, funny or insightful about the comedian’s comments.\n\n“His latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs,” Jonathan Hay told Deadline.\n\n“Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once ‘missed his chance’ to have sex with her,” the producer added of the part of the December 19 dropped Unstoppable where the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor winner discussed allegations against Combs and his so-called “freak-offs” with the Me & U singer.” Such humor doesn’t just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it,” Hay adds.\n\nREAD ALL OF JONATHAN HAY’S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS BELOW\n\nLast month, the LA County Sheriff’s Department announced it has opened an investigation into claims of a 2020 sexual battery by Combs against music producer Hay. There was also a 2021 incident where Diddy said a kidnapped and hooded Hay was being a “snitch,” and allegedly ordered everyone else out of the room and then tried “to force plaintiff to perform oral copulation on Combs, while plaintiff’s head was still covered.”\n\nDiddy’s team responded to at the time to the claims in redacted filings by Hay by saying their client “categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone.”\n\nIf Combs is charged out of the LASD probe and found guilty, he could be sentenced to several years in California state prison. Right now, serving a four-year sentence in a low-security facility in New Jersey for being found guilty on July 2 of two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution in his sex trafficking and RICO trial, an appealing Combs isn’t expected to be free until mid-2028.\n\nToday, as the LASD probe continues according to law enforcement sources, Hay was vehement in his claims and criticism of “my favorite comedian of all time” Chappelle’s POV on Combs and his alleged actions of sexual violence and exploitation.\n\n“As someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren’t abstract punchlines, they’re relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me.”\n\nNow, it’s no secret that Chappelle likes to punch out for outrage’s sake. In the suddenly released Unstoppable, the comedian tells a riotous DC crowd in the tight 75-minute special of why he decided to perform at a comedy fest in Saudi Arabia despite the Kingdom’s 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, plus his take on reactions to Charlie Kirk’s death and trans rights (again).\n\nChappelle also admits a bias for Combs based on the Bad Boy Records founder leaping to his physical defense when an attacker stormed the stage while the comic was performing at the Hollywood Bowl in 2022. “It’s not that I think Puff is right, but when I got attacked in L.A. at the Hollywood Bowl, people forget Puff was the guy that tackled my attacker,” Chappelle tells the Unstoppable crowd. “He saved my life.”\n\n“That’s a hard dude to be mad at after that.”\n\nStill, it’s not all high fives as Chappelle details a visit to Diddy’s LA home not long afterwards that went sideways towards the end – though the comic didn’t realize it at the time.\n\n“I didn’t see none of the stuff they said in that trial,” Chappelle starts off. “House is clean, traction on the floor, nothing slippery,” he notes in a clear reference to the prodigious baby oil use that Combs was tainted with in testimony over his alleged sexual abuse of Ventura and other women with male escorts.\n\n“Puff started swirling his drink like this and he goes, ‘So Dave, what are you into?’” Chappelle then said after a bit of a chat between the duo. continues. “You know me, I was like, ‘I don’t know …books, video games.’ I didn’t know that was my big chance to f*ck Cassie.”\n\nLater, Chappelle swings it all around, sorta.\n\n“Cassie is a gangster,” he states of Combs’ ex, who spent days and days on the stand in a NYC federal courtroom earlier this year telling a jury of the years of drugs, violence, rape, multi-million dollar settlements and more from Diddy – testimony that was often backed up by videos and photos. “She did something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. She had to testify about her sex life. That’s tough.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chappelle did not respond to Deadline’s request for comment on Hay’s statement. Netflix did respond, but had no comment.\n\nAs of today, Chappelle’s self-proclaimed “no-holds-barred special” The Unstoppable is the Number #1 TV show on the streamer. That top spot is the same number #1 that the Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson produced Sean Combs; The Reckoning held just a few weeks ago\n\nREAD JONATHAN HAY’S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS HERE:\n\nDave Chappelle has long been my favorite comedian of all time, a master of sharp wit and unflinching social commentary. Yet his latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs. Throughout the show, Chappelle frames Combs’ recent Mann Act conviction as an example of racially motivated persecution, drawing parallels to the legendary boxer Jack Johnson, the very figure around whom the law was originally crafted to criminalize his relationship with a white woman across state lines.\n\nThe issue here is glaring: Combs was charged under the Mann Act for sex trafficking women of color, not for the interracial dynamics that fueled Johnson’s targeting. This mischaracterization overlooks the gravity of the allegations against Combs, which center on the exploitation and trafficking of women of color. Even more troubling, Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once “missed his chance” to have sex with her. Such humor doesn’t just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it.\n\nAs someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren’t abstract punchlines, they’re relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me. The pain never fully fades, and hearing a global icon like Chappelle defend an assailant while millions laugh along only amplifies the isolation. Imagine if Chappelle himself, or his sons Sulayman and Ibrahim, were victims of violent sexual assault. How would he feel watching a comedian publicly champion their abuser, turning their suffering into worldwide entertainment? It’s not comedy; it’s callous. We deserve better from the artists we admire.\n\nAs a survivor still carrying the weight of what happened, moments like these in Chappelle’s special only deepen my resolve and make me all the more eager for the ongoing criminal investigations by both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department into the allegations against Sean Combs, CJ Wallace, and Willie Mack to deliver the accountability I deserve.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:18:10 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T02:10:55.545803"}

The announcement was wince-inducing for National Geographic, which saw its prime contender go unrecognized, even though the film in question had just won the IDA Award for Best Feature Documentary. Likewise, HBO Documentary Films came up short with one of its top hopefuls – a documentary directed by a famed actress. HBO, however, was rewarded with recognition for The Alabama Solution, the investigative documentary directed by Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman.\n\nEye-opening for Oscar doc watchers — the quantity of films lacking U.S. distribution that overcame that barrier to earn a place on the feature shortlist, among them Holding Liat, Seeds, Yanuni and Coexistence, My Ass! Ridley, an Oscar winner himself (12 Years a Slave) and a member of the Academy, praises the doc branch for embracing Seeds, but he expresses outrage over the omission of a film directed by Davis Guggenheim and Nyle DiMarco.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“Really? Really?” Ridley says with incredulity regarding that snub.\n\nOne film had to cut through rocks to get onto the shortlist. Also in the mix — a documentary from a filmmaker who won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature just two years ago, and another by a filmmaker who earned her Academy Award a decade ago.\n\nWe also put the short documentaries shortlist under the microscope. Some prominent filmmakers were recognized there including Joshua Seftel, Ondi Timoner and Jay Rosenblatt. The remarkable Geeta Gandbhir made the shortlist for an acclaimed feature she directed and for short documentary she co-directed, an impressive two-fer.\n\nThat’s on the new episode of Doc Talk, hosted by Ridley and Carey, Deadline’s senior documentary editor.

She is one of 13 survivors of the global shift known as The Joining, which has fused almost all of humanity into a single shared consciousness with whom she’s eager to merge. A special gas has been delivered via plane, and she happily inhales it, briefly convulsing in a state of hive-mind bliss. She’s one of the Others now, and they all evacuate the village expeditiously. One down, 12 to go.\n\nIn the episode, titled “La Chica o El Mundo” (“The Girl or the World”), a bloodied Manousos (Carlos Manuel Vesga) completes his death-defying journey from Paraguay to New Mexico. And Carol (Rhea Seehorn) is playing house with Zosia (Karolina Wydra). With the rest of the unaffected living in delusion and shooting the shit on weekly Zoom meetings, Manousos may be Carol’s last hope at (in his view) saving humanity. But while he’s been trekking through the Darién Gap and teaching himself English, Carol’s been playing croquet and sleeping with the enemy.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe two “Old-Schoolers,” as the cast and crew of “Pluribus” refer to them, don’t exactly get along. Manousos dumps Carol’s phone through a drain grate, and they bicker about whether the Others are, in fact, people. Carol’s situationship with Zosia has softened her views on the 7 billion people stricken with the mind virus, so much so that she threatens Manousos with a shotgun as he attempts to cure one of them with radio frequencies.\n\nEventually, Carol chooses the titular girl over the world, and she and Zosia embark on globe-trotting adventures, including a luxurious ski trip. The honeymoon phase comes to a screeching halt, however, when Zosia lets it slip that the Others have found a way to potentially convert Carol into one of them, against her will. It was previously established that they would need her stem cells, but their biological imperative prevents them from retrieving them via injection without her consent. Now, Zosia admits, the Others have discovered eggs that Carol had frozen with her late wife, Helen. Through a tricky, months-long process, they hope to convert the eggs into stem cells, which they could use to share their happiness with Carol.\n\nThis betrayal makes Carol go nuclear — literally. Remember when the Others told her they’d give her an atom bomb if she asked for one? Well, now they have. Back in Albuquerque, she and Manousos make a pact to save the world by any means necessary.\n\nIn two interviews, Seehorn and “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan, director-writer-EP Gordon Smith and writer-EP Alison Tatlock break down those finale twists and reveal their original, less explosive Season 1 ending.\n\nA major revelation in this episode is that the Others have Carol’s frozen eggs, which they can turn into stem cells, which they can use to convert her into one of them. Previously, they said they would need her consent — what changed?\n\nGILLIGAN: Well, literally, the Others are very lawyerly. The specific question that was put to them — which they answered via signboard on that hotel casino in Las Vegas — was, “Is it true you need our stem cells?” And the answer was yes. Then Carol asked, “Is it further true that to collect those stem cells, you would need to stick a needle in my hip?” They were very cautious about how it was phrased. It’s like in Episode 2, when one of the characters says, “So, you are vegetarians?” There’s a little pause, and then Zosia says, “We would prefer to be vegetarians, yes.” It’s very “Perry Mason”–esque, very lawyerly in how they answer questions. But nothing literally changed.\n\nSMITH: We talked about the possibility that maybe they learned something new about Carol’s eggs. They said at the very beginning, “We’re trying to figure out how to turn you.” And then they learned how to turn her. They can learn things.\n\nTATLOCK: They don’t need consent to change people, of course, because the premise of the show — right from the pilot — is that they change everybody as quickly as possible, first by kissing and eventually by planes flying overhead. If they could put their special spice in the water, they absolutely would. What they do need is consent to intrude upon somebody’s physical being. So they couldn’t take her stem cells directly. But if her stem cells already exist — or if the eggs, which aren’t stem cells, can be converted through a tricky process into stem cells — and they’re already outside of her body, they’ll do it.\n\nSo, it’s still the case that they cannot lie, but they can withhold information?\n\nGILLIGAN: They can mislead you all the live-long day. Absolutely. We were talking about “Perry Mason” — the Raymond Burr version from the ’50s. The famous moment in that show is when someone says, “What if I told you the killer was on the street at 3?” And later in the episode someone says, “You told me the killer was on the street at 3,” and Raymond Burr says, “No, I said, what if I told you.” That’s the key to it. For us, with these folks, they’re very lawyerly.\n\nSMITH: They can lie by omission.\n\nLet’s talk about Zosia’s betrayal of Carol.\n\nSEEHORN: I don’t think the betrayal could have been larger. Carol was living in a willing delusion. But there was always a part of her still in there. So, by the time Zosia says, “We stole your eggs,” it’s like: the eggs that represent the future that I wanted with my wife, who is now dead, partially because of you? And I also told you implicitly that I don’t want this, and you’re doing it behind my back? It’s also that horrible feeling of feeling like a fool for letting your guard down for a second. For Carol, it’s magnified: How did I dare think I could have love and joy? On top of that, this massive clock is now ticking about how long Carol has before they’re going to turn her.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nWhat is Zosia’s motive for kissing Carol in Episode 8?\n\nTATLOCK: I think the motive behind the kiss, from the Others’ point of view, is to offer Carol something that would bring her comfort and pleasure and help her forget her troubles for a little while. I think it’s an act of love in their mind. Now, watching it, you could say it’s an act of manipulation, or maybe even worse. But from their point of view, they feel like they’re giving her something she longed for but wasn’t able to fully take for herself, and that it would help her get through a hard, transitional chapter in her life — the chapter before being changed into one of them.\n\nTo what extent is Carol enamored by Zosia?\n\nSEEHORN: Enamored is a great way to put it. I think she is sincerely enamored by her. The kiss is something Carol didn’t even know how much she needed. Even when she runs down the driveway to hug her [in Episode 6], I think Carol is profoundly shaken and surprised by how much she — who used to be such a misanthrope and crave being alone all the time — could be pushed to the limits of realizing, I do need people. I need companionship. Voluntary isolation is a much different thing than involuntary isolation. She’s in an extraordinarily vulnerable and fragile place in that scene.\n\nAs to whether the Others are “manipulating” Carol, I suppose every action can be justified by, “We just want to make you happy, Carol.” But at what point does making Carol happy mean the same thing as, “We’re going to give you everything you want so that we see eye to eye on things?” It’s not lost on me that Episode 8 is titled “Charm Offensive”!\n\nGILLIGAN: You’re definitely asking the right questions. What it boils down to is two people trying desperately to change each other. It’s a very dramatic set of circumstances, and I think about how this plays out in relationships all the time — people who love someone but also want to change them. You hear about that all the time: “We’re going to get married, and I’m going to change them.”\n\nSEEHORN: How do we separate altruism and manipulation? Most acts of kindness and love do have a payoff, even if it’s just feeling good about yourself. Even unconditional love might be a child you have a responsibility to raise, or a fear of being alone, or a desire to receive love back. I honestly don’t know the answer, and I haven’t asked Vince to definitively tell me. I know he’s thrilled that it’s open to interpretation — whether the Others are being manipulative, whether they’re being sincere, and whether those two things can coexist.\n\nWhy does Carol threaten Manousos to stop experimenting on the Other? She’s come a long way from how she felt at the beginning of the series.\n\nSEEHORN: From the very beginning, as angry as Carol was — screaming at them, “You murdered my wife, I want nothing to do with you!” — she always felt horrible about physically harming any of them. She always showed extreme guilt, even to the degree that she was willing to suppress her rage in order not to harm them. She even asks them at one point, when she’s in Spain, “Can you give me anything to make me stop doing this?” And that’s early on, when she still hates them.\n\nNow, she has feelings for Zosia that are individualized, which illustrates to Carol that these are humans with a neurological shift, and they should not be harmed. So when she sees Manousos screaming at that guy shaking on the couch, she knows that not only could it cause Zosia to go into cardiac arrest, it could also mean killing millions of people all over the world again. And it infuriates her that he can’t see any other way. At the same time, the audience knows she’s being extraordinarily defensive, because this guy can see through her. He knows she’s lying about why they came back and why she cares [about them] more now.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nIt seems like a lot of her conversation with Manousos is informed by the last couple days she spent with Zosia. I’m not sure she would have said the Others are “not evil” even a couple episodes ago.\n\nSEEHORN: Fair point. The romantic part of it and feeling like she actually has a companion has muddied that. Some people have asked me if the Others leaving Carol in that extreme state of isolation was a manipulative tool to make her need them. I don’t know the answer to that, and I hadn’t even thought about it. I thought they were trying to protect themselves. But whatever the result is, Carol would absolutely see them coming back as an act of compassion. Many things have happened that make her feel like these people deserve compassion. They helped me. They put my Sprouts back. They made sure I was taken care of. Even when they couldn’t stand me, they brought me anything I wanted. And when I needed companionship, they gave it to me.\n\nWe see the Other drive away, seemingly unfazed by Manousos’ experiment. Just for the record: It did not work, correct? There is no way he has been converted back?\n\nGILLIGAN: I never even thought of that.\n\nSMITH: He’s not converted back. If he were converted back, Zosia would be doing something else. I don’t think she would be walking out to leave Albuquerque. There would be a four-alarm fire on their hands.\n\nTATLOCK: He would be very disoriented. He just looks placid and pleasant.\n\nGILLIGAN: Rick! That’s his name. Rick just gets in his Prius and leaves.\n\nSurveillance is something Carol and Manousos bicker about. Manousos is more afraid than Carol about being spied on via digital devices. To what extent is that reasonable, or is he just paranoid?\n\nTATLOCK: We know there are drones. We’ve seen the drones come in and out to deliver things. We know in the beginning Carol says, “Are you spying on me?” So, Manousos is not entirely wrong to suspect that they’re being watched. There are many reasons to believe someone is keeping an eye on them.\n\nGILLIGAN: They basically have admitted that.\n\nWhy does Manousos start speaking to Zosia after months of staunchly resisting the Others? I mean, he decides to cross the Darién Gap so that he doesn’t have to interact with them.\n\nGILLIGAN: I think it’s his interaction with Carol. Carol says to him, “Have you tried just talking to them?,” which is rich coming from her, because in Episode 2 the character Laxmi says to Carol, “Have you not asked these people questions? Why have you not asked them what it’s like?” And now the shoe is on the other foot. Seven episodes later, Carol is saying, “Why don’t you just talk to these people?” And I think he takes her at her word. He tries it. And because he might be starting to feel like, I don’t know if I’m going to get straight answers from this woman whom I came 6,000 kilometers to talk to.\n\nTATLOCK: Yeah, he becomes suspicious of Carol, so he decides to try a different tack, which is to get information about Carol from Zosia.\n\nYou have Chekhov’s gun in this season. You also have Chekhov’s atom bomb. When was it apparent that the nuke was going to be a major crux of this season?\n\nGILLIGAN: Surprisingly late.\n\nSMITH: A day or two into shooting the episode was when that became clear.\n\nTATLOCK: It was not the ending we broke together in the writers’ room. We adjusted it later, which is a bit unusual.\n\nGILLIGAN: We had an ending that was perfectly good. It would have been satisfying but not as satisfying. And we got a note. You know the old thing about how executives always have stupid notes. Actually, Apple and Sony said, “Is there an even better ending to be had?” And we listened, and I’m really glad they gave us that note. It made for a better ending.\n\nTATLOCK: We had planted the seed in Episode 3 but we didn’t have an exact plan to pay it off in this way. It opened an opportunity to do that.\n\nCan you share the ending you originally had planned?\n\nSMITH: It was similar to that ending. It was more subtle. Carol secretly forges a pact with Manousos, slips him a note and is perhaps going to play double agent. There wasn’t as much of a flag planted, like: “Nope, I’m not doing this. This relationship with the Others can’t continue.”\n\nGILLIGAN: Other than the atom bomb not being part of it, it was not open warfare. It was, I’m going to continue to be a double agent. It was covert. Even before we got the note, we thought, Is this the most satisfying way to go? Do we buy this?\n\nWhy do they give her the atom bomb? I know it’s established early on, but if they’ll go against her wishes with the stem cells, why won’t they go against her wishes with the nuke?\n\nGILLIGAN: Good question. They contain multitudes. It’s this constant tension between wanting to make her happy [and protecting themselves]. As horribly destructive as one atom bomb is… obviously, they don’t want her to set it off. But if she did — no pun intended — one atom bomb would not be the end of the world.\n\nTATLOCK: There are 7 billion of them populating the entire Earth, so they are trying to placate her as best as they can, and they know they have the upper hand.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nWhat would Earth look like if the Others converted everybody? In the opening scene of the finale, they immediately leave the village after converting Kusimayu, because they have no reason to be there. And those bodies have no reason to even be with each other anymore — that family has no purpose. In other words, who are the Others without the Old-Schoolers?\n\nSMITH: In Episode 8, we hear about the dish they’re building, so we know they have some sense of purpose. We’re not 100% clear on what that looks like, or what the boundaries around that are, but we do think that it might be a nice world.\n\nTATLOCK: It’s a peaceful world. They’re a collective, and they are entirely pragmatic, so there’s no need anymore for them to recreate culture or to play pretend. If there’s no more Old-Schoolers left, they don’t need to do what they’re doing for Mr. Diabaté [Samba Schutte] or for Kusimayu. So, they are living as efficiently as possible and at peace with each other and with the Earth, but with no attachment.\n\nGILLIGAN: The perfect reaction to the show is for the viewer to decide for themself: Is this paradise or is this hell? You could watch, for instance, the way the Others walk away from that Peruvian village and say, “Oh my God, this is a nightmare. Suddenly everybody is cold to one another.” But if you look really closely, they’re not actually cold to each other. They’re just there. It’s like all the cells in my body — I’m not paying attention to each one, but they make up one whole organism. They are happy, I think. But then again, is that paradise, or is it hell?\n\nWhy is it important that Carol is not necessarily always “likable” — or the perfect hero?\n\nSEEHORN: She is a reluctant hero, to say the least. She definitely was not hoping to lead the revolution, but she feels like nobody else will. Her behavior is flawed because she is an everyman who is faced with an insane circumstance. She is not heightened. She is in a fantastical world, but she herself is utterly realistic, emotionally. What would you do if you found yourself feeling like you were in a dystopian, apocalyptic nightmare? I’d rather watch somebody misbehave in that moment, as long as it’s truthful. Her vulnerability when she finds out that the other English speakers are all hanging out without her on weekly Zooms — that’s so human. We’ve all been there. I have been excluded from certain lunch tables in the cafeteria. That hurts, even when the big picture is much bigger.\n\nI also find her suppression of rage very interesting to explore. I know she’s impulsive. I know she shouldn’t be screaming or saying some of the things she says. But I also know that in my real life, many women I know should not be suppressing their anger and rage as much as they are. They should not be lowering their voices or trying so hard to be palatable. Those are flaws, too.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T08:36:53.427815"}

She also launched an interview podcast, In the Makeup Chair, which features conversions with guests about beauty, business and behind-the-scenes life.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHer new agency, NAO Talent, was quietly set up in September 2025 by creator-manager duo Amelia Olivia and Niamh Plunkett. They formed the business out of Olivia’s own creator career, after identifying a gap in the market for a management company that approaches careers and dealmaking from both a creator and commercial perspective.\n\nOlivia is a well-established content creator who also began her career in the beauty industry. She has grown a community of more than 1.5 million subscribers across platforms.\n\n“NAO Talent really was born out of our own lived experience,” Olivia told Deadline. “As my career as a creator grew, my manager Niamh and I realised that creators are effectively building full-scale businesses, but most structures were still treating them like short-term marketing channels.\n\n“We’d gone from small gifting deals to global partnerships and billboards and it became clear that what moved the needle wasn’t luck, it was strategy, alignment and having someone in your corner who genuinely understands the creative and commercial sides of this industry. We launched NAO Talent together because there was a real gap for creator-first management that helps talent build sustainable, fulfilling careers – not just chase the next campaign.”\n\nNAO’s co-founders believe the creator economy has evolved to the point they need proper infrastructure and well-being support to handle their newly-found fame. “Young creators are now founders, storytellers and cultural voices, but they’re often navigating brand deals, pricing, legal, creative direction and community management alone,” said Plunkett.\n\nWe hear NAO plans to unveil several new talent signings in early 2026.\n\n“We’re interested in building careers,” added Olivia. “That means thoughtful partnerships, long-term ambassadorships, creative collaborations and brand work that makes sense for the talent and their audience.\n\n“We’re also intentional about helping creators build equity and IP – whether that’s through product, media, licensing or other IP-driven opportunities. There’s a huge shift happening where creators aren’t just promoting brands, they’re co-creating them, and we want our talent to be at the forefront of that. Ultimately, we prioritise deals that feel aligned, strategic and sustainable – where creators are seen as partners with perspective, not just content producers with reach.”\n\nCreator-focused agencies are popping in numbers as the industry evolves, with more and more stars who broken through on television shows signing with the newer companies or traditional agencies such as Curtis Brown, CAA or United Agents.\n\n“At the core of it, we just wanted to take everything we’d learned – the wins, the mistakes, the messy middle – and use it to help other creators’ build incredible careers that they’re proud of, from real, lived experience,” said Olivia.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T10:28:38.191173"}

After a coffee and a chat, she there and then offered him a role in Goodbye June, her directing debut that streams on Netflix from today following a limited theatrical run.\n\nA few days prior to their meeting, Heartstopper actor Akinade, acclaimed for his virtuosity on stage, was on the top deck of a London bus when his agent called with the news The Holiday, The Reader and Mildred Pierce star was directing a film and wanted to meet. “I said, ‘How the fuck does she know who I am?’”\n\nHis agent then asked if he’d like to know who he could be acting opposite. The names of Helen Mirren, Toni Collette, Timothy Spall, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Winslet herself were reeled off.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“‘What the fuck is going on?,’” he recalls spurting.\n\nThe film, written by Joe Anders, the son of Winslet and Sam Mendes, is about a matriarch of the family dying at Christmastime. Winslet wanted Akinade to play Angel, the cancer ward nurse caring for Mirren’s June, the title character, while her husband, their four children and grandchildren wait by her bedside.\n\nThe venue of the meeting was the Soho Hotel. As Akinade ran to the loo, Winslet came into view. “I thought, ‘Jesus. This is a woman I have watched since I was about 12 years old, and she’s just here in the flesh – so warm and lovely and funny and honest.’ We had coffee. She spoke about the film, spoke about herself, what she’d been up to, and then she said: ‘Well, listen, I want you to do it. There’s nobody else I’m seeing. I’m not asking anybody else.’”\n\nIt was agreed and an offer was made. Winslet then suggested he accompany her on auditioning some children for the pic, and even reading with them. They left the hotel together and Akinade recalls finding the situation “insane,” saying of Winslet, “She has an air about her that’s just very easy and breezy – I sort of liken it to how Denzel Washington and Pauletta Washington handle themselves. They’re both very famous people, but then they just get about in a way that means people aren’t flocking or hounding them.”\n\nAkinade took notice. “I do think it’s something that you cultivate,” he says. “You either choose to cultivate anonymity or you choose to cultivate fanfare.”\n\nNigerian roots\n\nAkinade was born in Liverpool, but when he was a baby he and his Nigerian parents went to Nigeria, returning to live in Manchester when he was an infant of four or five. By that time, the child could only speak Yoruba. “I knew loads of insults,” he says proudly.\n\nHis favourite phrase in Yoruba was to tell someone, “You’re the son of a goat and is your head all right?”\n\nOver breakfast at the Dean Street Restaurant in Soho, we chat about him playing nurse Angel, working with Winslet, with Judi Dench on The Vote and his analysis of the West End, and joke about what Nigerian traits we both might have. We’d been introduced a few weeks beforehand at a tea party for Winslet hosted by Netflix.\n\nI’m not sure that I want to reveal it exactly, but we laughed over how we both show our displeasure. I will say that it’s all very Nigerian!\n\nFisayo Akinade Baz\n\nFor the longest time I’d been aware of Akinade’s work on stage ever since he appeared as The Boy in a touring production of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. However, I really became aware of him when he appeared in the two dramas that Russell T Davies penned for Channel 4 in 2012, Banana and Cucumber.\n\nHe kept popping up all over the place and then Josie Rourke cast him in James Graham’s immersive 2015 general election drama The Vote at the Donmar Warehouse Theatre, where the theatrical all-star ensemble included Dame Judi, Mark Gatiss, Catherine Tate,Nina Sosanya, Timothy West, Rosalie Craig, Bill Paterson, Paul Chahidi, Jade Anouka, Jude Law, Finty Williams, Heather Craney, Hadley Fraser and Prasanna Puwanarajah.\n\nI guess the point is: who wasn’t in it?!\n\nLike Dame Judi, Akinade enjoys doing crossword puzzles. “She’s the nicest woman alive,” he says, eyes sparkling as he recalls their time working on The Vote.\n\nThe immersive production had a handful of performances leading up to a live broadcast on election night, which I was lucky enough to attend, on More4. It was timed to end on the dot at 10pm local time when polls closed.\n\n“Inbuilt into the play were cues to let you know how far ahead or behind you were,” says Akinade. “There was a point where we were a little bit behind hitting ten o’clock, and someone came on and announced the time, which meant that we were behind. Judi out of nowhere started firing her lines out so quickly, and then everybody on stage started firing their lines too and we caught up in the play, ending bang on ten. We’d never hit that target before. It was amazing,” he marvels.\n\nHowever, Akinade, in an astute analysis of the West End, feels that nowadays theater is “at a weird junction” because, he suggests, “There’s real pressure to make money and keep it robust. AI hurt and the writers and actors strikes in America hurt. You’ve got a lot of actors and and then there’s not enough money, so everyone who was doing prestige TV and film came down. The film stars started doing TV. The TV stars started doing plays, so it squeezed everybody down.”\n\nLook at the West End, for example, he argues: “There is a celebrity in almost every show, and I get it because they need to pull [audiences], but what’s going to happen is people won’t go now unless there’s somebody recognizable in a lead role.\n\n“Before you could put a play like Downstate [Bruce Norris’s controversial drama about child-sex offenders] on at the National Theatre, and people would be like, ‘It’s the greatest piece of fucking acting you will ever see from the greatest ensemble cast from [Steppenwolf] Chicago ever.’ It would sell out, whereas now, you’ve got to put your stars in, otherwise you’re screwed,” he says with concern in his voice.\n\nTo a point, because there are A-listers who are genuine creatures of the stage such as Billy Crudup and Denise Gough in High Noon at the Harold Pinter – and what about Bryan Cranston, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Paapa Essiedu in Ivo van Hove’s unbelievably powerful revival of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons at Wyndham’s Theatre? They’re all legit. “And that’s the nuance,” says Akinade. “He [Crudup] happens to be very famous – and he’s a theater actor.”\n\nL/R Fisayo Akinade and Gemma Arterton in ‘Saint Joan’ Jack Sain\n\nNot long after appearing in The Vote, the Donmar offered Akinade a role in George Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan with Gemma Arterton, but the part in question wasn’t for him. “Very early and quite riskily, I said no thank you to the Donmar,” he explains. The theater soon came back and asked him to play the Dauphin and he took it because he believes it’s the best part in the play. “It was one of the best times,” he recalls. “I just got to be a petulant king and it was so fun.”\n\nTurning down the initial part was “scary” because, “If you’re not working as an actor, you are not earning a thing,” he says. “You may have to do a few shifts in the pub, but now having been 14 years in [the business], the power of ‘no’ is so important. You really have to, for yourself, determine what you are going to do and what you will not do. What you say ‘no’ to is far more important than what you say ‘yes’ to.”\n\nWhat will he not do? “All I want to do is play roles that have interesting arcs – a character is different at the end of the thing than they are at the beginning,” he says. “They’re changed somehow. I don’t care about being the lead or supporting character.”\n\nFor example, the Reverend Hale part,which the actor played in Arthur Miller’s The Crucible directed by Lyndsey Turner at the National Theatre, is for him the greatest arc in that play because the character is “somebody that is so devout and utterly convicted – and then he sees that this divine thing he has spent his life devoted to is corruptible. I just find that shift so potent,” he reasons.\n\nL-R: Erin Doherty and Fisayo Akinade in ‘The Crucible’ Johan Persson\n\nIt’s the same reason he played Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet opposite Josh O’Connor and Jessie Buckley in director Simon Godwin’s production that was bound for the National Theatre until Covid happened and it was filmed for the National and Sky Arts.\n\nNational Theatre at home.\n\nBackground work\n\nAkinade says that Winslet set up hands-on-experience meetings with two palliative care nurses on a cancer ward at a London hospital in preparation for his role. What was important for Akinade is that Muti Akinade, his mom, has been a carer for most of his life – first with the elderly and now with people with adult learning difficulties.\n\nHe felt the role allowed him to pay homage to his mother. “The way my mum cares is very Nigerian, so it is very tough love, monumental love. She had all these amazing techniques for getting in and soothing, so that’s one aspect that I wanted to bring to Angel.”\n\nOne of the nurses Winslet introduced him to was a 30-year veteran who still had the enthusiasm for care, compassion and empathy “despite the hours, despite the pay, despite how they’re sometimes treated, despite all of the things NHS nurses have to endure.”\n\nThe nurse alos provided the actor with one of the film’s best lines. “She said, ‘When a patient comes in for end of life care, my first thought is that we have to get it right. We have to make sure this person gets a good goodbye.’”\n\nL-R: Johnny Flynn as Connor, Andrea Riseborough as Molly, Timothy Spall as Bernie, Kate Winslet as Julia and Fisayo Akinade as Angel in ‘Goodbye June’ Kimberley French/Netflix\n\nAkinade texted Winslet referencing the “good goodbye” adage and her immediate response was, “‘That’s going in the film.’ And then it did.” Sipping his coffee, he adds: “That was just so beautiful because that’s a real life quote from a real NHS nurse, and it was just very important to me to represent the NHS properly.”\n\nAs the film plays out, Angel observes the four siblings, especially the petty quarrels between the sisters played by Winslet and Riseborough. Wisely, he well understands that families bicker but knows the arguments should come later. “When your mum goes, are you going to be thinking about what happens to her ring, or are you just going to be missing your mum,” asks Akinade of his character’s motivations. “You can fight later. None of this is important.”\n\nI realize that I had watched the film through Angel’s eyes. It’s his common sense that helps get the family in shape to see what’s happening to the matriarch. I’m a fervent believer in gaining wisdom from art.\n\nAkinade agrees and says that Steven Spielberg’s film The Color Purple “was one of the most formative” he’s seen because “there’s a woman that is horrendously abused who not only finds her power, but also finds love in that.”\n\nHe watched the film with his mother at a time when he was being bullied at school. “And she knew that,” he recalls. “So she was like, ‘Come and watch this.’ She was essentially saying, ‘Look what happened to this woman. Look. And now look at her at the end. Look how happy she is. Look how free she’s about to be. You’ll be all right.’”\n\nSunday was their day to sit and watch films. It could be The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and The Clash of the Titans. One day when he was maybe 13, he watched Philadelphia, starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. “It was probably too soon, but that was deeply, profoundly moving for me and I don’t think my mum or dad at the time understood why,” says Akinade. “For me, I was like, ‘Oh, look at this man defending this gay man… with such conviction.’”\n\nIt was very surreal moment, he says, when he appeared in Jeremy O. Harris’s Slave Play featuring Olivia Washington when he got to meet her parents, Pauletta Washington and Denzel Washington. “He was just ginormous in his energy, but so warm,” says Akinade. “He turned to me and exclaimed, ’Oh, you. You’re really good.’ He pulled me into a bear hug and then sort of jokingly said, ‘If you keep going, you can be something special.’ That is all I will need for the rest of my days,” he says with a satisfied sigh.\n\nAll of this was happening around the time Denzel’s son, Malcom Washington, was preparing his film, The Piano Lesson, for that year’s awards season. Suddenly, he and I are heaping praise on Danielle Deadwyler with Akinade insisting that “somebody give her the Viola [Davis] treatment” and find her roles that catapult her star. We spend an inordinate about of time discussing the roles both Deadwyler and Davis have played on screen.\n\nL-R Helen Mirren as June and Kate Winslet as Julia in ‘Goodbye June’ Kimberley French/Netflix\n\nAkinade recalls being in a cinema and “literally levitating“ when he watched Davis standing toe-to-toe with Meryl Streep in Doubt.\n\nDuring a conversation last summer, Winslet revealed to me that Akinade’s role as Angel originally wasn’t as big a part as it has now become. “He’s so bloody good, he can do anything,” she said. The part grew through the two of them “just chatting,” is how Akinade puts it.\n\n“I would get a text every now and then saying, ‘We just added this’ or ‘I think we’re going to get you more involved in this bit.’ I thought that’s really lovely because as much as it is a film about a family’s matriarch dying and the family coming back together, I also think it’s a real love letter to carers, nurses and the NHS, and the ways in which those people in that institution take care of the entire [British] nation for free.”\n\nHe becomes visibly moved as he explains that his own father had been treated for cancer. “He beat cancer twice because of care – and he had that care for free.”\n\nAkinade reckons that because Winslet gave him so much more to do in the film, “That through line became more potent – and therefore more personal for me – because it’s just a lovely little side story.”\n\nAvoiding tokenism\n\nI love that Angel is not a black character that can be deemed token. Akinade laughs then observes sharply that this can’t be the case when it comes to the NHS, “Because you go to any hospital and who’s looking after you?” He adds: “Yes, it would have been tokenism if it wasn’t true.”\n\nHis mother was very touched by Angel when she attended the London premiere. What the character does for the family in Goodbye June is such an act of empathy and generosity, the kind that’s not often publicly highlighted. Akinade’s a big brother to two sisters. His parents live in Manchester, as does his younger sibling, while his middle sister resides in London. He loves going home to visit where “it’s the place I’m my most comfortable self anywhere.”\n\nThere was never any pressure from his parents about him becoming an actor. They knew that the life is not always the easiest, but he’s grateful that they never suggested he become a doctor. Once they saw he was getting theater work regularly and then cast in Banana and Cucumber they knew he would be alright.\n\nHis widest variety of roles have been on stage. “There’s a bit more imagination there,” he says. However, he has had the best time working on screen in all manner of shows, including Heartstopper. In the Netflix series he plays Mr. Ajayi, and lauds the series for doing “so much for young LGBTQ people.”\n\nSome people watching it, he says, “Wish they’d had this level of freedom, openness and care when I was at school because it does feel, in some cases, easier to be open and out about your sexuality or gender identity or whatever it may be now, than it was then, which is amazing.”\n\nFisayo Akinade in ‘Heartstopper’ Netflix\n\nWorking on other shows has been helpful for him, he says. “I’ve been gay a very long time, but when Cucumber was coming out I was like, ‘How do I navigate this?’ I called Russell T. Davis and he met me in Pret in Euston Station, and said, ‘There’s one question and one answer. Are you gay? Yes you are.’ He said, ‘If you don’t [embrace] that, you will spend your life terrified of being caught out and found out…You will be a half version of yourself. So are you? Yes. And on you move.’\n\n“Then you are unburdened… from the fear of being caught out. It was a scary thing [but] it actually hasn’t held me back.”\n\nQuite right too. Why should it matter? There are too many meaningless distinctions, he argues, but there are some useful ones too, he suggests. For instance, “You want to buy a sofa. When you talk to the assistant, you say, ‘I would like a soft sofa or a big sofa or an L-shaped sofa. They’re useful distinctions for what you want.\n\n“But when you say to a person, ‘Daniel Day Lewis, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, they are actors. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Forest Whittaker, Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, they’re black actors. Why? What’s the difference? The job is exactly the same. So why put in the word black or gay or northern or working class before the job of actor, what does it do? What function does that distinction have? Serves no purpose or other than to other.”\n\nContinuing, he says: “There are people that act and there are black people that act. I think that sets off prejudices in people’s heads.”\n\nBut sometimes the casting of an actor who is black can transform a role. We both jump on Cynthia Erivo in Wicked as an example. “Having a black woman play that role makes Elphaba’s difference more potent,” he says. “As soon as you include a person of color in something, it is going to be whether consciously or unconsciously, an aspect of that is going to become racialized – of course it is. Now you have Elphaba who’s green, played by a black woman. There is another layer, another nuance, that is challenging audiences to invest on a deeper level.”\n\nUpcoming he has a television drama which for now he’s not able to discuss. In any event, he says he’s lucky to have worked with great stars such as Mirren and Dench. Initially, he admits he was “scared’” of meeting the former “because she’s Helen Mirren,” but he didn’t need to worry. “She was just the loveliest, so not starry and down to earth.”\n\nThe same was true for Dame Judi. When they did a run-through of The Vote at a church hall in Islington, he arrived early, and Dench and Finty Williams, her daughter, pitched up shortly afterwards. “She went, ’Hello, I’m Judi’… And she went, ‘Feel my palm. Feel it… that’s cold sweat. I’m fucking terrified. Don’t judge me on what I do today.’ I said, ‘But you’re fucking Judi Dench!’ She said, ‘I fucking know who I am. Don’t judge me.’ And I was like, ‘Well, I won’t. Of course not.’”\n\nFisayo Akinade is already a great actor and a deeply caring dude. That’s why he steals Goodbye June with one tiny line.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:18:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:24:24.795144"}

Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo is back after a 12-year absence to the West End, as Deadline was first to report, to play all 23 roles in a bloodthirsty version of Dracula. Josh O’Connor, a lead in next year’s Steven Spielberg blockbuster Disclosure Day, will trace the downfall of a classical violinist who opts instead for a bruising life as a boxer in a rare revival of Clifford Odets’ Golden Boy.\n\nSo why do they do it? They’re both screen idols in demand and their agents have endless goodies lined up for them, yet they’d rather face the harsh glare of a follow spot.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nErivo & O’Connor\n\nJosh O’Connor Theo Wargo/Getty Images\n\nBoth Erivo and O’Connor are legitimate creatures of the stage and both tell me they miss it. They also say that it terrifies them. “It’s like running towards the fire,” Erivo says. “I’m doing Dracula because it scares the sh*t out of me,” they add.\n\nO’Connor says he wants to re-experience the danger of performing in front of a live audience where there’s “no safety net.”\n\nDuring a chat with him as he wraps on Spielberg’s picture, he chose the word that sums it all up: “It’s the fear. Actors love it.”\n\nErivo is now in London sinking her teeth into rehearsals with director Kip Williams for the 112 performances they will give at the Noel Coward Theatre over a 15-week season beginning February 4. Should they need to take a flight to attend awards shows across the pond, some dates have been blocked off.\n\nCynthia Erivo at the “Wicked: For Good” New York premiere Getty Images\n\nThe Tony winner and Oscar nominee was last on stage in the West End when they appeared with Harriet Walter in Phyllida Lloyd’s production of Henry IV, set in a prison, at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014. From there, Erivo headed to Broadway to play Celie in The Color Purple. They tell us that they’re using their own talon-like fingernails to play Bram Stoker’s vampire.\n\nTheir astonishing performance as Elphaba in Jon M. Chu’s two Wicked moves proves they have the stamina to command the stage of the Noel Coward, performing multiple roles. Erivo says they were convinced they could do it after seeing Sarah Snook play 26 different characters in The Picture of Dorian Gray on Broadway.\n\nBoth Dracula and Dorian Gray originated out of the Sydney Theatre Company and were directed by Williams. Producers Michael Cassel and Adam Kenwright are responsible for bringing them to London. Snook took The Picture of Dorian Gray to Broadway, and although no one’s saying so out loud, Dracula is likely going to rest in their sarcophagus and be transported to New York as well.\n\nSam Yates, who directed Andrew Scott in Vanya at the Old Vic and in New York, will begin rehearsals with O’Connor and the Golden Boy company as soon as The Crown, Challengers and God’s Own Country star completes red carpet duties for Disclosure Day, which opens June 12.\n\nO’Connor, currently seen in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, The Mastermind and The History of Sound, also needs to get into prizefighting shape for Golden Boy, which runs at the Almeida from September 8-October 31.\n\nSwinton & Oldman\n\nTilda Swinton Courtesy Royal Court\n\nElsewhere, Oscar-winning actors Tilda Swinton and Gary Oldman are both returning to their theatrical roots at the same address, the Royal Court in Sloane Square, to help celebrate its 70th anniversary.\n\nThe last time Swinton trod the boards was in Manfred Karger’s Man to Man for the play’s 1988 London premiere. It had transferred down from Edinburgh’s Traverse Theatre where it originated in 1987 with Swinton taking up the solo role of Ella Gericke, a German widow who, beginning in the 1930s, assumes the identity and work of Max, her deceased husband, to help her through years of tumultuous upheaval in her country. I saw her do it at the Royal Court and she was pretty remarkable; thrilling that Swinton has signed up to take the part on again with Man to Man‘s original creative team led by director Stephen Unwin.\n\nI’m curious to see if Swinton’s reemergence on stage encourages her to perform more in the theater. Don’t want to boast, but I’m going to anyway — I saw her perform a variety of roles opposite the likes of Judi Dench and Peggy Mount in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s legendary 1982-85 seasons at Stratford-upon-Avon and the Barbican, in Mother Courage and Her Children (with Dench and Zoë Wanamaker) and Measure for Measure (with Mount, Daniel Massey and Juliet Stevenson playing Isabella). Swinton had small and large roles in other plays that performed in the repertory.\n\nThe very last time Swinton took a bow was in Unwin’s production of Peter Handke’s The Long Way Round at the National Theatre 35 years ago. Having seen it, I can understand why she stayed away so long!\n\nMan to Man plays the Royal Court’s Jerwood Theatre Downstairs begins September 5. It will transfer to New York in spring 2027.\n\nGary Oldman Dan Doperalski/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty Images\n\nSlow Horses star Oldman precedes Swinton into the Jerwood Downstairs with Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape, which originated at the Royal Court in 1958. Oldman recently revived the one-man drama, in which he both starred in and directed, at York Theatre Royal last April and May.\n\nOldman performed in a series of plays at the Royal Court over a two-year period beginning in 1985, culminating in a breathtaking performance opposite Lesley Manville in Serious Money, Caryl Churchill’s ferocious takedown of high finance.\n\nKrapp’s Last Tape runs from May 8.\n\nChris Pine\n\nChris Pine and ‘Ivanov’ The Bridge Theatre\n\nChris Pine (Star Trek, Into the Woods) makes his London stage debut as Anton Chekhov’s angst-ridden Nikolai Ivanov in a new adaptation of Ivanov by Simon Stone running at the Bridge Theatre from July 4-September 19.\n\nSome folk I know rolled their eyes when they heard about Pine’s casting to play a man undone by his own malaise. But Pine’s a classically trained thespian who studied at UC Berkeley and Leeds University before undertaking further acting courses at ACT in San Francisco. I feel we shouldn’t disdain American screen actors who come here to tread our boards with serious intent. Although it’s true that some, more homegrown than Americans, do venture from screen to stage and it’s clear they haven’t the chops for it, still they rake in the money at the box office in any old slop, and audiences leave disappointed because the star from the telly was a dud. Tis’ not the season to name names.\n\nIvanov’s tricky to pull off so kudos to Pine for running towards the fire. By the way, my benchmark for Ivanov, gawd knows I’ve seen a few, is Ralph Fiennes who was luminous in a crackerjack production that Jonathan Kent directed at the Almeida in 1997 from a version by David Hare.\n\nIvanov plays the Bridge Theatre from July 4-September 19.\n\nRosamund Pike in ‘Inter Alia’ Mads Perch\n\nTom Stoppard had already approved the casting for the Old Vic’s revival of his 1993 masterpiece Arcadia before he died late last month. Carrie Cracknell’s now in rehearsals with a company that includes Isis Hainsworth, Seamus Dillane, Prasanna Puwanarajah, Leila Fazad, Fiona Button, Holly Godliman, Angus Cooper, Gabriel Akuwudike and William Lawlor. The story is that of a child prodigy and theories of literary scandal and scientific intrigue that moves between two eras.\n\nFelicity Kendal, Bill Nighy, Harriet Walter, Samuel West and Emma Fielding were in the original company at the National that Trevor Nunn directed. What an opening night that was!\n\nKendal, a Stoppard muse, can be seen currently in the playwright’s 1995 play Indian Ink directed by Jonathan Kent at Hampstead Theatre until January 31.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl, The Wheel of Time) reprises her star turn in the transfer of Suzie Miller’s searing legal drama Inter Alia from the National, where it was a sold-out hit, to Wyndham’s Theatre from March 19-June 20.\n\nPike is joined by Jamie Glover, who played her husband in the NT production directed by Justin Martin. It’s about a karaoke-loving Old Bailey judge who finds herself at the center of an ethical conundrum involving her college-age son.\n\nMiller’s other legal scorcher, Prima Facie, is going on tour. The one-woman drama, a soaraway success in London and on Broadway, saw Jodie Comer win Tony, Olivier, Evening Standard and all the silverware going for her portrait of an attorney who represents alleged sexual offenders and is herself raped. Play opens at Richmond Theatre, south west of London, on January 23 and then plays eight other dates from Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre to the Playhouse in Liverpool, wrapping there March 21.\n\nClint Dyer (Get Up, Stand Up!, Death of England Plays), the former National Theatre deputy artistic director and now an NT Artistic Associate, directs Aaron Pierre (The Morning Show, Lanterns, Rebel Ridge, The Underground Railroad) playing Randle P. McMurphy in the stage production of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest adapted by Dale Wasserman.\n\nAaron Pierre Peyton Fulford\n\nOlivier Award-winner Giles Terera (Hamilton, Rosmersholm, Othello), a frequent collaborator of Dyer’s, plays Dale Harding, the savviest patient in the psychiatric facility who initially locks horns with McMurphy. The play runs at the Old Vic from April 1-May 23. William Redfield (A New Leaf, Death Wish) played Harding in Milos Forman’s classic 1975 movie, and we all know Jack Nicholson took on McMurphy.\n\nI’m hearing of some cool casting ideas in the works for Nurse Ratched, who was played by Louise Fletcher in the film.\n\nDyer also directs Letitia Wright (Black Panther, Small Axe) in the UK premiere of Tracey Scott Wilson’s incendiary drama The Story, about a reporter who clashes with their editor (what’s new!) over a hot-button issue. Throw in some racism and journalistic ethics into the mix.\n\nLetitia Wright Jeff Spicer/Getty for Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nMarianne Elliott directs a major-league revival of Christopher Hampton’s Les Liasons Dangereuses from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ epistolary novel starring Lesley Manville, Monica Barbaro and Aidan Turner at the National from March 21-June 6.\n\nAlso National Theatre bound is the musical adaptation of the 2014 movie Pride written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus. They reunite for this new show, which has been developed by Warchus with Beresford writing the book and lyrics, with music by Christopher Nightingale, Josh Cohen and DJ Walde.\n\nLesley Manville and Aidan Turner in artwork for ‘Les Liasons Dangereuses’ National Theatre\n\nPride is inspired by the true tale of how a group known as “Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners” came to the aid of a Welsh pit village during the 1984 miner’s strike. The movie starred Ben Schnetzer, Andrew Scott, Imelda Staunton, Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, George MacKay, Dominic West, Monica Dolan and Liz White.\n\nThe musical plays the National’s Dorfman Theatre from June 11-September 12.\n\nHowever, the keenest amongst you should scoot off to Cardiff’s Sherman Theatre for Pride’s outta town world premiere from March 31 through April 18.\n\nHappy Valley’s Siobhan Finneran stars in J.B. Priestley’s great farce When We Are Married, which is on now at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Tim Sheader, until February 7. Finnegan’s joined by Samantha Spiro, Sophie Thompson, Tori Allen-Martin, Leo Wringer and Ron Cook.\n\n(L-R) Sophie Thompson, Siobhan Finneran and Samantha Spiro in ‘When We Are Married’ Johan Persson\n\nThe best ever production of When We Are Married starred Patricia Routledge, Timothy West, Prunella Scales, Brian Murphy, Bill Fraser, Patsy Rowlands and Patricia Hayes at the old Whitehall Theatre (now the Trafalgar) in 1985. Watching them was pure comedy gold.\n\nFollowing Finneran and company into the Donmar from February 14 is Anastasia Hille (The Bletchley Circle, A Gentleman in Moscow) and Erin Kellyman (28 Years Later, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) in the world premiere of Evening All Afternoon by Anna Ziegler (Photograph 51), about how a stepmother and her stepdaughter summon quiet courage “to open their hearts again.”\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor has been spotted at rehearsals in Clapham, South London for the Royal Shakespeare Company’s musical adaptation of The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, based on Ejiofor’s 2019 Netflix movie about how schoolboy William Kamkwamba, then aged 13, saved his village in Malawi from famine by devising a windmill from scratch to provide electricity to pump water and irrigate crops.\n\nEjiofor has been appointed the show’s creative associate and is on hand should director Lynette Linton, the cast and creatives require any guidance related to the story. Kenny Wax, who holds the West End rights, tells me that the cast, with Alistair Nwachukwu as William, have been “raising the roof” over at the RSC’s London rehearsal hall. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind opens at the RSC’s Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon on February 10 and runs through March 28. The show features book and lyrics by Richy Hughes and music and lyrics by Tim Sutton.\n\nIt then transfers to @sohoplace in the West End from April 25-July 18.\n\nAlistair Nwachukwu Dujonna\n\nNwachukwu was a member of the ensemble that performed in the excellent play The Line of Beauty, based on Alan Hollinghurst’s bestselling novel. It was directed by Michael Grandage and adapted by Jack Holden, who described it as a drama “about class and furniture.” Anyhow, there’s no word yet on when, where and casting, but it’s likely to transfer into the West End. Jasper Talbot, Leo Surer, Ellie Bamber, Arty Froushan, Charles Edwards, Claudia Harrison, Robert Portal and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers were at the top of their game when I caught the final Almeida performance.\n\nThe aforementioned Froushan will headline, as we reported here recently, a revised revival of the musical version of Bret Easton Ellis’ notorious novel American Psycho directed again by Rupert Goold. Show features a book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik. It runs at the Almeida from January 22-March 14.\n\nMore from the RSC: Kenneth Branagh returns to Stratford’s Royal Shakespeare Theatre to play Prospero in The Tempest, directed by Richard Eyre, with performances from May 13 through June 20.\n\nBranagh also appears with Academy Award-winning Helen Hunt making her RSC debut as Ranyevskaya in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard directed by Tamara Harvey from a new version by Laura Wade. A limited season at The Swan Theatre runs July 10-August 29.\n\nHelen Hunt\n\nMark Gatiss also debuts at the RSC in Bertolt Brecht’s The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, in a version by Stephen Sharkey that’s directed by Seán Linnen, also at The Swan, from April 11 through May 30.\n\nHigh Noon, adapted from the classic Western by Eric Roth, is in previews at the Harold Pinter Theatre with Billy Crudup and Denise Gough playing, and expanding, the roles played by Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly in Fred Zinnemann’s movie written by Carl Forman. Roth tells me it’s about “courage.”\n\nArthur Miller’s All My Sons is unmissable at Wyndham’s Theatre starring Bryan Cranston, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Glynn-Carney and Hayley Squires. The magnificent production directed by Ivo van Hove opened to rave notices a few weeks back, but it runs until March 7.\n\nAnd we delivered you the scoop on Sadie Sink (Stranger Things) and Noah Jupe (Hamnet) making their West End debuts in Romeo & Juliet directed by Robert Icke, which runs at the Harold Pinter Theatre beginning March 16 for a limited season until June 6. The full company rehearse late January.\n\nSadie Sink and Noah Jupe Helen Murray\n\nA tip: Theo Jamieson, musical director at the Royal Shakespeare Company, has written the book, music and lyrics for a new musical developed at the National Theatre Studio called Flyby. There’s talk of it heading to Southwark Theatre at some point next year starring Poppy Gilbert (Sherwood, Chloe). From what I’m hearing, Gilbert is a revelation.\n\nYou heard it here first.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:24:25.062328"}

Trump urged CBS to pull the plug on Colbert’s show “NOW” instead of ending its run next May.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Stephen Colbert is a pathetic trainwreck, with no talent or anything else necessary for show business success,” Trump wrote in a post at 12:16 a.m. ET on his Truth Social platform. “Now, after being terminated by CBS, but left out to dry, he has actually gotten worse, along with his nonexistent ratings. Stephen is running on hatred and fumes ~ A dead man walking! CBS should, ‘put him to sleep,’ NOW, it is the humanitarian thing to do!”\n\nSeven minutes later, Trump followed up with this: “Who has the worst Late Night host, CBS, ABC, or NBC??? They all have three things in common: High Salaries, No Talent, REALLY LOW RATINGS!”\n\nTrump also reiterated his call for the U.S. government to revoke TV broadcasters’ licenses. “If Network NEWSCASTS, and their Late Night Shows, are almost 100% Negative to President Donald J. Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party, shouldn’t their very valuable Broadcast Licenses be terminated? I say, YES!” Then, three minutes after that post, the president shared, “MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!”\n\nThe episode of “The Late Show” that CBS aired on Dec. 23 was a rerun, featuring guests Sigourney Weaver and Mandy Patinkin. It originally aired on Dec. 8 — and that night, Colbert took several shots at Trump, including his takeover of the Kennedy Center and his move to seize hosting duties at the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n“This year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony is the very first since Trump installed himself as chair of the Kennedy Center’s board,” Colbert said in his monologue, eliciting boos from the audience. In response, Colbert said, “Yeah, I kind of agree. It seems like the commander-in-chief shouldn’t have enough time to run a theater. ‘Mr. President, Mr. President, Russia has just launched another round of missiles. But first, dress rehearsal for ‘Oklahoma’ is underway, and the blocking is uninspired,'” Colbert joked.\n\nAt another point, Colbert admitted, “I don’t know how much effort I’m putting into the impression [of Trump] anymore. And I don’t care… Fire me!”\n\nColbert also played some of Trump’s remarks in which “he pre-complained about how people will judge his hosting” of the Kennedy Center Honors, according to Colbert. Trump had claimed that as the ceremony’s host, “Jimmy Kimmel was horrible…. If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be president.” To which Colbert quipped: “You can’t and you shouldn’t.”\n\nThen Colbert fact-checked Trump. “Just a quick brain check for Grandpa Puddin’ Skull: I called [Kimmel] and Jimmy Kimmel has never hosted the Kennedy Center Honors,” eliciting a huge laugh from the audience. “But here’s the thing: I did, the three years leading up to Trump becoming president.”\n\nIn the monologue, Colbert also made fun of Trump for receiving the “fake” inaugural FIFA Peace Prize award “after years of campaigning unsuccessfully for the Nobel Peace Prize.”\n\n“Later that same day, Trump also received the Hooters National Book Award,” Colbert joshed. “It was the breast of times, it was the worst of boobs.” The CBS host said Trump’s FIFA Peace Prize is “like for Christmas if you ask your mom for a Super Nintendo and she gets you something called ‘Super Retendo.’ It comes with ‘Super Marion Brothers’ and ‘Legend of Kelvin.'” Colbert said FIFA president Gianni Infantino “pulled on all the stops for Trump’s Big Boy Trophy Party,” adding that in a photo showing Trump picking up the medal Infantino awarded to him, the president “looks like a goblin asking if it’s OK to eat a third baby.”\n\nAfter CBS announced this summer that “The Late Show” would be ending in May 2026, Trump gloated that “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.” A few days later on the show, Colbert fired back, telling the president, “Go fuck yourself” (with the f-word censored).\n\nCBS, in announcing the cancellation of “The Late Show,” insisted the move was “purely a financial decision” that came after a years-long decline in the economics of late-night TV.\n\nIn its Dec. 23 broadcast of the Kennedy Center Honors, CBS did not refer to the place as the “Trump Kennedy Center,” largely because the ceremony was recorded before Trump’s name was screwed on to the building last week. CBS News’ standards department instructed staffers last week to maintain the original Kennedy Center name in their coverage, the Washington Post reported. “If the president or other administration officials use the new name in a soundbite that is their prerogative,” the news org said.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:48:17 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:55:18.276428"}
