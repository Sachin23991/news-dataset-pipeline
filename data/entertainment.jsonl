[&#8230;]", "content": "Theater owners are preparing for a very merry Christmas season.\n\nThis holiday might not be one for the record books, but the lineup of films offers something important — a range of genres and styles — as exhibitors brace for what’s usually the busiest stretch of the year. That’s an important distinction in post-COVID times. Since the pandemic, cinema operators have relied on one billion-dollar behemoth (“Spider-Man: No Way Home” in 2021 and “Avatar: The Way of Water” in 2022) or struggled with none at all (“Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” floundered in 2023 and while “Mufasa” rebounded after a soft start in 2024, “The Lion King” prequel couldn’t claw its way to the billion-dollar mark).\n\nThis year, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will continue to dominate but James Cameron’s sci-fi threequel won’t be alone in enticing audiences. Over the weekend, a trio of holiday releases — A24’s R-rated ping-pong adventure “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” — hope to cater to moviegoers young, old, or disinterested in returning to the alien planet of Pandora.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is aiming for $55 million to $65 million over the traditional weekend and $75 million to $80 million through the four-day holiday frame. Those ticket sales would mark a 30% to 40% decline from its $89 million domestic debut. For context, “Avatar: The Way of Water” dropped by 52% in its sophomore outing after a significantly stronger $134 million debut. Disney and 20th Century’s “Avatar” franchise appears be experiencing diminishing returns, though it’s important to remember these films aren’t known for explosive opening weekends. Instead, “Avatar” installments enjoy exceptional staying power, sticking around at the top of the box office for weeks on end. The first two films, which each ended up grossing over $2 billion globally, were No. 1 for seven consecutive weekends. Barring a surprise, “Fire and Ash” should remain atop the charts in North America well into the new year.\n\nIn terms of new releases, Jack Black and Paul Rudd’s “Anaconda” is expected to lead the pack with $20 million from 3,400 venues between Christmas on Thursday and Sunday. “Marty Supreme” is targeting $12 million to $20 million, while “Song Song Blue” is projected to earn $10 million to $14 million from 2,400 theaters. In general, Christmas releases don’t always deliver huge debuts but tend to play and play on the big screen into January and beyond.\n\n“Anaconda” cost $45 million to produce. A meta-reboot, “Anaconda” follows best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie (you guessed it!) 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down.\n\n“Marty Supreme” had a rollicking start in limited release, breaking into the top 10 with $875,000 while playing on just six screens. Those initial returns are promising ahead of the nationwide expansion, which will test the $70 million-budgeted film’s commercial viability. It helps that Timothée Chalamet, who stars as the fictional table tennis champ Marty Mauser, has been rewriting the rules of movie marketing in terms of getting out the word for an original film. “Marty Supreme” has generated great reviews and encouraging word of mouth. Now the question is: Will Chalamet’s viral antics translate to ticket sales?\n\n“Song Sung Blue” carries a modest $30 million production budget. Craig Brewer directed the film, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band. Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman praised “Song Sung Blue” as “a winning pop nostalgia trip with a dark side.”\n\nWith just two weeks to go, overall domestic revenues are hovering at $8.37 billion, just 1.3% ahead of last year and 22.4% behind 2019, according to Comscore. It’s been a wobbly year with several hits (“Lilo & Stitch,” “Zootopia 2,” “A Minecraft Movie” and “Demon Slayer,” among others) but not enough to offset a number of big-budget flops (“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” and “Snow White,” to name a few). Projections for 2025 were already revised down to $9 billion, but after a brutal fall season, even that milestone feels like a stretch. Will these holiday offerings be able to deliver, or is the box office doomed to fall short of $9 billion for the second consecutive year?", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:52.942238"}

But the [&#8230;]", "content": "If all you know or remember of the eponymous biblical character’s story is that he defeated a hulking giant with a humble slingshot, then “David” might have some surprises in store for you — chief among them, the fact that the film continues for a full hour after this famous, seemingly climactic showdown. But the films of Angel Studios, by and large, are not for audiences only vaguely acquainted with the Bible, and this surprisingly slick animated feature will play best with viewers who can see its every narrative turn coming. That is a sizeable demographic: Released wide last weekend, Brent Dawes and Phil Cunningham‘s film overperformed notably at the box office, landing in the runner-up spot to “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” and aptly defeating relative toon Goliath “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.”\n\nThis is all a perfectly on-the-nose outcome for a tale preaching the message that one must never underestimate the modest and pious when they’re up against the wealthy and decadent. (Or whatever moral descriptor applies to SpongeBob.) But “David” attains its success by cribbing from the playbook of far mightier animation houses: There are shades here of Disney and DreamWorks — the latter’s scripture-based hit “The Prince of Egypt,” in particular — in everything from the film’s character design to its original song score, making for a proficient family entertainment that’s nonetheless a little too precision-engineered to feel truly stirring. Faith, “David” has in spades; soul, not so much.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWith Pixar-wide eyes and a mop of intricately tousled, treacle-brown hair, the young David (voiced by Brandon Engman) presents here as a plucky, intrepid moppet in the typical cartoon-hero mold. He’s introduced as a keen musician and lowly shepherd’s son, dutifully minding his father’s flock on the outskirts of Bethlehem, before swiftly launching into his generic “I want” song, the first of several peppily template-based but swiftly forgettable compositions by Grammy-winning Christian artist Jonas Myrin. Like any cutely drawn protagonist in his position, he yearns for bigger things, though he gets more than he bargained for when — after valiantly protecting his sheep from a preying lion — he’s summoned before the Prophet Samuel (Brian Stivale), who anoints the nonplussed lad the future king of Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, the present king, the insecure and short-tempered Saul (Adam Michael Gold), is facing rejection by God and a declaration of war by preening Philistine monarch King Achish (British comedian Asim Chaudhry, offering something of a throwback to limp-wristed comic stereotypes). Enter David, brought into Saul’s court to soothe the king’s anxieties with his deft lyre-playing, though the tyke soon proves an unexpected military asset: Cue the famed face-off against Goliath, which is quite dazzlingly staged in a vast field of scarlet poppies, petals spraying like confetti when the iceberg-sized monster hits the ground.\n\nTaking place around the 50-minute mark, this scene proves both the narrative and aesthetic peak of a film that, clocking in at an indifferently paced 110 minutes, could test the patience of younger children. Everything that happens after, as David grows into a strapping, stout-hearted man (now voiced by Christian singer-songwriter Phil Wickham) and eventually challenges Saul for the throne that is rightly his, is checked off in fairly rote fashion. Expanding on their 2023 Angel Studios miniseries “Young David,” Dawes and Cunningham obviously hew closely to the Book of Samuel — this isn’t the genre for significant creative license — but also to the familiar rules of any Hollywood hero’s journey.\n\nNone of which would be a debit if their David had a little more personality of his own, but he remains a stubbornly dull anchor for the film, bound by the generally humorless, declamatory tone of the writing. Supporting characters are similarly lacking in wit or detail, while the film’s vocal performances (save for Chaudhry’s odd caricature) are adequate but not especially distinctive. It follows that the faces on screen are perhaps the least characterful element of the film’s generally impressive visual design.\n\nEverything around them, however, is vividly realized, and occasionally even inspired. “David” is nothing if not a spectacular showcase for the technical capabilities of South African animation house Sunrise Productions — demonstrated here both at a large scale, in the palpably dusty, sun-scorched vistas of ancient Israel, and in small, supple glimmers of fire and water. One musical number, “Tapestry,” registers as a standout not for the song but for its visual treatment amid a busy weaving workshop overhung by cotton-candy bales of pastel-dyed wool. Indeed, textiles are perhaps the most consistent marvel of “David,” as even the ecru hessian of the title character’s shepherding smock is rendered with textured, tactile specificity. Reveling in the material may go somewhat against the film’s principles, but respecting the little things does not.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:28:54 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:53.215189"}

Joyce Beatty (D-OH) filed the lawsuit on Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeking a declaration that the name of the arts institution is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and that a board vote last week to change the name is null and void.\n\n“Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center’s name requires an act of Congress,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “But on December 18 and 19, 2025—in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic—the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order. Congress intended the Center to be a living memorial to President Kennedy—and a crown jewel of the arts for all Americans, irrespective of party. Unless and until this Court intervenes, Defendants will continue to defy Congress and thwart the law for improper ends.”\n\nThe Trump controlled board voted to rename the center on Thursday. The next day, workers added Trump’s name to the facade of the complex, so it reads “The Donald Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe lawsuit named Trump, who is chairman of the Kennedy Center, as well as its president, Ric Grenell, and the members of the board, along with the institution itself. Also named are other ex officio members, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr., House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nThe lawsuit cited breach of trustees obligations under federal law and violation of plaintiff’s rights under federal law, among other claims.\n\nBeatty also is seeking an order that “any and all physical and digital signage purporting to\n\nrename the Kennedy Center after Defendant Trump, including the signage on the building’s\n\nfront portico and the website.”\n\nThe center did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Beatty’s lawsuit.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed a law in 1964 designating the National Cultural Center as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. After the Trump-controlled board voted, Democrats and members of the Kennedy family quickly cried foul.\n\nThe lawsuit called the board vote a “sham.”\n\n“The conduct in the Board meeting itself confirmed that the meeting was a sham, orchestrated by Defendant Trump and his loyalists as a pretext for a predetermined result,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “There was no advance notice in the agenda that the Board would be considering a name change. The meeting was held at the home of Andrea Wynn, the wife of a casino mogul and Republican donor, whom Defendant Trump installed on the Board. At the end of the meeting, Defendant Trump’s loyalists abruptly announced that they had news they would like to share: the Kennedy Center would now be renamed after Donald Trump.”\n\nBeatty was on the board meeting call, but was blocked from expressing her concerns because she was put on mute, according to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center later said that ex officio members do not have a vote, something codified in the center’s bylaws.\n\nBut Beatty’s lawsuit contended that the “law does not distinguish between the ex officio trustees and general trustees, and the former possess the same rights and responsibilities as the latter.”\n\nRoma Daravi, spokeswoman for the center, defended the board’s authority to change the name. “This action is in line with the precedent of the State Department adding President Trump’s name to the Institute of Peace. And the previous Administration renaming military bases,” she said in a statement last week. Yet the effort to strip military bases of Confederate names was authorized by an act of Congress in 2021, something that critics of the Kennedy Center renaming say is required.\n\nThe lawsuit also contended that the “purported name change will impose financial and operational harms on this already struggling institution by alienating ticket holders, donors, and artists.” The lawsuit noted that after the name change, musician Kristy Lee announced that she was canceling her Jan. 14, 2026 performance. “On information and belief, ticket holders have canceled their tickets in protest of Defendants’ unlawful actions and demanded refunds. There is every reason to expect this trend will continue, with associated financial and reputational harms,” the lawsuit stated.\n\nBeatty is represented by Norman Eisen, founder of Democracy Defenders Action, and Nathaniel Zelinsky, senior counsel at Washington Litigation Group.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 02:50:25 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:55.164916"}

The experimental drama examines the social pressures of competitive sports, the use of technology and social media applied to sports, and the link between sports and war, providing a fresh and realistic look at contemporary athletic agonism.\n\nThe film stars Italian judo athlete and Olympic Gold medalist Alice Bellandi and “La Chimera” stars Yile Vianello and Sofija Zobina.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFollowing its premiere in the Venice Film Festival’s Critics’ Week in September, “Agon” was released in Italian cinemas, kicking off Mubi’s Italian theatrical release slate, and has travelled widely on the festival circuit including the Rio, Thessaloniki, Geneva, and Brisbane fests.\n\nBertelli speaks to Variety about his personal connection to the film’s subject matter and how he brought Mubi and The Match Factory on board as producer, Italian theatrical distributor, and global distributor.\n\nYou’ve been involved with the Italian sailing team that competed in the America’s Cup. Is that what prompted you to depict the world of highly competitive sports?\n\nYes, I definitely have a personal connection to this film. But there is also a broader context. It’s true that “Agon” is centred around the world of sports. And of course it’s open to interpretations. But I also use the sports world backdrop of these fictional Olympics that are almost a geopolitical platform, to make a reflection on the role that competitive sports have taken on over the past century. And also to talk more in general about the feeling in life of not being able to achieve one’s goal. So, at one level it’s also the story of three teenagers who are unable to do what they want. This is observed very differently with respect to each character, ​​contextualising this journey in the preparation for competition in a minor sports category of a hypothetical Olympics. Then there’s the broader issue of macro connections between how we came to call sports what they are today. Where does that comes from? And the relationship between war, violence, and sports.\n\nTalk to me about your decision to cast real life world champion judo athlete Alice Bellandi in the film.\n\nI initially conceived “Agon” as an animation project. Then, when I decided to make it live-action, I had two big problems. One was: how do I give it a realistic flavour that establishes trust with the audience? For fencing, I knew I could use a stunt person because in fencing you wear a mask. With shooting, I also knew that it was not a big problem because the athlete has to be very still. But when it comes to judo, I knew I had to find a real judoka. Then reality surpassed my expectations when I met Bellandi, who agreed to be in the film. Then five months after we shot she won the Olympic gold medal in Paris.\n\nIn simplistic terms, “Agon” explores the relationship between sports and technology, which is very clear in competitive sailing. Talk to me about how you weaved this into the film’s narrative.\n\nI’m interested in the relationship between sports and technology, but in a broader sense, which is what I think I’ll continue to look at in the future. What really interests me is the rapport between the organic world and technology, “organic” pertaining to the body in this movie. One example is the surgery [scene] in the film, which is obviously a very crude scene. For me it’s very important because it’s not a metaphor. There are other directors who have addressed this theme [of technology and the body] using metaphorical devices that have shaped my imagination. But I’m fascinated by looking at this [rapport] where it doesn’t exist as a metaphor, but exists purely as reality: a robot that digs into the flesh, into the blood.\n\nTalk to me about your relationship with Mubi. How did you bring them on board in such a big way?\n\nActually, Mubi was involved in “Agon” since the beginning, before anyone else. When I wrote this story as an animation project, I wasn’t actually actively trying to get this film off the ground. I met Efe Cackarel in 2017 when Mubi was much smaller than it is now. We talked about it. I mentioned that I had this story in mind and I’d like to maybe make movies in the future. He said: “I’m interested. I’m also interested in starting to produce in the future and not just be a platform. Why don’t you write the screenplay?” So I wrote the screenplay and started talking about it directly with Mubi. At first we started developing it directly in London as an animation film, but then we realised that it would be too expensive and complex to do it as an animation project.\n\nMeanwhile, my life was changing. I thought: “maybe this could actually be my first feature film. And Efe, rightly, said to me: “Look, you need you to find a producer to take this project forward. But we are on board.” So, with [Italian producer] Max Brun, I introduced myself to Jules Daley, who had just come out of RSA Films. She loved the project and decided to help me and become my producer on this film. So, little by little, “Agon” was born. Then, when the project began to take shape, Mubi came on board. From the very beginning, there was the idea that they would distribute it. But they also became an equity investor. At that point, Mubi had acquired, or was in the process of acquiring, The Match Factory. So, to my great joy, I found myself working with The Match Factory as an international sales agent. Then they said: “Instead of selling the project, we’ll distribute it directly in Italy, because they wanted to start distributing in Italy.”\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:15:22 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T15:30:56.043423"}

In a twist, Captain America is the father to a newborn child.\n\nMarvel is slowly building up to “Doomsday,” which hits theaters in a little less than a year. There will reportedly be more teasers that focus on other characters in the coming weeks. The Captain America trailer leaked online in the run-up to its theatrical debut, and a Thor-focused teaser also appeared in social media leaks this week. It’s expected that it too will run in theaters with showings of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” beginning Thursday, like the Cap teaser.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nJoe and Anthony Russo, who previously directed “Captain America: Winter Soldier,” “Captain America: Civil War,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame” and are back for “Doomsday,” released a short statement on their Instagram page.\n\n“The character that changed our lives,” they wrote of Captain America. “The story that brought us all here together. It was always going to come back to this…”\n\nThe teaser, set on a peaceful farm, begins with Steve riding a motorcycle up to his home as a piano rendition of the “Avengers” theme plays in the background. His blue helmet is reminiscent of his Captain America costume, which he pulls out to reminiscently admire. He holds a newborn baby and looks proudly, as the teaser ends with “Steve Rogers will return for ‘Avengers: Doomsday.'” A countdown timer begins at the end that’s set to expire when “Doomsday” hits theaters.\n\nMarvel fans last saw Captain America, the founding Avenger, in the closing moments of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.” After saving the world from the purple villain known as Thanos, Cap makes it his personal mission to return the missing Infinity Stones to their rightful places across time. After finishing his time-traveling mission, an elderly Steve returns to the main MCU timeline and passes down his red-and-white Vibranium shield to his former sidekick, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), upgrading him from the Falcon to the new Captain America. After bestowing his shield to Sam, Steve then goes back in time to reunite with his beloved Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).\n\nAfter Steve went missing and was frozen in the ice in the original “Captain America” movie, Peggy grew old but never stopped loving him. Now with the Quantum Realm time-traveling technology, the two were able to get married and live out their lives together through the decades.\n\nDoes this teaser mean that Steve somehow returns to the main MCU timeline to rejoin the Avengers? Is this the same Cap, or is he a variant of the elderly hero from the finale of “Endgame”? And who’s the baby. Does he or she have super-soldier powers like Cap?\n\nMarvel also dropped the first poster for “Doomsday,” tinged in a green hue very similar to the colors of Doctor Doom’s famous costume.\n\nTechnically, this isn’t Evans’ first time back in the MCU since “Endgame.” In 2024’s billion-dollar smash “Deadpool & Wolverine,” he returned for a hilarious cameo as the Human Torch, his original superhero role way back in Fox’s “Fantastic Four” movie from 2005.\n\nIn an Esquire profile of Mackie from earlier this year, ahead of the former Falcon taking on the Cap mantle in “Captain America: Brave New World,” Evans said that he was “happily retired” and denied reports that he would return to Marvel.\n\n“That’s not true,” Evans said about his rumored return at the time, explaining that these reports “happen every couple years” since he bowed out in “Endgame.”\n\n“I’ve just stopped responding to it,” he added. “Yeah, no — happily retired!”\n\nEvans isn’t the only original “Avengers” star who will be back for “Doomsday.” Robert Downey Jr. is returning, but not as Tony Stark. Instead, he is replacing his Iron Man armor to play the ultimate villain, Doctor Doom, in the multiverse-crossing movie. Other returning heroes include Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Mackie, Danny Ramirez, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Tom Hiddleston, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Simu Liu, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen and Lewis Pullman.

(Thus, one might’ve expected Cameron to slip a little Na’vi into the interview, not French.)\n\nBut no matter what language he speaks, the filmmaker makes it known he’s not keen to discuss the future of the franchise — at least, not until the box office returns have been counted.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“We’re getting ahead of ourselves because, first of all, we’ve got to make some money with this one,” Cameron says. “Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business case yet again.\n\n“The world has changed. We all know the stats, where theatrical is. It’s been a bad year,” he goes on. “It’s starting to perk up a little bit with a couple of recent releases: ‘Wicked: For Good’ has done well, and ‘Zootopia 2’ is doing well. So, we’ll see.”\n\nCameron is not being modest; he’s a pragmatist. His “Avatar” movies — about the adventures of Marine turned Na’vi leader Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), Na’vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their family — come with significant box office expectations. The original 2009 film and its 2022 sequel, “The Way of Water,” stand as two of the highest-grossing movies in history, with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. “Fire and Ash” earned a strong $345 million globally in its opening weekend, but that figure is down from “The Way of Water’s” $435 million start.\n\nAs Variety’s Rebecca Rubin explains in her box office analysis, Disney spent a massive $350 million to produce the threequel and roughly $150 million to promote it, meaning the big-budget blockbuster needs to deliver in terms of ticket sales for Cameron to move forward with his planned fourth and fifth installments. (For the record, “Avatar 4” is slated for Dec. 2029 and a significant portion of the film has already been shot, while “Avatar 5” is expected to debut Dec. 2031.)\n\nIn the meantime, “Avatar” super fans can also enjoy the making-of documentary, “Fire and Water,” where Cameron reveals how his groundbreaking performance capture process really works. Here, Cameron reflects on how the Disney+ documentary is changing the conversation around performance capture, particularly in the age of generative artificial intelligence, and more about making the new movie, like introducing Oona Chaplin’s villainous Varang and just how spicy her relationship with Quaritch (Stephen Lang) was intended to be.\n\nYou’ve said that you’re always a little nervous before these movies come out. Are you feeling a little better now?\n\nIt’s a good first step. People are responding well. I hadn’t seen it with a big audience before [the premiere], because we’ve done these small press screenings, and I don’t really go to those. There’s some laughs.\n\nDid any of those laughs surprise you?\n\nThe strength of a couple of them surprised me. And then there’s some applause too. There are moments that appear to be quite cathartic for the audience — some of the quieter, emotional stuff. For that, I just look at my wife, Suzy [Amis]; if she’s grabbing her tissues, then I know the scene’s working. It’s a little harder to read that in a big room.\n\nThe crowd applauded for Zoe Saldaña’s performance as Neytiri. You’ve described her work on the “Avatar” movies as “ferocious,” and since we last spoke, she’s won an Oscar [for “Emilia Pérez”]. Do you think pulling the curtain back on how performance capture technology works helps audiences appreciate her performance differently?\n\nThat’s a really great way to put it. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing. I’ve hidden the performance capture methodology because I thought, “I don’t want to see people in a performance capture suit. I want them to think that the characters are real.” Right? But it’s been such a disservice to these actors who are doing some of the best work in their careers. I’ve got Kate Winslet, Academy Award winner; Zoe Saldaña won an Academy Award last year; Sigourney Weaver, a highly respected actress, nominated multiple times. And I just think, “Why am I hiding this under a bushel here? I should be celebrating it.”\n\nJames Cameron (right) directing Zoe Saldaña and Sam Worthington on the set of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Mark Fellman\n\nWe just take all the cinematography — all the cameras and the lenses and the lighting and all that stuff — and we just shove it into the future. It’s like black box theater or a stage rehearsal. A lot of my cast have done theater, and they go, “Oh, this is like, standing up a play.” It’s that quiet, intimate exploration. Everybody said, “Well, how can they possibly do that without all the sets and all the wardrobe?” Well, actors live in their imagination, right? And we give them the things they need. Sigourney said, “I’d really like to have a shawl or something that I can kind of pull around myself and hide behind as this kind of sulky and misunderstood teenager.” It’s like, “Sure, no problem.” It’s a wonderful process. And as a writer-director who’s created these characters, handing that baton to the actors, and then seeing what they do with it, there’s nothing better.\n\nI learned that Sigourney, who plays Kiri, the Sullys’ adopted teenage daughter, actually narrates the next one.\n\nThat could be the case. We’re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nOona Chaplin’s character, Varang, who leads the Ash people, steals the show. But her relationship with Quaritch takes a sexier turn than some people might expect. There’s a mutual seduction, but did you ever consider showing a Na’vi sex scene?\n\nWe never really shot anything beyond what you see. Let’s put it that way. We knew what we were going for was an undercurrent of sensuality, and it’s a PG-13 movie as well.\n\nThe bigger question is, why did we spend 10 minutes — which is an eternity in screen time — not on our main characters, not on our protagonist characters? And the answer is very simple: Because it was cool. That’s my ultimate modus operandi. If it’s cool, we’re gonna explore it. And I’m very proud of that scene where he goes to her, and they go inside the tent, and they tussle over the power. It’s a fun scene.\n\nOona Chaplin as Varang in “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” 20TH CENTURY STUDIOS\n\nMuch like Zoe, this film is a showcase for Oona’s talent. Many people know her from “Game of Thrones” [Chaplin played Talisa Maegyr, Robb Stark’s ill-fated wife], but this is her big screen breakout moment.\n\nI didn’t know who Oona was when I cast her in 2016; I certainly hadn’t seen [“Game of Thrones.”]. But she had such a grasp of the character. Oona herself is just a very warm, beautiful, heartfelt person, almost the exact opposite [of Varang]. But isn’t that fun to play the opposite and find you have the ability to play that. It can be a little scary.\n\nThat’s that actor-director connection that you like to explore.\n\nIn an age of Gen AI chomping at the film industry, that’s another reason I’m pulling back the curtain to show that this is an actor-centric, artist-centric process, and we don’t use those tools. Historically, we haven’t used it at all.\n\nI’m curious about what it can do that’s done ethically and constructively. I don’t want to replace actors, even though people are stampeding to [saying,] “Oh, I can make a film in my mom’s basement, and I don’t need to pay any actors. How cool is that?”\n\nI’ve been mentoring some young filmmakers in New Zealand in a short film class, and I saw presentations for seven projects. All seven of them showed us their storyboards, their pre-viz, their music choices, their mood board, their character design. Not one of the presentations mentioned their cast. Afterwards, I said, “Guys, what the hell is going on here? You didn’t lead with your actors. Do you have actors?” [They said,] “Well, yeah.” And I said, “Why didn’t you lead with that?” I said, “You know what you all need to do when you get your films done? Go do some acting.” I think every director should do some acting. There’s a lot of acting in directing.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:19.742509"}

Fox is one of Hollywood’s most infamous re-castings, it turns out that decision led to a second firing. Hardin was originally cast as Marty’s girlfriend Jennifer Parker.\n\n“‘Back to the Future’ was a huge disappointment. I was 17, you know. I burst into tears,” Hardin told EW. “It was very sad. There were quite a few of those that I remember, you know, things that never really got made. But that I remember being very tough.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHardin revealed earlier this year that she also got the boot from “Back to the Future” when Stoltz was fired because studio executives thought she was too tall to star opposite Michael J. Fox. She explained: “It was apparently the two female executives at the time that thought that it was emasculating for their lead male character to be in scenes with a woman that was taller than him. If I had done it, I’m sure it would have all gone in a different way. I wouldn’t have done ‘The Office.'”\n\n“To be where I am, you have to have failed more than you’ve succeeded,” Hardin now told EW. “I think people don’t realize that when they look at it from the outside — you have to really be somebody who’s comfortable with failure, and with putting yourself on the line all the time. That failure doesn’t mean anything about you. You just have to fail better, and keep failing better … to be able to really weather this career choice.”\n\nStoltz and Hardin were in production for six weeks on “Back to the Future” when the decision was made to boot Stoltz and recast the lead role with the director’s first choice, Fox, who had originally been blocked from the film due to his commitment to the NBC sitcom “Family Ties.” Hardin was replaced by Claudia Wells. Fox revealed in his new memoir, “Future Boy,” that he wrote a letter to Stoltz asking to finally meet 40 years after the recasting.\n\n“Eric has maintained his silence on the subject for 40 years, so I was prepared for the likelihood that he’d prefer to keep it that way,” Fox writes in the memoir, noting the two had never come face to face to discuss the casting swap. Fox wrote to him: “If your answer is ‘piss off and leave me alone’… That works, too.”\n\nStoltz responded with a “beautifully written reply” that “began, ‘Piss off and leave me alone!’ Thankfully, this was followed by ‘I jest…’ Eric was thoughtful about my outreach, and although he respectfully declined to participate in the book, he seemed open to the idea of getting together.”\n\nWhen Fox and Stoltz finally found themselves together in the same room, the actors “immediately fell into an easy dialogue about our careers, families, and yes, our own trips through the space-time continuum,” Fox writes. “[Stoltz entered] with a smile, and we quickly acknowledged that neither of us had an issue with the other. What transpired on ‘Back to the Future’ had not made us enemies or fated rivals; we were just two dedicated actors who had poured equal amounts of energy into the same role. The rest had nothing to do with us. As it turned out, we had much more in common than our spin as Marty.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:06:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:19.981063"}

Tickets, according to the suit, “were massively discounted for patrons who identified as black, indigenous, or people of color.

It initially started out to be the studio’s desire to remake or “reimagine” their 1997 horror movie of the same name that starred Ice Cube, Jon Voight, and Jennifer Lopez among others and dealt with a National Geographic film crew hijacked by an insane hunter in his quest to bag an elusive giant snake. Studios naturally love to find a way to just repeat their successful IP and Anaconda was enough of a hit to think about a reboot all these years later. If Jumanji keeps working for Sony, why can’t this one also? And director Tom Gormican and his co-screenwriter Kevin Etten had a unique idea, quite an inspired one. Previously they had paired on the very funny 2022 comedy, The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent with Nicolas Cage playing a whacked out version of Nicolas Cage.\n\nSimilarly their pitch for this one was to turn it into a comedy vehicle, that also takes satirical shots at the movie business. Two down-on-their-luck guys come to a point in life where they team up to do a remake of their favorite movie as teenagers, Anaconda. Take a sharp premise for laughs and add in the first-ever teaming of Paul Rudd and Jack Black, and you have a recipe for a LOL good time at the movies. Comedy has been in short supply of late, and this one is sort of sneaking in at the end of a year where a traditional movie comedy is suddenly an endangered species. Naked Gun ably filled the bill over the summer, and I loved Aziz Ansari’s Good Forturne with Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves also in the cast, but that one sadly opened and closed this Fall without making much of an impression on audiences. There just aren’t that many comedies that aren’t also masquerading as something else. This one just wants to make you laugh. It does.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHere Gormican switches up the expected casting by making Black largely the straight man to Rudd’s crazier friend. Doug McCallister (Black) is a frustrated filmmaker stuck in a dead-end job as a wedding videographer, always wanting to sell his blockbuster tentpole ideas to the bride and groom who just only want the traditional treatment, not the blood and gore he has in mind. Ronald Griffin Jr, aka Griff (Rudd) is a failed actor with a few small credits, most notably a 4 episode arc on Swat, who gets fired from his latest job and then comes up with the idea to call Griff, get their school cameraman Kenny (Steve Zahn) and Griff’s ex-girlfriend Claire (Thandiwe Newton) back together to go to the Amazon and do a low budget remake of Anaconda, which through happenstance somehow Doug claims he has the remake rights.\n\nWith a reluctant Doug finally aboard after his wife Malie (Ione Skye) convinces him to live the dream, they all leave Buffalo for the snake infested waters of Brazil’s Amazon. After getting a boat and a captain, Ana (Daniela Melchior) the first order of duty is sign on a title star, and they get one, a professional huge anaconda named Heitor who comes with his trainer and best friend, a local named Santiago (Selton Mello). Though Heitor is claimed to be no more harmful than a puppy, there are some moments of fright for Griff who is a little uneasy acting opposite him and at one point panics and tosses him overboard resulting in Heitor’s gruesome demise. Santiago is distraught and wracked with grief while Doug and Griff now have to figure out how to replace their star with another snake to keep this production afloat. Well isn’t the Amazon full of these things? They will find one. Not a good idea when suddenly the real thing starts to eat everyone for dinner.\n\nWith Australia’s Queensland coast standing in the Amazon, Gormican skillfully milks all the inherent humor in the situation while also not letting the horror aspects of the original film overtake this one, at least not enough to threaten a PG13 rating. Thankfully he has this cast and a teaming of Rudd and Black who never go into Abbott & Costello territory with the premise but create likeable characters trying to find the spark of life and creative worth they once had in school. And although Black is largely playing it pretty straight he does have a killer signature scene involving a Wild Boar carcass attached to his back as bait for the real anaconda. Priceless Jack Black stuff.

It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions.\n\n\n\nTo commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood.\n\n\n\nAfter months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment.\n\n\n\nNotice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming.\n\n\n\nWe intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news.\n\n\n\nWhen you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line.\n\n\n\nAlso, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion.\n\n\n\nWe also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options.\n\n\n\nVariety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here.\n\n\n\nSpoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs.

Just a few weeks ago, she appeared in Rachel Sennott’s new comedy series, I Love LA, which has already been renewed for a second season. And now, the world is about to see her opposite Timothée Chalamet in Josh Safdie‘s much-anticipated A24 film Marty Supreme.\n\nSo, where did she come from? When we meet via Zoom, A’zion addresses this right away, saying, “It’s really funny, because I’m seeing a lot of these things online of people being like, ‘Odessa A’zion just came out of nowhere and she’s an industry plant.’ And I’m like, ‘I’ve been acting for 10 years now.’”\n\nVery early roles included an episode of her mom Pamela Adlon’s show Better Things, and in the past few years, A’zion has been in the Dakota Johnson-starrer Am I OK?, the comedy series Ghosts, and this year the films Pools and Until Dawn. It was this last she was shooting in Budapest when she found an old phone booth and used it to record a self-tape audition for Marty Supreme — a scene in which her character, Rachel Mizler, is in a 1950s-era phone booth negotiating with the owner of a dog Marty is holding for ransom (yes, you read that correctly).\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nRachel is crazy in love with Chalamet’s Marty Mauser — a ping pong king and hustler extraordinaire, loosely based on a real person named Marty Reisman. Ultimately, both Rachel and Marty will reveal a level of determination that leans towards the twisted. Here, A’zion reveals how she persevered through a long period of not booking anything, how a long-ago Euphoria audition led to the role of Rachel and how her acting style blended with Chalamet’s approach.\n\nDEADLINE: Last time we met it was at a panel onstage at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival and we talked about I Love LA.\n\nI think that was my first ever [on-stage Q&A]. That’s not true. I had done it once before, for Pools, but that felt like my first ever panel in front of a big audience like that.\n\nDEADLINE: Since then, you’ve been doing a lot of interviews. The last few months must have been very intense in the run-up to the Marty Supreme premiere. How are you coping with it?\n\nIt has definitely been crazy. It’s definitely a new thing I’d never experienced before. How am I coping with it? I’m learning the ways. I’m trying to get past anxieties of talking to big groups of people. That’s scary. I have stage fright, so that’s really hard. Which I know maybe just goes away with experience of getting on stage more, but I never wanted to get on stage in front of people because it’s scary as hell. But I’m just excited that people are getting to see the show and the movie and projects that I care so deeply about. So if that means me having to do that, then I’m happy to be a part of it.\n\nOdessa A’zion in ‘Marty Supreme’ A24\n\nDEADLINE: Tell me about the process of getting the role of Rachel in Marty Supreme? I know that you sent in some self-tapes you made in a Hungarian phone booth.\n\nI feel like for me personally, and when I first started acting and doing my own thing, I feel like I didn’t book anything for a really long time, I don’t know. It took a really long time for me to book something. And it really didn’t happen until I started making my tapes my own and dressing as the character, what I thought the character would look like, versus people telling me, “Just wear neutral colors, go with a blank background.” And when I first started, it was in person too anyway, so it was whatever background they had. But self-tapes, I feel like are so special because you really have an opportunity to make it your own and make it as realistic as you want to make it. And if I didn’t find a phone booth, I was going to find a way to find a phone booth.\n\nI sent the tape a sh-t-ton of times, a bunch of different tapes over the course of a couple days. And I memorized that faster than I’ve ever memorized anything in my life.\n\nDEADLINE: Because the audition was the scene where Rachel’s in the phone booth in the movie…\n\nYeah. Which I think is way worse in the movie than my audition was. But yeah, it was a tape that had come about. I had met with Josh beforehand and Jennifer [Venditti, casting director] remembered me from my audition for Euphoria years ago and thought that I was right for this role, and was trying to tell Josh that she felt that she found his Rachel. And at first, when I met with him, he thought I was maybe too young and it didn’t go my way. And then a couple months later, it came back around and I was able to send the tape. I sent an improv portion, I sent an interview portion. And I mean, I sent the tape a sh-t-ton of times, a bunch of different tapes over the course of a couple days. And I memorized that faster than I’ve ever memorized anything in my life because I never will do a tape not memorized, like holding the paper. I feel it’s so important to show that you really took time and care about it. But yeah, after that, Jen and Josh Fac-Timed me. Josh was showing me around the stadium because the movie used to have a different ending and they were scouting for the stadium for the ending. And he was like, “This is where we’re going to shoot this. And this is where we shoot this. And this is Jack Fisk, he’s doing the set design.” I’m [thinking], what the f–k is going on? Did I get the part or are you just like, dangling it? And then he told me that I got the part. It was so crazy.\n\nDEADLINE: Did you have the full script? Did you know about the different ending at the time?\n\nI had the script with the original ending before it was changed a couple different times, and then a couple things just had to be cut timing-wise in the movie because otherwise it would’ve been an even longer movie. I feel like they got it to a really good time.\n\nTimothée Chalamet in ‘Marty Supreme’ A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nDEADLINE: Did you do chemistry reads with Timothée before you got the role? Obviously your characters have this intense connection.\n\nNo, no. Nothing. Personally, I feel like Josh, I think he’s got a really good read on actors — a really, really good read. And I think he could just tell if someone will work with someone else beforehand. I think if he has an intuition on someone or something, he’s going to go with it, no matter what. Even if maybe they don’t have chemistry in person or something, I think he can see his vision.\n\nDEADLINE: So, then what was your first interaction with Timothée? Did you just go right into shooting?\n\nJosh thought that it would be a good idea to have us go and have breakfast together somewhere. Or maybe it was dinner. Me, Josh, and Timmy at this little diner in New York. And so, we just hung there for a little bit, and all talked before we started things. I was so excited to start that movie. That movie just is so special for so many reasons. I was kind of feeling at a time where I know I want to do acting with my life… I was just talking to my agent and friend a couple days before I got the tape and I’m like, “Dude, I love working. I love doing these horror movies and I love doing these Indies.” But I’m just like, “I don’t know if I’m going to ever have a career more than this.” And then… This is the first time I’m in something of this scale and this character. I’ve been thinking about that so much. I feel so lucky that I was able to be a part of it. And I feel like Rachel came at such an important time in my life too, just mentally, because I felt like she came when I really needed her. I don’t know, not to get emotional… It was just a hard, hard year, a lot of loss, a lot of people lost and you can’t do anything about that. Once people are gone, they’re gone. So this whole thing felt really, really special and kismet and from the angels, kind of. She’s just such a special character to me.\n\nPenn Jillette, Kevin O’Leary, Timothée Chalamet, Odessa A’zion, Tyler, The Creator, Gwyneth Paltrow and Koto Kawaguchi at the ‘Marty Supreme’ LA Premiere\n\nDEADLINE: What do you think of Rachel? She’s scrappy. She’ll do what it takes to get out of a situation.\n\nShe, in a way, feels like a mixture of inner child and chaos and freedom, while also being really, really strong, secure adult. She’s so confident in what she wants and what she believes she deserves for herself. I wish I had that confidence and to defend yourself and stand up for yourself. And I just think she’s just a really layered, really beautiful strong, character… I just think she’s so stuck in this world. I mean, you look at 1952 and her situation and her husband and being pregnant with the other guy’s baby, but she really wants to be with the other guy, because they’ve loved each other their whole lives. And she’s just so stuck. She’s just restrained by this societal pressure to settle down and get married and do it fast, when she knew that she wanted to be with this other person. And so she takes it into her own hands. She says, “OK, if he doesn’t want to be with me this way, I’m going to show him.” I really, really admire her.\n\nI’m going to go home and watch Hitchcock because I know that those are the movies that were going around at that time. And I’m going to chop my hair off for the role and strip the color out to make her feel younger.\n\nDEADLINE: I interviewed Timmy for A Complete Unknown last year, and one of the things we talked about was how much he immersed himself in this role for Marty Supreme. Tell me about your impressions of working with him, the way he works, and the way your styles fit together as actors.\n\nSo, I think in ways we’re very similar and in ways we’re very different. We’re very similar in ways of we just want it to be as authentic as it possibly can be, which means for me, less rehearsal. Let’s just go in and do it and feel it out and feel what comes. And if there’s something that one of us is stuck on, let’s talk about it. We can easily talk about it. There’s not one of us saying, “I don’t want to talk about it.” It’s fully open, flowy. If one of us feels stuck, we’re there.\n\nBut then [we’re] different in the other sense of he really immerses himself in the character in that way — I don’t really know because I haven’t really talked to him about it, so I cannot speak on his behalf, but from what I’ve witnessed. Versus for me, I immerse myself in the character in just a different way where I’m going to go home and watch Hitchcock because I know that those are the movies that were going around at that time. And I’m going to chop my hair off for the role and strip the color out to make her feel younger. Josh liked my natural color better, and I’m going to make my hair super frizzy so that I’m extra Jewish for the role because that’s what that character was. And I’m going to put the weights on my belly so that I could really feel like I’m pregnant. I’m going to make the playlists so that I have the Rachel playlist of what I think that she was listening to then. And then just a playlist of what I feel about Rachel and Marty’s love. So, I immerse myself in a different way than Timmy immerses himself. I think he needs to be locked into the character in just a different way, but we work with each other really, really well. And I loved working with him and he’s just so incredible. He’s such an amazing actor.\n\nRachel Sennott and Odessa A’zion in ‘I Love LA’ HBO\n\nDEADLINE: Do you feel ready for everyone to see the film when it premieres in a couple days?\n\nI don’t know. I’m a little scared. I’m really, really excited for people to see the movie. I’m really excited for people to see the movie because it’s just such an incredible movie, and these filmmakers, they really have a vision. And I’m so grateful to have been a part in it, in even the tiniest way. It happened really fast. I feel like we just finished filming and boom, now it’s coming out.\n\nDEADLINE: And what are you most excited about making Season 2 of I Love LA?\n\nI’m just excited to go back with all the cast. And the character’s very different for me. We talk different, we walk different. I feel like we look a little different. So that’s always really weird for me, but it’s really fun to do with the cast and to be able to shoot at home because I’m from LA, I live in LA. It’s the best. I’m super excited to go back.\n\nMarty Supreme is in theaters from December 25th.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:46:52 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:39.745461"}

He was 68.\n\nArkadie was born on Dec. 10, 1957. He grew up in Maryland and received his BFA in acting from Southern Methodist University in Dallas before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in entertainment. He secured his first job as a staff writer on the NBC drama series “I’ll Fly Away.”\n\nHe subsequently created “New York Undercover” with Wolf in 1994. The series, which starred Malik Yoba and Michael DeLorenzo as undercover NYPD officers, was the first American cop drama to feature two people of color as the leads. It ran on Fox for four seasons before going off the air in 1999.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDuring and after “New York Undercover,” Arkadie produced “Chicago Hope” on CBS, “NYPD Blue” on ABC and “The Shield” on FX, among other series. He also continued to write, penning episodes of the NBC miniseries “The Temptations” and serving as showrunner on BET’s “Sacrifice” for two seasons.

We remain grateful for his contributions, and he will be deeply missed and always remembered.\n\nLamar also released a statement, calling Arkadie “a consummate professional, true collaborator, and astute researcher” while Arkadie’s cousin and fellow producer L True Green called him “one of America’s greatest storytellers” in a Facebook post.\n\nArkadie is survived by his wife and family.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:21:16 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:21.066953"}

How ‘The Ugly Stepsister’ Make-Up Team Recreated ‘Cinderella’ as a Body Horror", "link": "https://variety.com/2025/artisans/news/ugly-stepsister-body-horror-cinderella-1236616590/", "summary": "Norwegian director Emilie Blichfeldt&#8217;s feature debut &#8220;The Ugly Stepsister&#8221; takes inspiration from an unlikely pair of genres: Disney fairy tales and Italian Giallo films.

The movie, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and was acquired by Shudder, reimagines “Cinderella” as a body horror film from the empathetic perspective of the titular, vilified sibling, Elvira (Lea Myren). As Elvira prepares for the prince’s royal ball, she undergoes body transformations large and small to try conforming to society’s highest beauty standards.\n\n“The most important thing was to make just a normal, cute teenager who is just really in love with this prince,” explains the movie’s makeup designer Anne Cathrine Sauerberg, “and to show what people do to themselves.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nJust the initial effect of making the 24-year-old Myren look like a teenager was a feat for the prosthetic and makeup departments. “She was wearing cheeks and a nose and has a fake neck that actually stops in the middle of the neck,” says prosthetic makeup designer and special effects artist Thomas Foldberg. “We didn’t want her neck to be too broad. We wanted to erase the collarbone and some of the neck muscles. We wanted to make her softer without exaggerating, so it had to be kept really tight and really subtle.”\n\nAt first, Elvira’s transformations are indeed subtle. At the behest of her mother, Rebekka (Ane Dahl Torp), Elvira undergoes a cosmetic nose realignment, executed in the archaic medical practices of the film’s 19th-century setting. The doctor (Adam Lundgren) intentionally fractures Elvira’s nose and she wears a face brace for much of the first act, removing it once to reveal a partially healed, misshapen ridge and later removing it again to reveal a much more conventional nose. Because Foldberg and Sauerberg had Myren in a prosthetic nose from the beginning, they were able to adjust it accordingly to create the subtle change.\n\nThe subtlety decreases as Elvira further modifies her body in anticipation of the ball. Once her nose is in place, Elvira gets an eyelash transplant whereby the same doctor threads fake lashes through her lower eyelid. The camera captures the procedure in an extreme close-up of Elvira’s eye and reverse shots from Elvira’s horrifying perspective.\n\nTo achieve the realistic look of the extreme close-up, Foldberg opted for a blend of practical and digital effects. He collaborated with visual effects supervisor Peter Hjort to composite the actor’s actual eye onto a dummy head. “We did the whole scene with the actress and then we did it with the fake head, which I was actually stitching into, and everything was put together afterwards” Foldberg explains. “It’s basically half a dummy head from the eyelids below and then the other part is the actor herself.”\n\nThe film’s most gruesome scene, however, comes after the ball and is ripped straight from the pages of the original “Cinderella” folk tale. In an effort to fit into the slipper that her stepsister Agnes (Thea Sofie Loch Næss) left at the ball, Elvira severs the toes from her right foot. In a series of sanguinary close-ups, Elvira takes a cleaver to her digits, first slicing them and then fully dismembering them.\n\n“It was extremely complicated to do the slit where the blood is kind of beating out,” explains Foldberg. “That was one big prosthetic foot and then we had two fake legs that went from under her knees and below. We had this blood rigged leg for the initial chopping off of the toes and then it had some small attachments.”\n\nAfter Elvira cuts off her toes and is bleeding out, Rebekka finds her and realizes that she severed the wrong foot for the slipper. Obsessively, Rebekka recreates the wound on Elvira’s left foot, this time captured in a wide shot that shows the foot and leg attached to Elvira’s body. “The real leg was hidden under her dress,” says Foldberg of the shot. “It’s just bent and then the prosthetic leg goes from the knee and down.”\n\nDespite her pathological efforts, Elvira fails to win over the prince and in the final sequence, she crawls about on her broken feet, her hair thinning and teeth chipped from the trauma she’s put herself through.\n\nMuch of that trauma stems from a tapeworm egg that Elvira consumes to lose weight at the beginning of her transformation. By the end, the worm is fully grown, several feet long, and Elvira’s sister, Alma (Flo Fagerli) must help her remove it in a gristly game of tug of war. To achieve the effect of Alma extracting the worm from Elvira’s mouth, Foldberg and his team created several silicone worm pieces and then fed them through a contraption attached to the side of Myren’s face. The contraption was composited out in post-production to make it look like the worm is expelled from the depths of Elvira’s throat. “We also had a puppet head of her from the nose down,” says Foldberg. “Where you could push big chunks of this worm and slime out of her.”\n\nThe film as a whole used minimal CGI and instead went for practical effects paired with compositing, creating a raw and seamless look throughout. This ingenuity paid off, as “The Ugly Stepsister” is now shortlisted for Best Makeup & Hairstyling at the upcoming 98th Academy Awards. It is Shudder’s first shortlisted film in the category.\n\nFor the film’s success, Sauerberg and Foldberg credit Blichfeldt. “She was so well prepared and had so many ideas,” says Foldberg. “I was really, really blown away by her knowledge of genre films and she had really a specific vision for this project.”\n\n“We all know Cinderella’s story so well, so we all have different pictures of how it should look like, and [Blichfeldt’s] vision was just so extremely clear,” adds Sauerberg. “It was so easy to connect with her and her visions and align them with my own visions.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:16:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:21.481439"}

The film, which opens in theaters on Dec. 24 via Independent Film Company, is an unconventional horror tale about a young boy named Ben (Everett Blunck), who is new to the social structure of an all-boys water polo camp. Other children, under the direction of their cruel peer Jake (Kayo Martin) and with very little adult supervision, alienate shy young Eli (Kenny Rasmussen) by saying he has the titular disease. Things get uncomfortable from there.\n\nThe casual viciousness of children is the centerpiece of the film, which has triggered audiences who grew up in the same era as Polinger. After he directed a 2018 short film named “Sauna” with similar themes, he caught COVID and was quarantined in his childhood bedroom. While there, Polinger went through his journals and was reminded of the genesis of the “Plague” game and the memories of people he hadn’t thought about in ages.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I’ve been surprised every step of the way, even just how cross-generational and cross-cultural that sentiment of youth seems to be,” he says. “I had that experience looking at these journals, where it was a sensory portal bringing me back to a time that I had really buried. It was very intense and visceral and overwhelming. I think that the movie has that effect on other people, where it’s like that smell, that candle that brings you back to certain times in life. That takes you on your own journey, and anyone might apply something personal to the movie. People come up to me after screenings and talk to me about their experiences, very personal stories.”\n\nAlthough the film is a period piece set a few decades ago without cellphones, it’s being released at a time when the country is run by President Trump, who frequently uses bullying to set the national tone. Polinger says that although his film is informed by specificity, it can speak broadly to many different cultural touchpoints.\n\n“My feeling about films in general is, when you’re making something that feels as honest as possible and personal, those things usually apply in larger political ways,” he says. “I think there are dynamics of how bullying works, but also how social hierarchies are developed, and myths are made. ‘The Plague’ is kind of a myth. In the beginning, it’s clearly a very dumb game and a dumb joke, and it’s not taken very seriously. But because everyone else chooses to take it seriously, because everyone else is doing it, it starts to become something increasingly real because the collective has made it so.\n\n“Jake, as a ringleader, will look at you like you’re crazy if you don’t take it seriously,” Polinger continues. “You want to fit in with Jake because it’s too scary not to have his approval, because he’s so charismatic, and he’s bonding with everyone else by making fun of the outcast. So you don’t want to be that person. You play the rules of the game, and suddenly they become crystallized. I think that paradigm applies to bigger social structures, political things … in general, authoritarianism. There are cycles of this throughout history that are built around the same human instincts that, hopefully, this film is exploring through a more personal lens.”\n\nAfter “The Plague,” Polinger is set to adapt a high-profile property, helming a feature-length version of Edgar Allan Poe’s short story “The Masque of the Red Death,” starring Oscar winner Mikey Madison. Polinger is excited to start filming his unique vision of the classic text.\n\n“It’s definitely inspired by the short story, but it goes into a completely new story,” he says. “So it’s a very bombastic, irreverent, dark comedic tale, set in this medieval, slightly fantastical world. It’s not a modernized version of it at all. It’s high energy, it’s out there and very different in many ways on the surface from ‘The Plague,’ but also exploring claustrophobic group dynamics — just from a very different genre and tone.”\n\nWatch the trailer for “The Plague” below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.054550"}

Now, less than a month after Season 5 Volume 1 and days ahead of Volume 2, Netflix reports that the entirety of “Stranger Things” has crossed 1.2 billion views in total.\n\nThat statistic, calculated by dividing the total amount of time the series has ever been streamed by the combined runtime of all available episodes, puts “Stranger Things” as a whole above any series in Netflix history — even “Wednesday” and “Squid Game,” which are the only projects with individual seasons that rank above “Stranger Things” Season 4. Released in 2023, Season 4 remains at No. 2 on Netflix’s list of its most popular English-language TV title of all time. Season 3, which is more than six years old now, only recently fell off that chart.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAs such, the most-rewatched scenes in the show’s history came in those seasons: No. 1 is the scene in Season 4 Episode 7 when Nancy (Natalia Dyer) falls into a trance while being possessed by Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), followed by the Season 3 Episode 8 scene when Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Suzie (Gabriella Pizzolo) sing the “NeverEnding Story” theme song together.\n\nIn just 25 days, Volume 1 of Season 5 has reached 102.6 million views. It’s all but guaranteed that Season 5 will make the all-time viewership chart next month; if it was eligible now, before its final episode have been released, it would already rank at No. 9, between “Bridgerton” Season 3 (2024) and “The Night Agent” Season 1 (2023). Plus, Netflix measures its all-time chart ending 91 days after each title’s final episodes are released, meaning Season 5 will continue accruing views until three months after the New Year’s Eve finale. The season has a solid shot to make it to No. 1 during the first quarter of 2026.\n\nIn addition, “Stranger Things” Season 5 has ranked as the most-watched title of the week in 90 of the 93 countries Netflix tracks while also directing viewers back to previous seasons. “Stranger Things” became the first Netflix series to have four seasons in the Top 10 at once, then the first to chart with five seasons — and all five seasons remain on the chart even now, four weeks since Season 5 debuted. And since the advent of the Netflix Top 10 in 2021, the series’ five seasons have made the global Netflix Top 10 a combined 78 times. All 93 countries tracked have seen on “Stranger Things” on their individual Top 10 lists at one point or another.\n\nStill, the reach of “Stranger Things” expands beyond Netflix views.\n\nThe show made headline after headline for its use of “Running Up That Hill” in Season 4. 38 years after the song was released, “Stranger Things” helped earn Kate Bush her first-ever Top 10 hit in the U.S. Additionally, Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” (1986) made the U.K. Top 10 for the first time after being used in the season.\n\nWith Season 5, that effect has been replicated again and again. According to Spotify, several oldies have seen major streaming boosts since their use in Volume 1. Among Gen Z, Diana Ross’ “Upside Down” (1980) saw an increase in streams of 1,250% and Tiffany’s “I Think We’re Alone Now” (1987) jumped by 880%. Across all demographics, streams have risen for The Chordettes’ “Mr. Sandman” (1954) by 625% and for ABBA’s “Fernando” (1976) by 335%, with the latter getting a 645% boost with Gen Z. The music streamer also reports that users have created 205,000 “Stranger Things”-themed playlists since Season 1 debuted in 2016.\n\nEggo, the frozen waffle brand that has existed since 1956, enjoyed renewed interest after being prominently featured in “Stranger Things” as the favorite snack of Millie Bobby Brown’s character, Eleven. Parent company Kellogg’s reported 14% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, which followed the release of Season 2, and 9.4% growth in the first four months of 2018.\n\nNetflix also boasts that interest in “Dungeons & Dragons” has grown by 673% since the 2016 debut of “Stranger Things,” which constantly references the table-top role-playing game — though it must be noted that the “Dungeons & Dragons” universe has made many big strides of its own over the last nine years, including expansions to the game itself, a 2023 feature film and more. Still, its rise — which also includes sales increases of 96% in both 2017 and 2018 — was still heavily impacted by “Stranger Things,” and the show and game have released multiple official collaborations.\n\nThe show also drove a collaboration between Netflix and Nabisco, with the snack company releasing limited-edition “Stranger Things” Chip’s Ahoy cookies ahead of Season 5. The campaign around the cookies reached 11 billion impressions.\n\nNaturally, the series has been a massive boon to the business of content. Since 2016, “Stranger Things” has created more than 8,000 production jobs in the U.S. and contributed $1.4 billion to the national GDP.\n\nThat impact has been strongest in Georgia, where most of the series was filmed, with $650 million contributed to the state GDP and more than 2,000 vendors involved in production. Next in line was California, with $500 million contributed to the state GDP.\n\n“Stranger Things” has also spawned a universe of its own, even before on-screen spinoffs have been released. In the U.S. alone, “Stranger Things” books, comics and other publishing projects have crossed 3.1 million sales since Season 1. “Stranger Things: The Experience,” a live event that was first produced in 2022, has led to 850,000 ticket sales across cities including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, London, Paris, Brazil and Australia. Other live events around the globe, pegged to Season 5 specifically, have attracted more than 300,000 fans across 32 cities and 23 countries, with highlights including the “One Last Ride” cycling event in Los Angeles (50,000 fans) and a parade in São Paulo (13,000). There are still more events to come in London, Bangkok, Milan, Las Vegas and Madrid as 2025 concludes.\n\nAnd in an unprecedented move especially for Netflix, the series finale on New Year’s Eve will be played in movie theaters in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n“Stranger Things: The First Shadow” a play that serves as a prequel to the TV series, debuted in London’s West End in 2023, with a Broadway transfer opening earlier this year. The play won four Tony Awards in the U.S. plus two Olivier Awards and Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards in the U.K. — adding to the 70 awards and 230 nominations the TV series has earned to date, which includes 12 Emmy wins.\n\nAnd when looking at the career trajectories of the young cast of “Stranger Things,” the series can be looked at as a Disney Channel-like talent pipeline, generating celebrities out of tweens who were relatively unknown beforehand. Brown has become Netflix royalty, leading the films “The Electric State” and “Damsel” — the latter being the streamer’s No. 10 most popular English-language movie of all time, plus the “Enola Holmes” franchise, which has a third film premiering in 2026.\n\nSocial media is another good measure of the cast’s rise. Netflix’s earliest tracked Instagram follower count for Brown — which came before “Stranger Things Season 1 debuted but potentially after trailers and marketing had been released — was 2.1 million, and she now has more than 68 million. Sadie Sink, who plays Max, has the next-highest following with 26.8 million, up from 1.1 million before her debut in Season 2. Other following increases include 6,400 to 23 million for Finn Wolfhard; 10,000 to 23.4 million for Noah Schnapp; 18,000 to to 13 million for Caleb McLaughlin; and 20,000 to 17 million for Matarazzo. New Season 5 stars Jake Connelly and Nell Fisher have seen increases from 12,000 to 582,000 and 30,000 to 875,000, respectively.\n\nAlso on social, the pre-launch marketing campaign for “Stranger Things” Season 5 was Netflix’s biggest ever with 5.8 billion impressions. The concurrent rewatch campaign for previous seasons generated 1.3 billion impressions, and “Stranger Things: The Experience” has achieved 2 billion social impressions to date. Even the show’s Easter eggs have gone viral; the subtle inclusion of a “Missing Teen” hotline for Eleven in Season 5 went viral online and resulted in more than 1 million calls.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.324121"}

Netflix has, of course, thrown its weight behind a hefty marketing campaign for Emily in Paris Season 5, which included a press preview aboard a Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train for a 24-hour journey from Venice to Paris. The stunt also offered press interactions with lead cast including Lily Collins and Ashley Park during tea service, Aperitivo Hour, a three-course dinner, and late-night afterparty.

The first four episodes alone have now generated 102.6M views globally to date, just ahead of the Vol. 2 release on Christmas Day. The season came in fourth place on the weekly TV list, but it’s expected to shoot right back up to first place next week thanks to those three new episodes.\n\nAnd, in fact, that already makes it one of Netflix’s most-watched seasons of television ever, soaring right past The Night Agent and Fool Me Once on the English-language most popular list.

So, now the only question is how high it will go.\n\nAll four previous seasons were once again in the Top 10 as well: Season 1 at No. 8 (3.5 million views), Season 2 at No. 10 (3.3 million views), Season 3 at No. 7 (3.6 million views), and Season 4 at No. 6 (3.9 million views)\n\nThe actual biggest title of the week was a Korean disaster film called The Great Flood with 27.9M views, while Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery took No. 1 on the English film list with 20.9M views.\n\nSurprise, surprise, Kpop Demon Hunters came in third with 7.9M views and has now surpassed 500M views since premiere.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:27:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.758364"}

It has made a couple of theatrical runs (including a sing-along version) that has grossed $24.6 million. On the awards front, the pic has Best Animated Film noms from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, and it was voted the year’s best in that category from the New York Film Critics Circle. Its soundtrack snagged five Grammy nominations behind the smash hit “Golden,” which also made the Oscar Original Song shortlist.\n\nA sequel is in the works eyeing a 2029 release.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nKPop Demon Hunters’ narrative centers on their battle against the Saja Boys, a rival boy band whose members are secretly demons serving the villain Gwi-Ma, a flaming, all-consuming mouth inspired by Korean mythology.\n\nThe story, which originated from Kang, is anchored by the internal struggle of the group’s leader, Rumi, voiced by Arden Cho, who harbors the secret that she is half-demon. Trained to believe that all demons are inherently evil, Rumi lives in fear that her bandmates will destroy her if they discover the golden patterns hidden beneath her skin. This personal conflict serves as a central theme, illustrating the battle between one’s public persona and their inner demons — the negative, nagging voices of self-doubt that the filmmakers represent through literal supernatural forces.\n\nBeyond the action, the film explores the nuances of cultural belonging through the character of Zoey, a Korean-American maknae who overcompensates for her fear of not being “Korean enough” as a Korean. Kang, who drew from her own heritage and childhood love of Korean mythology, emphasized that the film is rooted in the tradition of female shaman warriors who used music and dance to connect communities.\n\nUltimately, Kpop Demon Hunters explores how music and human empathy create a literal shield, known as the Golden Honmoon, against the darkness. The filmmakers aimed to show that while inner demons may never fully disappear, individuals can find power in their “true voices” and integrate the fractured parts of their identities rather than hiding them. Employing the blend of K-pop and ancient mythology, the film seeks to tell a universal story about the strength found in vulnerability and communal connection.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:12:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.971480"}

Miller’s wife Cami, played by Demi Moore, has stepped up to run M-Tex Oil, while Andy Garcia’s cartel boss Danny ‘Gallino’ Morrell is getting more involved in the oil business every day.\n\nThen there’s the Norris family; Ali Larter’s Angela is still giving Tommy grief, particularly at dinner, his son Cooper, played by Jacob Lofland, has found his own oil but is also now in business with the cartel, and his daughter Ainsley is getting ready to cheer at Texas Christian University. His father T.L, played by Sam Elliott, is also now in the picture and in the house, and is dealing with his own grief, following the death of his wife and Tommy’s mother.\n\nThe ten-part Paramount+ series, which was created by Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace, and is loosely based on the latter’s Boomtown podcast, runs through January 18. It has been renewed for season three.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nMoore, Elliott, Garcia and Larter sat down with Deadline after a screening of episodes five and six at the Pacific Design Center in LA to discuss the show and their characters.\n\nMoore joked that the first season of the show – where Cami is infrequently shown swimming laps in the pool – was like Where’s Waldo? for her. Season two felt like her first season.\n\n“To Taylor’s credit, this was all very intentional. He’s so smart about really creating the unexpected. No one would ever have thought if you had Jon Hamm that you would be letting him go,” she said. “This was my first chance to really step into the world. I was certainly not the light part of the of the show, dealing, obviously, with tremendous grief. For Cami, I always felt that losing the company would be losing the last piece of Monty that she has, and that it would be an ultimate failure,” Moore said.\n\nDemi Moore as Cami Miller in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nCami is thrown in at the deep end, having to deal with Monty’s financial peculiarities, while keeping the oil rigs pumping. Moore said working with Thornton on those nuances was a lot of fun. “[Tommy] is her lifeline and yet to go against the only anchor that she has – trusting her own instincts – led to a lot of juicy, spicy moments,” she added.\n\nMoore met a number of women that were in a similar situation to Cami. “Taylor and his wife Nicole [Muirbrook] set up a whole gathering with a group of ten women. These women have empowered femininity, they are extremely strong and fierce. It really gave me incredible insight into who he was looking for Cami to be.”\n\nLandman marked The Substance star’s first lead series role. “I had watched almost everything that Taylor had ever done, and I was so impressed with how he wrote his female characters. For a straight white man, that was really even more impressive, because they were so nuanced,” she added.\n\nLandman was Elliott’s second rodeo with Sheridan, having starred in 1883. Elliott had previously called the Yellowstone prequel role a “gift”. “I feel the same way about [Landman]. An opportunity to come and work with this cast and do Taylor’s words again with this crew… it’s just as good as it gets,” he said.\n\nSam Elliott and Billy Bob Thornton in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nThe Tombstone star’s character is dealing with the death of his wife, while figuring out his strained relationship with his son, a relationship that becomes more pronounced when he moves in with the family. Elliott enjoyed the back-and-forth with Thornton. “He’s a one of a kind guy, there’s no doubt about it. He’s a gift to all of us, I know that the company feels that way about him. He’s a lot of fun to work with. He comes ready,” he added.\n\nIt’s not clear how things are progressing between the landman and his corn dog-eating father, particularly after a contentious funeral dinner. “I’m new to the show for one thing, and I don’t really know where I’m headed,” Elliott joked.\n\nBut his character is still enjoying watching the spectacular West Texas sunsets, even if Elliott was staring at lights. “Texas really does have beautiful sunsets. That whole thing about talking about the heat and the lack of moisture in the air and the dust, it’s very true. That’s another thing about Taylor, he knows what he writes about. That’s what makes it fun for me,” he said.\n\nAli Larter as Angela Norris in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nT.L is invited to live with the Norris family by Angela, played by Larter, and he is soon roped into the fun of her themed-dinners, including this season a pirate dinner (which followed an incident with a $2800 mushroom at a previous dinner).\n\nLarter says throwing cacio e pepe at Thornton’s character was “very fun”. “You can just feel the connectivity that has happened this season, and especially with Sam being part of the cast now, and the depth of moments that he brings to the pirate dinner. There’s Ainsley and Angela up to their shenanigans, and then we get to look over and have Sam Elliott just looking at you, and it just brings a different moment to these scenes,” she said.\n\nAngela spends much of season two with Randolph’s Ainsley, helping some senior citizens get drunk and have fun, while they’re meant to be exercising. Angela’s relationship with Tommy is also unfolding.\n\n“It’s incredible coming back for a second season to begin with, because the first season we built our house and you spend a tremendous amount of time figuring out the dynamics of the family, the chemistry that everyone has,” she said. “Once the show is up and running, we’re kind of like a train barreling forward. So, when we came back this year, it was exciting to kind of look at where this relationship was going. It’s just like a complicated, messy relationship, and sometimes we’re laughing and sometimes we’re fighting, and it’s all in there. It’s all very alive, but it’s these two people really questioning if it’s possible for them to make this work, or if this is just kind of a pipe dream.”\n\nAngela also inadvertently gets Tommy to spend more time with Andy Garcia’s character, known only as Gallino when he turns up in the season one finale as a cartel boss saving Tommy.\n\nHe is now Danny Morrell, an investment banker with fingers in a lot of pies. “He has this kind of duality of life, he’s like Bruce Wayne and Batman,” said Garcia.\n\nAndy Garcia and Billy Bob Thornton in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nGarcia, who also compares Gallino to a member of the Corleone family, said that he told Thornton that he believes there’s some trouble ahead for the pair. “He’s going to slip in a spontaneous moment back to that other world. I [told Billy] that his character just happens to be with him when that goes down and he’s gonna hand him a gun and you’re going to have to step in it with me,” he added.\n\n“He’s an investment banker. He’s managing money for a lot of people. He’s managing the syndicate of the horses. He’s got his fingers everywhere. He has to be somebody that is able to navigate that with with a sense of purpose, a sense of class, a sense of people could have to trust him with their money and he has to be successful what he does.

The story, packed to the brim with 15 playable iconic characters, retells the events of the Marvel Comics crossover special of 2006’s Annihilation, which sees the galactic big bad Annihilus wage war amongst the cosmos through a series of mass invasions in hopes of one day ruling it all.\n\nSince its early December launch, Cosmic Invasion has been praised for combining lesser-known Marvel characters and properties with the more popular heroes that have launched a series of IP juggernauts in the MCU and beyond, making the story both casual fan-friendly and surprising for those who worship at the altar of true Marvel fandom. The game has also managed to set itself apart from other side-scrolling brawlers in its Cosmic Swap mechanic, which sees the player choose two characters when they start the game, allowing them to make a swap out any time during a fierce battle against Annihilus’ evil honchos.\n\nBelow, game director Frederic Gemus and Narrative Designer Yannick Belzil speak to Deadline about the inspiration behind the game, character designs and what players can expect next.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDEADLINE: I enjoyed seeing nuanced animations within these level designs of Destromundo, Fort Galactus and Savage Lands. I’m curious, what was the trickiest level design in general?\n\nFREDERIC GEMUS: The trickiest aspect was pretty much trying to figure out where we wanted to go because we’re big fans of the Marvel universe. So, figuring out which environments would be nice to visit and would also help build a story was a challenge. We tried to strike a mix of expected locales for the players and fresh, new places. And obviously, as a game director, one aspect that was important for me was making sure that all of these locations could have interesting gameplay aspects. You mentioned Destromundo, which has Lady Hellbender’s collection of critters from all across the universe. And for us, it was basically a cameo festival of what we can see in the background, but also what kind of surprises can occur from these giant creatures, like how they can interact with the players and reshuffle the battlefield.\n\nIt’s the same thing with Fort Galactus. We wanted to have this idea that we’re climbing toward liberating Galactus, but also, we wanted to have a stage in which we would have multiple encounters with the boss, in this case, the Silver Surfer. So, the whole feeling of fighting against the barricades of enemies with turrets, climbing elevators, and multiple fight sequences, all of these locations we wanted to translate into unique gameplays that would make the experience varied. That way, you get unique experiences so that Fort Galactus feels completely different from Wakanda, which is in the middle of an invasion, and there are a lot of things happening – you ride a train, you fight the claw. We wanted to maximize the gameplay we could get from each stage and then work with Yannick to ensure the adventure remained interesting.\n\nYANNICK BELZIL: When we chose these locales, we wanted to choose environments that felt like classic Marvel Comics locales that people would recognize and could associate with certain characters as well. For example, the first level is classic New York City, which you have in a lot of the Marvel Comics, and there’s a lot of the Daily Bugle stuff tied into Spider-Man. But when you’re in Genosha, you have an X-Men team level where you can fill Sentinels with it. Then you have Wakanda for Black Panther, and you have the Helicarrier for Shield, but that’s also in the lineage of Iron Man and Captain America. Then there’s the Blue Area of the Moon, which is a human settlement and also a classic location for several characters – especially Dark Phoenix.\n\nSo, for me, it was just trying to be like, “Oh, do I recognize that setting from only one screenshot from the comics?” And it was trying to create these really colorful, fun places that our artists would also have fun reinterpreting, and to make sure the player feels like they’re really traveling across the Marvel Universe and having a great big adventure.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: One of the biggest praises for the game is its educational element, which some people find in researching the deep cuts and underused locations and characters that appear. Like Phyla-Vell, Beta Ray Bill, and again, Destromundo. Can you talk a little more about how you chose these?\n\nGEMUS: Selecting 15 playable characters was a challenging thing to do. But at the same time, this still feels like it’s not enough, because we have such a love for these superheroes that we could have done a game with 36 of them and still felt there wasn’t enough. But one thing that was important for us was not necessarily to educate, but to surprise and bring players to some unfamiliar territories in a sense that, as you mentioned, there are some characters we haven’t seen many interpretations of – especially in games – like Nova. So, for us as designers and developers, it was fun to have a chance to help define how these characters could behave in an action game.\n\nBecause if you take Iron Man, for example, people expect Iron Man to be flying and using repulsors. There are abilities and ways to play Iron Man that come with the character, but we really thought it was fun and a great opportunity for us to help further develop how some characters, like Beta Ray Bill, could behave in an action game. Same thing with Phyla-Vell. These are characters we don’t often see, so in a way, we are also introducing them to new fans while helping develop the language across all Marvel games.\n\nDEADLINE: What was the hardest narrative challenge with all these new characters mingling in the game? Especially for those who don’t really have a connection in their own comics.\n\nBELZIL: The game is based on the comic book storyline Annihilation, which came out in 2006. When the Civil War event was happening on Earth in the comics, Annihilation was happening in space. And it’s a really cool story, but it’s more of a Game of Thrones, mature type of story that doesn’t have as many recognizable characters. Even the Guardians of the Galaxy, who became really popular from the movie, came from this comic. So, the big challenge was in figuring out how to make a version of this that is accessible for all ages because we want our games to be played by young kids, but also with their parents or just whole families in general. Fred and I decided that what if the Annihilation storyline was adapted inside the Spider-Man or X-Men cartoon of the ’90s? Then we figured our first six levels or so could be on Earth. You would get to travel a bit across Marvel Earth and encounter recognizable characters, and then they can go off into space together for further adventures and action.\n\nThen, the rest of the game was about how to parse out certain events from the comics, making sure they can happen in a manageable way in beat-’em-up form. At one point, Annihilus uses Galactus to destroy a planet, so the question becomes, how do we make that happen? We have to eventually build a manageable Galactus that can be in a level and do some traps and things like that. But those are more technical challenges for the rest of the staff, whereas I would go, “In level eight, Galactus should be there.”\n\nSome other fun challenges came from writing the dialogue and one-liners. There are one-liners that happen depending on which button the player presses. So, when you have 15 characters, and they say some fighting game type of thing when they execute a move, some characters came really easily, some were trickier, but the biggest thing is you don’t want them to repeat each other’s lines too much. That’s where the rubber really met the road for me, writing-wise, because there’s only so many things you can say to express something without repetition. This was especially true when it came to [the game mechanic of] swapping characters when they have to go, “Oh, up to you, so-and-so.” It was like, “Oh man, I have to find different versions of these characters calling each other.” And some of these characters don’t have relationships. Like, I don’t know if Storm has ever shared space with Cosmic Ghost Rider, so how do they feel about each other? I have to figure things like that out and give them unique one-liners.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: Fans are also responding positively to that character swap mechanic that you mentioned. Why do you think that is? And why was it important for you to build it into the game?\n\nGEMUS: [The idea started] with having 15 playable characters, and we wanted to make sure that they didn’t play the same. We wanted to make sure that Spider-Man does Spider-Man stuff. At the same time, Wolverine does all of the raging crazy things that Wolverine does, but that also means that we didn’t want it to give all abilities to everyone because if you look at classic beat-‘em-ups, for example, grabs and throws are going to be built most of the time within every character themselves. Still, we wanted to make sure to really focus on the differences and strengths of all the superheroes; it would be better to focus on the play style of each character through the lineup. That also meant that we got a bit worried at one point that maybe it would be overwhelming for the players to actually be able to pick someone because maybe they’d be like, “Oh, I’m going to pick Storm, but what if there is a moment where I wish I had She-Hulk with me or I’m going to play Iron Man, but maybe Wolverine would be better suited for that sequence.” So, we thought that by combining two characters together, you would be able to basically build one and have the advantages of both.\n\nThen, we thought about how to interact. At first, our system was a bit more complex, where you had to request that the other characters come in and perform specific actions. Then we realized that, since our target audience is so large, we wanted to make it a more accessible game, so we created a simple button system that lets the game infer the context of what you’re in and pick the right action. This was the funnest version of that complex system. For example, if an enemy grabs your hero and you’re stuck there, swapping means your second character will come in and free you with an attack. We thought that this was quite cool and lived up to the Marvel fantasy, because when you look at Marvel Comics, it’s always heroes teaming up. So, that system was so important to us because we wanted the player to feel like they are in a team of superheroes against Annihilus, who is basically alone and wants to remain alone in the end and destroy the whole universe so that he can just be the last one standing.\n\nBELZIL: I think the reason why people respond is just the mere sensation of being able to play with two action figures at once, which is really useful and fun in a primal way. Like, you get your two favorite heroes, and you can use them over and over and automate moves by having them chime in. There’s something about the fun of this time-honored Marvel Comics tradition to have characters meet up for the first time and then have them team up to go against a larger villain.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: I’d be remiss not to bring up the fan conversation around Silver Surfer’s butt. What say you? Apparently, the gamers are saying it is very round, fit and caked up.\n\nBELZIL: He is. I feel like he has an accurately depicted toned surfer physique. In fact, I think we might have been asked to tone down some of the pronunciation of his butt cheeks, but they still survived in the screen images, not in the gameplay [sequences]. So, the butt remains prominent and important, where you can see it. Silver Surfer worked hard for that butt, and we’re glad people can enjoy it.\n\nDEADLINE: What can players expect from the future? Any further additions to the game to look out for?\n\nGEMUS: Right now, we are on the other side of launch, meaning that we’re still looking at players’ reception. We’re also fixing bugs and trying to identify what needs improvement. It’s easy when you ship a game and have a team of 20 testers, vs launching the game and now there are 100,000s of people playing it. So, there are definitely some surprises that we are working hard on, but for now, this is pretty much our focus. We are looking at, do players love the game? Do they want more? Do they have hopes for extra content? We are listening, but we don’t have anything to announce at the moment.\n\n\n\nBELZIL: Look, we’ve seen every comment section become a suggestion box for future characters. And like they say on Pandora, “We see you.” But also, between when the game was actually done and when it came out, it’s not that long a stretch. So, it’s not like we have secret DLC in our back pocket that we’re waiting to spring on people. It’s exciting that people really want more, and they want their favorite characters as well. It’s fun to see the enthusiasm for the game and that they want more. So, we hope to deliver on that someday, but for now we’re just sitting back and enjoying it.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:11:23 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T21:25:06.258783"}

Friday-Sunday are free and clear of holidays and are pure moviegoing days. The worst for distributors is when Christmas Eve, a slow day, and Christmas Day fall on the Friday-Sunday span. That’s a wrench to turnstiles.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n20th Century Studios’ Avatar: Fire and Ash will continue to conquer with an estimated $75M 4-day take; $55M second 3-day weekend, -38%, from its $89.1M opening. Yesterday, the James Cameron directed, and Cameron, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Josh Friedman & Shane Salerno story by threequel crossed $398.7M worldwide. Monday domestic was $13.3M at 3,800 locations, -18% from Avatar: Way of Water‘s first Monday of $16.2M. Fire and Ash‘s total U.S./Canada running cume is $102.5M. That running cume for Fire and Ash is about $10M less than the combined first 4-day domestic totals of Mufasa and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 a year ago (which totaled $112.5M). Audience score for the Cameron Na’vi movie on Rotten Tomatoes remains at 91%.\n\nSony looks to be reviving comedy as its meta take of 1997’s Anaconda is looking at second place with $20M+ at 3,400 locations. There are previews starting tomorrow at 12noon for the Jack Black-Paul Rudd movie with Thursday showtimes at 2,900 locations starting as early as 9AM. So far, 39 critics don’t like it on Rotten Tomatoes at 39%. However, Anaconda is the only place for laughs this Christmas. First choice and unaided awareness for the $45M net production is best with guys under 25.\n\nUniversal Pictures International / Everett Collection\n\nThird, fourth, fifth and sixth will be a toss between Focus Features’ new Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson Neil Diamond tribute movie, Song Sung Blue, A24’s wide expansion of Josh Safdie’s Marty Supreme (already at $1M+ in six NYC and LA locations), and the second weekends of Angel Studio’s David and Lionsgate’s The Housemaid. All are eyeing $12M-mid-teens apiece over four days. Marty Supreme and Housemaid could overindex.\n\nSong Sung Blue from filmmaker Craig Brewer and produced by Brewer, John David and John Fox, will open in 2,400 locations on Christmas with previews starting at 2PM on Christmas Eve. Jackman and Hudson play real-life Wisconsin couple Mike and Claire Sardina who fell in love via their music impersonators’ acts. Their tale — a roller coaster. You gotta see the movie to find out what happens. Critics are 73% certified fresh. Hudson is up for Best Female in a Feature Comedy/Musical at the Golden Globes. Best unaided awareness is with men and women over 25, on par with last year’s A Complete Unknown and slightly higher than Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.\n\nThe Timothée Chalamet period dramedy Marty Supreme stands at 95% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and is best with men over 25 in first choice and unaided awareness. Previews start tomorrow around 12 noon. Anticipation is building especially in the wake of Chalamet’s recent viral stunt of standing atop The Sphere in Las Vegas and the Empire State Building which clocked 1.3M views on Instagram (I hear he truly braved this like a pro — he’s not a fan of heights). Social media reach for the Chalamet movie is 197M across TikTok, Instagram, X, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which isn’t far from Saltburn‘s 214M reach.\n\nChalamet’s Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown got a pure 5-day launch last Christmas, Wednesday-Sunday, grossing $23.2M; pic’s 3-day was $11.6M. It was great counterprogramming over the holiday ending its run at $75M.\n\nRelishMix says that pre-wide release social media stats on Marty Supreme are running 47% above high concept drama genre norms boosted by Chalamet’s 21.5M fans, Tyler the Creator’s 39M, Gwyneth Paltrow’s 15.2M followers, Kevin O’Leary’s 6.5M, Fran Drescher at 2.8M and Odessa A’Zion at 2M.\n\nSays RelishMix, “Convo runs positive for Marty Supreme when you cut through the static and lock onto the core fandom, who are here for Timmy, Tyler and Safdie magic. Devotion fires fast with lines like ‘I’m so excited about this film, I would watch anything with Timmy in it’ and ‘Clicked for Tim, stayed for Tyler, I’ll go to theaters since Tyler is in it.’ Table-tennis lifers show up strong, saying ‘As a table tennis lover, can’t wait to see Marty Supreme hit the big screen’ and ‘As someone whose main sport has been table tennis since I was a little kid, I have to watch this movie.’ Awards chatter peaks early with ‘I smell Oscars’ and ‘Oscars incoming, lighten up people.’ Fans brand the package prestige, from ‘A24 + Chalamet + Safdie = excellent’ to ‘Omg this looks brilliant.’ Even comps land flattering, with ‘Totally getting Forrest Gump vibes here and I’m in’ and ‘It’s Bob Dylan playing ping pong.'”\n\nYesterday, Zootopia 2 was No. 2 at the Monday B.O. with $4.3M at 3,540 and a running total of $287.4M. Remember, we told you that there were 81% K-12 out and 91% colleges on break.\n\nLionsgate’s Housemaid was $3.4M at 3,015 sites, -35% from Sunday, in third with a running four-day of $22.4M.\n\nAngel Studio’s David at 3,118 made $3.3M, -42% from Sunday, for a running cume of $25.2M.\n\nParamount’s SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants at 3,557 sites is up to $18.4M after four days with Monday taking in $2.8M, -34% from Sunday.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:00:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T21:25:06.560109"}

It also played in Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight section.\n\nA24 landed the indie dramatic comedy in Park City and released it in theaters in late June. It has since landed a Critics Choice nomination for the original screenplay, while Victor, maybe best known for their role in Showtime’s Billions, picked up a Best Actress – Drama nom from the Golden Globes. They are also up for Best Picture, Best Screenplay and Best Director at the Indie Spirits.\n\nIn the pic, which Victor wrote during the Covid lockdown in a Maine cabin, centers on Agnes, who we meet living in a quaint but somewhat isolated home near a New England college — they same place where she and her college roommate Lydie (Naomi Ackie, a Spirits nominee for Supporting Performer) lived when they were students. It seems Lydie and everyone else from that time has moved on, while Agnes has stayed put, on the verge of landing a big professor job in her old English department. It’s slowly revealed the reason Agnes seems stuck to everyone else: it’s the “bad thing,” being sexually assaulted by her thesis mentor (Louis Cancelmi), during her last year of school.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n(The act itself is never shown; rather, Agnes emerges from the event with what happened now simply a part of her. It’s a stunningly effective device.)\n\nThe film’s story is shown in several non-linear segments, and uses plenty of gallows humor to bring the reader into Agnes’ mind-set, skipping back and forth from before, during and after the moment she can’t forget and can’t get past, living with her like a specter (the college job she takes replaces her attacker, who fled after the incident; she even takes over his office). It takes Agnes’ ride-or-die buddy Lydie (now living in New York and having a baby) and a caring, somewhat smitten neighbor (Lucas Hedges) to help her maybe find a way through.\n\n“I found myself writing the film I felt I needed when I found myself in a similar crisis to Agnes,” Victor says about the script, which they say didn’t substantially change beyond the first draft. “I didn’t want to write about violence or assault specifically as much as I wanted to explore how a person heals. What interested me most was digging into that feeling of being stuck, seeing people you love moving on, while you’re still caught thick in the bad thing that happened to you. I started out writing this for the person I used to be.”\n\nThe film was produced in part by Barry Jenkins, Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak’s Pastel, which took Victor under its wing and and encouraged them to not only write and star but direct.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:04:20 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T22:25:39.108986"}

However, for one Diddy accuser there is nothing fun, funny or insightful about the comedian’s comments.\n\n“His latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs,” Jonathan Hay told Deadline.\n\n“Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once ‘missed his chance’ to have sex with her,” the producer added of the part of the December 19 dropped Unstoppable where the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor winner discussed allegations against Combs and his so-called “freak-offs” with the Me & U singer.” Such humor doesn’t just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it,” Hay adds.\n\nREAD ALL OF JONATHAN HAY’S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS BELOW\n\nLast month, the LA County Sheriff’s Department announced it has opened an investigation into claims of a 2020 sexual battery by Combs against music producer Hay. There was also a 2021 incident where Diddy said a kidnapped and hooded Hay was being a “snitch,” and allegedly ordered everyone else out of the room and then tried “to force plaintiff to perform oral copulation on Combs, while plaintiff’s head was still covered.”\n\nDiddy’s team responded to at the time to the claims in redacted filings by Hay by saying their client “categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone.”\n\nIf Combs is charged out of the LASD probe and found guilty, he could be sentenced to several years in California state prison. Right now, serving a four-year sentence in a low-security facility in New Jersey for being found guilty on July 2 of two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution in his sex trafficking and RICO trial, an appealing Combs isn’t expected to be free until mid-2028.\n\nToday, as the LASD probe continues according to law enforcement sources, Hay was vehement in his claims and criticism of “my favorite comedian of all time” Chappelle’s POV on Combs and his alleged actions of sexual violence and exploitation.\n\n“As someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren’t abstract punchlines, they’re relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me.”\n\nNow, it’s no secret that Chappelle likes to punch out for outrage’s sake. In the suddenly released Unstoppable, the comedian tells a riotous DC crowd in the tight 75-minute special of why he decided to perform at a comedy fest in Saudi Arabia despite the Kingdom’s 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, plus his take on reactions to Charlie Kirk’s death and trans rights (again).\n\nChappelle also admits a bias for Combs based on the Bad Boy Records founder leaping to his physical defense when an attacker stormed the stage while the comic was performing at the Hollywood Bowl in 2022. “It’s not that I think Puff is right, but when I got attacked in L.A. at the Hollywood Bowl, people forget Puff was the guy that tackled my attacker,” Chappelle tells the Unstoppable crowd. “He saved my life.”\n\n“That’s a hard dude to be mad at after that.”\n\nStill, it’s not all high fives as Chappelle details a visit to Diddy’s LA home not long afterwards that went sideways towards the end – though the comic didn’t realize it at the time.\n\n“I didn’t see none of the stuff they said in that trial,” Chappelle starts off. “House is clean, traction on the floor, nothing slippery,” he notes in a clear reference to the prodigious baby oil use that Combs was tainted with in testimony over his alleged sexual abuse of Ventura and other women with male escorts.\n\n“Puff started swirling his drink like this and he goes, ‘So Dave, what are you into?’” Chappelle then said after a bit of a chat between the duo. continues. “You know me, I was like, ‘I don’t know …books, video games.’ I didn’t know that was my big chance to f*ck Cassie.”\n\nLater, Chappelle swings it all around, sorta.\n\n“Cassie is a gangster,” he states of Combs’ ex, who spent days and days on the stand in a NYC federal courtroom earlier this year telling a jury of the years of drugs, violence, rape, multi-million dollar settlements and more from Diddy – testimony that was often backed up by videos and photos. “She did something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. She had to testify about her sex life. That’s tough.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chappelle did not respond to Deadline’s request for comment on Hay’s statement. Netflix did respond, but had no comment.\n\nAs of today, Chappelle’s self-proclaimed “no-holds-barred special” The Unstoppable is the Number #1 TV show on the streamer. That top spot is the same number #1 that the Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson produced Sean Combs; The Reckoning held just a few weeks ago\n\nREAD JONATHAN HAY’S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS HERE:\n\nDave Chappelle has long been my favorite comedian of all time, a master of sharp wit and unflinching social commentary. Yet his latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs. Throughout the show, Chappelle frames Combs’ recent Mann Act conviction as an example of racially motivated persecution, drawing parallels to the legendary boxer Jack Johnson, the very figure around whom the law was originally crafted to criminalize his relationship with a white woman across state lines.\n\nThe issue here is glaring: Combs was charged under the Mann Act for sex trafficking women of color, not for the interracial dynamics that fueled Johnson’s targeting. This mischaracterization overlooks the gravity of the allegations against Combs, which center on the exploitation and trafficking of women of color. Even more troubling, Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once “missed his chance” to have sex with her. Such humor doesn’t just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it.\n\nAs someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren’t abstract punchlines, they’re relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me. The pain never fully fades, and hearing a global icon like Chappelle defend an assailant while millions laugh along only amplifies the isolation. Imagine if Chappelle himself, or his sons Sulayman and Ibrahim, were victims of violent sexual assault. How would he feel watching a comedian publicly champion their abuser, turning their suffering into worldwide entertainment? It’s not comedy; it’s callous. We deserve better from the artists we admire.\n\nAs a survivor still carrying the weight of what happened, moments like these in Chappelle’s special only deepen my resolve and make me all the more eager for the ongoing criminal investigations by both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department into the allegations against Sean Combs, CJ Wallace, and Willie Mack to deliver the accountability I deserve.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:18:10 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T02:10:55.545803"}

The announcement was wince-inducing for National Geographic, which saw its prime contender go unrecognized, even though the film in question had just won the IDA Award for Best Feature Documentary. Likewise, HBO Documentary Films came up short with one of its top hopefuls – a documentary directed by a famed actress. HBO, however, was rewarded with recognition for The Alabama Solution, the investigative documentary directed by Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman.\n\nEye-opening for Oscar doc watchers — the quantity of films lacking U.S. distribution that overcame that barrier to earn a place on the feature shortlist, among them Holding Liat, Seeds, Yanuni and Coexistence, My Ass! Ridley, an Oscar winner himself (12 Years a Slave) and a member of the Academy, praises the doc branch for embracing Seeds, but he expresses outrage over the omission of a film directed by Davis Guggenheim and Nyle DiMarco.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“Really? Really?” Ridley says with incredulity regarding that snub.\n\nOne film had to cut through rocks to get onto the shortlist. Also in the mix — a documentary from a filmmaker who won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature just two years ago, and another by a filmmaker who earned her Academy Award a decade ago.\n\nWe also put the short documentaries shortlist under the microscope. Some prominent filmmakers were recognized there including Joshua Seftel, Ondi Timoner and Jay Rosenblatt. The remarkable Geeta Gandbhir made the shortlist for an acclaimed feature she directed and for short documentary she co-directed, an impressive two-fer.\n\nThat’s on the new episode of Doc Talk, hosted by Ridley and Carey, Deadline’s senior documentary editor.

She is one of 13 survivors of the global shift known as The Joining, which has fused almost all of humanity into a single shared consciousness with whom she’s eager to merge. A special gas has been delivered via plane, and she happily inhales it, briefly convulsing in a state of hive-mind bliss. She’s one of the Others now, and they all evacuate the village expeditiously. One down, 12 to go.\n\nIn the episode, titled “La Chica o El Mundo” (“The Girl or the World”), a bloodied Manousos (Carlos Manuel Vesga) completes his death-defying journey from Paraguay to New Mexico. And Carol (Rhea Seehorn) is playing house with Zosia (Karolina Wydra). With the rest of the unaffected living in delusion and shooting the shit on weekly Zoom meetings, Manousos may be Carol’s last hope at (in his view) saving humanity. But while he’s been trekking through the Darién Gap and teaching himself English, Carol’s been playing croquet and sleeping with the enemy.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe two “Old-Schoolers,” as the cast and crew of “Pluribus” refer to them, don’t exactly get along. Manousos dumps Carol’s phone through a drain grate, and they bicker about whether the Others are, in fact, people. Carol’s situationship with Zosia has softened her views on the 7 billion people stricken with the mind virus, so much so that she threatens Manousos with a shotgun as he attempts to cure one of them with radio frequencies.\n\nEventually, Carol chooses the titular girl over the world, and she and Zosia embark on globe-trotting adventures, including a luxurious ski trip. The honeymoon phase comes to a screeching halt, however, when Zosia lets it slip that the Others have found a way to potentially convert Carol into one of them, against her will. It was previously established that they would need her stem cells, but their biological imperative prevents them from retrieving them via injection without her consent. Now, Zosia admits, the Others have discovered eggs that Carol had frozen with her late wife, Helen. Through a tricky, months-long process, they hope to convert the eggs into stem cells, which they could use to share their happiness with Carol.\n\nThis betrayal makes Carol go nuclear — literally. Remember when the Others told her they’d give her an atom bomb if she asked for one? Well, now they have. Back in Albuquerque, she and Manousos make a pact to save the world by any means necessary.\n\nIn two interviews, Seehorn and “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan, director-writer-EP Gordon Smith and writer-EP Alison Tatlock break down those finale twists and reveal their original, less explosive Season 1 ending.\n\nA major revelation in this episode is that the Others have Carol’s frozen eggs, which they can turn into stem cells, which they can use to convert her into one of them. Previously, they said they would need her consent — what changed?\n\nGILLIGAN: Well, literally, the Others are very lawyerly. The specific question that was put to them — which they answered via signboard on that hotel casino in Las Vegas — was, “Is it true you need our stem cells?” And the answer was yes. Then Carol asked, “Is it further true that to collect those stem cells, you would need to stick a needle in my hip?” They were very cautious about how it was phrased. It’s like in Episode 2, when one of the characters says, “So, you are vegetarians?” There’s a little pause, and then Zosia says, “We would prefer to be vegetarians, yes.” It’s very “Perry Mason”–esque, very lawyerly in how they answer questions. But nothing literally changed.\n\nSMITH: We talked about the possibility that maybe they learned something new about Carol’s eggs. They said at the very beginning, “We’re trying to figure out how to turn you.” And then they learned how to turn her. They can learn things.\n\nTATLOCK: They don’t need consent to change people, of course, because the premise of the show — right from the pilot — is that they change everybody as quickly as possible, first by kissing and eventually by planes flying overhead. If they could put their special spice in the water, they absolutely would. What they do need is consent to intrude upon somebody’s physical being. So they couldn’t take her stem cells directly. But if her stem cells already exist — or if the eggs, which aren’t stem cells, can be converted through a tricky process into stem cells — and they’re already outside of her body, they’ll do it.\n\nSo, it’s still the case that they cannot lie, but they can withhold information?\n\nGILLIGAN: They can mislead you all the live-long day. Absolutely. We were talking about “Perry Mason” — the Raymond Burr version from the ’50s. The famous moment in that show is when someone says, “What if I told you the killer was on the street at 3?” And later in the episode someone says, “You told me the killer was on the street at 3,” and Raymond Burr says, “No, I said, what if I told you.” That’s the key to it. For us, with these folks, they’re very lawyerly.\n\nSMITH: They can lie by omission.\n\nLet’s talk about Zosia’s betrayal of Carol.\n\nSEEHORN: I don’t think the betrayal could have been larger. Carol was living in a willing delusion. But there was always a part of her still in there. So, by the time Zosia says, “We stole your eggs,” it’s like: the eggs that represent the future that I wanted with my wife, who is now dead, partially because of you? And I also told you implicitly that I don’t want this, and you’re doing it behind my back? It’s also that horrible feeling of feeling like a fool for letting your guard down for a second. For Carol, it’s magnified: How did I dare think I could have love and joy? On top of that, this massive clock is now ticking about how long Carol has before they’re going to turn her.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nWhat is Zosia’s motive for kissing Carol in Episode 8?\n\nTATLOCK: I think the motive behind the kiss, from the Others’ point of view, is to offer Carol something that would bring her comfort and pleasure and help her forget her troubles for a little while. I think it’s an act of love in their mind. Now, watching it, you could say it’s an act of manipulation, or maybe even worse. But from their point of view, they feel like they’re giving her something she longed for but wasn’t able to fully take for herself, and that it would help her get through a hard, transitional chapter in her life — the chapter before being changed into one of them.\n\nTo what extent is Carol enamored by Zosia?\n\nSEEHORN: Enamored is a great way to put it. I think she is sincerely enamored by her. The kiss is something Carol didn’t even know how much she needed. Even when she runs down the driveway to hug her [in Episode 6], I think Carol is profoundly shaken and surprised by how much she — who used to be such a misanthrope and crave being alone all the time — could be pushed to the limits of realizing, I do need people. I need companionship. Voluntary isolation is a much different thing than involuntary isolation. She’s in an extraordinarily vulnerable and fragile place in that scene.\n\nAs to whether the Others are “manipulating” Carol, I suppose every action can be justified by, “We just want to make you happy, Carol.” But at what point does making Carol happy mean the same thing as, “We’re going to give you everything you want so that we see eye to eye on things?” It’s not lost on me that Episode 8 is titled “Charm Offensive”!\n\nGILLIGAN: You’re definitely asking the right questions. What it boils down to is two people trying desperately to change each other. It’s a very dramatic set of circumstances, and I think about how this plays out in relationships all the time — people who love someone but also want to change them. You hear about that all the time: “We’re going to get married, and I’m going to change them.”\n\nSEEHORN: How do we separate altruism and manipulation? Most acts of kindness and love do have a payoff, even if it’s just feeling good about yourself. Even unconditional love might be a child you have a responsibility to raise, or a fear of being alone, or a desire to receive love back. I honestly don’t know the answer, and I haven’t asked Vince to definitively tell me. I know he’s thrilled that it’s open to interpretation — whether the Others are being manipulative, whether they’re being sincere, and whether those two things can coexist.\n\nWhy does Carol threaten Manousos to stop experimenting on the Other? She’s come a long way from how she felt at the beginning of the series.\n\nSEEHORN: From the very beginning, as angry as Carol was — screaming at them, “You murdered my wife, I want nothing to do with you!” — she always felt horrible about physically harming any of them. She always showed extreme guilt, even to the degree that she was willing to suppress her rage in order not to harm them. She even asks them at one point, when she’s in Spain, “Can you give me anything to make me stop doing this?” And that’s early on, when she still hates them.\n\nNow, she has feelings for Zosia that are individualized, which illustrates to Carol that these are humans with a neurological shift, and they should not be harmed. So when she sees Manousos screaming at that guy shaking on the couch, she knows that not only could it cause Zosia to go into cardiac arrest, it could also mean killing millions of people all over the world again. And it infuriates her that he can’t see any other way. At the same time, the audience knows she’s being extraordinarily defensive, because this guy can see through her. He knows she’s lying about why they came back and why she cares [about them] more now.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nIt seems like a lot of her conversation with Manousos is informed by the last couple days she spent with Zosia. I’m not sure she would have said the Others are “not evil” even a couple episodes ago.\n\nSEEHORN: Fair point. The romantic part of it and feeling like she actually has a companion has muddied that. Some people have asked me if the Others leaving Carol in that extreme state of isolation was a manipulative tool to make her need them. I don’t know the answer to that, and I hadn’t even thought about it. I thought they were trying to protect themselves. But whatever the result is, Carol would absolutely see them coming back as an act of compassion. Many things have happened that make her feel like these people deserve compassion. They helped me. They put my Sprouts back. They made sure I was taken care of. Even when they couldn’t stand me, they brought me anything I wanted. And when I needed companionship, they gave it to me.\n\nWe see the Other drive away, seemingly unfazed by Manousos’ experiment. Just for the record: It did not work, correct? There is no way he has been converted back?\n\nGILLIGAN: I never even thought of that.\n\nSMITH: He’s not converted back. If he were converted back, Zosia would be doing something else. I don’t think she would be walking out to leave Albuquerque. There would be a four-alarm fire on their hands.\n\nTATLOCK: He would be very disoriented. He just looks placid and pleasant.\n\nGILLIGAN: Rick! That’s his name. Rick just gets in his Prius and leaves.\n\nSurveillance is something Carol and Manousos bicker about. Manousos is more afraid than Carol about being spied on via digital devices. To what extent is that reasonable, or is he just paranoid?\n\nTATLOCK: We know there are drones. We’ve seen the drones come in and out to deliver things. We know in the beginning Carol says, “Are you spying on me?” So, Manousos is not entirely wrong to suspect that they’re being watched. There are many reasons to believe someone is keeping an eye on them.\n\nGILLIGAN: They basically have admitted that.\n\nWhy does Manousos start speaking to Zosia after months of staunchly resisting the Others? I mean, he decides to cross the Darién Gap so that he doesn’t have to interact with them.\n\nGILLIGAN: I think it’s his interaction with Carol. Carol says to him, “Have you tried just talking to them?,” which is rich coming from her, because in Episode 2 the character Laxmi says to Carol, “Have you not asked these people questions? Why have you not asked them what it’s like?” And now the shoe is on the other foot. Seven episodes later, Carol is saying, “Why don’t you just talk to these people?” And I think he takes her at her word. He tries it. And because he might be starting to feel like, I don’t know if I’m going to get straight answers from this woman whom I came 6,000 kilometers to talk to.\n\nTATLOCK: Yeah, he becomes suspicious of Carol, so he decides to try a different tack, which is to get information about Carol from Zosia.\n\nYou have Chekhov’s gun in this season. You also have Chekhov’s atom bomb. When was it apparent that the nuke was going to be a major crux of this season?\n\nGILLIGAN: Surprisingly late.\n\nSMITH: A day or two into shooting the episode was when that became clear.\n\nTATLOCK: It was not the ending we broke together in the writers’ room. We adjusted it later, which is a bit unusual.\n\nGILLIGAN: We had an ending that was perfectly good. It would have been satisfying but not as satisfying. And we got a note. You know the old thing about how executives always have stupid notes. Actually, Apple and Sony said, “Is there an even better ending to be had?” And we listened, and I’m really glad they gave us that note. It made for a better ending.\n\nTATLOCK: We had planted the seed in Episode 3 but we didn’t have an exact plan to pay it off in this way. It opened an opportunity to do that.\n\nCan you share the ending you originally had planned?\n\nSMITH: It was similar to that ending. It was more subtle. Carol secretly forges a pact with Manousos, slips him a note and is perhaps going to play double agent. There wasn’t as much of a flag planted, like: “Nope, I’m not doing this. This relationship with the Others can’t continue.”\n\nGILLIGAN: Other than the atom bomb not being part of it, it was not open warfare. It was, I’m going to continue to be a double agent. It was covert. Even before we got the note, we thought, Is this the most satisfying way to go? Do we buy this?\n\nWhy do they give her the atom bomb? I know it’s established early on, but if they’ll go against her wishes with the stem cells, why won’t they go against her wishes with the nuke?\n\nGILLIGAN: Good question. They contain multitudes. It’s this constant tension between wanting to make her happy [and protecting themselves]. As horribly destructive as one atom bomb is… obviously, they don’t want her to set it off. But if she did — no pun intended — one atom bomb would not be the end of the world.\n\nTATLOCK: There are 7 billion of them populating the entire Earth, so they are trying to placate her as best as they can, and they know they have the upper hand.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nWhat would Earth look like if the Others converted everybody? In the opening scene of the finale, they immediately leave the village after converting Kusimayu, because they have no reason to be there. And those bodies have no reason to even be with each other anymore — that family has no purpose. In other words, who are the Others without the Old-Schoolers?\n\nSMITH: In Episode 8, we hear about the dish they’re building, so we know they have some sense of purpose. We’re not 100% clear on what that looks like, or what the boundaries around that are, but we do think that it might be a nice world.\n\nTATLOCK: It’s a peaceful world. They’re a collective, and they are entirely pragmatic, so there’s no need anymore for them to recreate culture or to play pretend. If there’s no more Old-Schoolers left, they don’t need to do what they’re doing for Mr. Diabaté [Samba Schutte] or for Kusimayu. So, they are living as efficiently as possible and at peace with each other and with the Earth, but with no attachment.\n\nGILLIGAN: The perfect reaction to the show is for the viewer to decide for themself: Is this paradise or is this hell? You could watch, for instance, the way the Others walk away from that Peruvian village and say, “Oh my God, this is a nightmare. Suddenly everybody is cold to one another.” But if you look really closely, they’re not actually cold to each other. They’re just there. It’s like all the cells in my body — I’m not paying attention to each one, but they make up one whole organism. They are happy, I think. But then again, is that paradise, or is it hell?\n\nWhy is it important that Carol is not necessarily always “likable” — or the perfect hero?\n\nSEEHORN: She is a reluctant hero, to say the least. She definitely was not hoping to lead the revolution, but she feels like nobody else will. Her behavior is flawed because she is an everyman who is faced with an insane circumstance. She is not heightened. She is in a fantastical world, but she herself is utterly realistic, emotionally. What would you do if you found yourself feeling like you were in a dystopian, apocalyptic nightmare? I’d rather watch somebody misbehave in that moment, as long as it’s truthful. Her vulnerability when she finds out that the other English speakers are all hanging out without her on weekly Zooms — that’s so human. We’ve all been there. I have been excluded from certain lunch tables in the cafeteria. That hurts, even when the big picture is much bigger.\n\nI also find her suppression of rage very interesting to explore. I know she’s impulsive. I know she shouldn’t be screaming or saying some of the things she says. But I also know that in my real life, many women I know should not be suppressing their anger and rage as much as they are. They should not be lowering their voices or trying so hard to be palatable. Those are flaws, too.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T08:36:53.427815"}

She also launched an interview podcast, In the Makeup Chair, which features conversions with guests about beauty, business and behind-the-scenes life.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHer new agency, NAO Talent, was quietly set up in September 2025 by creator-manager duo Amelia Olivia and Niamh Plunkett. They formed the business out of Olivia’s own creator career, after identifying a gap in the market for a management company that approaches careers and dealmaking from both a creator and commercial perspective.\n\nOlivia is a well-established content creator who also began her career in the beauty industry. She has grown a community of more than 1.5 million subscribers across platforms.\n\n“NAO Talent really was born out of our own lived experience,” Olivia told Deadline. “As my career as a creator grew, my manager Niamh and I realised that creators are effectively building full-scale businesses, but most structures were still treating them like short-term marketing channels.\n\n“We’d gone from small gifting deals to global partnerships and billboards and it became clear that what moved the needle wasn’t luck, it was strategy, alignment and having someone in your corner who genuinely understands the creative and commercial sides of this industry. We launched NAO Talent together because there was a real gap for creator-first management that helps talent build sustainable, fulfilling careers – not just chase the next campaign.”\n\nNAO’s co-founders believe the creator economy has evolved to the point they need proper infrastructure and well-being support to handle their newly-found fame. “Young creators are now founders, storytellers and cultural voices, but they’re often navigating brand deals, pricing, legal, creative direction and community management alone,” said Plunkett.\n\nWe hear NAO plans to unveil several new talent signings in early 2026.\n\n“We’re interested in building careers,” added Olivia. “That means thoughtful partnerships, long-term ambassadorships, creative collaborations and brand work that makes sense for the talent and their audience.\n\n“We’re also intentional about helping creators build equity and IP – whether that’s through product, media, licensing or other IP-driven opportunities. There’s a huge shift happening where creators aren’t just promoting brands, they’re co-creating them, and we want our talent to be at the forefront of that. Ultimately, we prioritise deals that feel aligned, strategic and sustainable – where creators are seen as partners with perspective, not just content producers with reach.”\n\nCreator-focused agencies are popping in numbers as the industry evolves, with more and more stars who broken through on television shows signing with the newer companies or traditional agencies such as Curtis Brown, CAA or United Agents.\n\n“At the core of it, we just wanted to take everything we’d learned – the wins, the mistakes, the messy middle – and use it to help other creators’ build incredible careers that they’re proud of, from real, lived experience,” said Olivia.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T10:28:38.191173"}

After a coffee and a chat, she there and then offered him a role in Goodbye June, her directing debut that streams on Netflix from today following a limited theatrical run.\n\nA few days prior to their meeting, Heartstopper actor Akinade, acclaimed for his virtuosity on stage, was on the top deck of a London bus when his agent called with the news The Holiday, The Reader and Mildred Pierce star was directing a film and wanted to meet. “I said, ‘How the fuck does she know who I am?’”\n\nHis agent then asked if he’d like to know who he could be acting opposite. The names of Helen Mirren, Toni Collette, Timothy Spall, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Winslet herself were reeled off.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“‘What the fuck is going on?,’” he recalls spurting.\n\nThe film, written by Joe Anders, the son of Winslet and Sam Mendes, is about a matriarch of the family dying at Christmastime. Winslet wanted Akinade to play Angel, the cancer ward nurse caring for Mirren’s June, the title character, while her husband, their four children and grandchildren wait by her bedside.\n\nThe venue of the meeting was the Soho Hotel. As Akinade ran to the loo, Winslet came into view. “I thought, ‘Jesus. This is a woman I have watched since I was about 12 years old, and she’s just here in the flesh – so warm and lovely and funny and honest.’ We had coffee. She spoke about the film, spoke about herself, what she’d been up to, and then she said: ‘Well, listen, I want you to do it. There’s nobody else I’m seeing. I’m not asking anybody else.’”\n\nIt was agreed and an offer was made. Winslet then suggested he accompany her on auditioning some children for the pic, and even reading with them. They left the hotel together and Akinade recalls finding the situation “insane,” saying of Winslet, “She has an air about her that’s just very easy and breezy – I sort of liken it to how Denzel Washington and Pauletta Washington handle themselves. They’re both very famous people, but then they just get about in a way that means people aren’t flocking or hounding them.”\n\nAkinade took notice. “I do think it’s something that you cultivate,” he says. “You either choose to cultivate anonymity or you choose to cultivate fanfare.”\n\nNigerian roots\n\nAkinade was born in Liverpool, but when he was a baby he and his Nigerian parents went to Nigeria, returning to live in Manchester when he was an infant of four or five. By that time, the child could only speak Yoruba. “I knew loads of insults,” he says proudly.\n\nHis favourite phrase in Yoruba was to tell someone, “You’re the son of a goat and is your head all right?”\n\nOver breakfast at the Dean Street Restaurant in Soho, we chat about him playing nurse Angel, working with Winslet, with Judi Dench on The Vote and his analysis of the West End, and joke about what Nigerian traits we both might have. We’d been introduced a few weeks beforehand at a tea party for Winslet hosted by Netflix.\n\nI’m not sure that I want to reveal it exactly, but we laughed over how we both show our displeasure. I will say that it’s all very Nigerian!\n\nFisayo Akinade Baz\n\nFor the longest time I’d been aware of Akinade’s work on stage ever since he appeared as The Boy in a touring production of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. However, I really became aware of him when he appeared in the two dramas that Russell T Davies penned for Channel 4 in 2012, Banana and Cucumber.\n\nHe kept popping up all over the place and then Josie Rourke cast him in James Graham’s immersive 2015 general election drama The Vote at the Donmar Warehouse Theatre, where the theatrical all-star ensemble included Dame Judi, Mark Gatiss, Catherine Tate,Nina Sosanya, Timothy West, Rosalie Craig, Bill Paterson, Paul Chahidi, Jade Anouka, Jude Law, Finty Williams, Heather Craney, Hadley Fraser and Prasanna Puwanarajah.\n\nI guess the point is: who wasn’t in it?!\n\nLike Dame Judi, Akinade enjoys doing crossword puzzles. “She’s the nicest woman alive,” he says, eyes sparkling as he recalls their time working on The Vote.\n\nThe immersive production had a handful of performances leading up to a live broadcast on election night, which I was lucky enough to attend, on More4. It was timed to end on the dot at 10pm local time when polls closed.\n\n“Inbuilt into the play were cues to let you know how far ahead or behind you were,” says Akinade. “There was a point where we were a little bit behind hitting ten o’clock, and someone came on and announced the time, which meant that we were behind. Judi out of nowhere started firing her lines out so quickly, and then everybody on stage started firing their lines too and we caught up in the play, ending bang on ten. We’d never hit that target before. It was amazing,” he marvels.\n\nHowever, Akinade, in an astute analysis of the West End, feels that nowadays theater is “at a weird junction” because, he suggests, “There’s real pressure to make money and keep it robust. AI hurt and the writers and actors strikes in America hurt. You’ve got a lot of actors and and then there’s not enough money, so everyone who was doing prestige TV and film came down. The film stars started doing TV. The TV stars started doing plays, so it squeezed everybody down.”\n\nLook at the West End, for example, he argues: “There is a celebrity in almost every show, and I get it because they need to pull [audiences], but what’s going to happen is people won’t go now unless there’s somebody recognizable in a lead role.\n\n“Before you could put a play like Downstate [Bruce Norris’s controversial drama about child-sex offenders] on at the National Theatre, and people would be like, ‘It’s the greatest piece of fucking acting you will ever see from the greatest ensemble cast from [Steppenwolf] Chicago ever.’ It would sell out, whereas now, you’ve got to put your stars in, otherwise you’re screwed,” he says with concern in his voice.\n\nTo a point, because there are A-listers who are genuine creatures of the stage such as Billy Crudup and Denise Gough in High Noon at the Harold Pinter – and what about Bryan Cranston, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Paapa Essiedu in Ivo van Hove’s unbelievably powerful revival of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons at Wyndham’s Theatre? They’re all legit. “And that’s the nuance,” says Akinade. “He [Crudup] happens to be very famous – and he’s a theater actor.”\n\nL/R Fisayo Akinade and Gemma Arterton in ‘Saint Joan’ Jack Sain\n\nNot long after appearing in The Vote, the Donmar offered Akinade a role in George Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan with Gemma Arterton, but the part in question wasn’t for him. “Very early and quite riskily, I said no thank you to the Donmar,” he explains. The theater soon came back and asked him to play the Dauphin and he took it because he believes it’s the best part in the play. “It was one of the best times,” he recalls. “I just got to be a petulant king and it was so fun.”\n\nTurning down the initial part was “scary” because, “If you’re not working as an actor, you are not earning a thing,” he says. “You may have to do a few shifts in the pub, but now having been 14 years in [the business], the power of ‘no’ is so important. You really have to, for yourself, determine what you are going to do and what you will not do. What you say ‘no’ to is far more important than what you say ‘yes’ to.”\n\nWhat will he not do? “All I want to do is play roles that have interesting arcs – a character is different at the end of the thing than they are at the beginning,” he says. “They’re changed somehow. I don’t care about being the lead or supporting character.”\n\nFor example, the Reverend Hale part,which the actor played in Arthur Miller’s The Crucible directed by Lyndsey Turner at the National Theatre, is for him the greatest arc in that play because the character is “somebody that is so devout and utterly convicted – and then he sees that this divine thing he has spent his life devoted to is corruptible. I just find that shift so potent,” he reasons.\n\nL-R: Erin Doherty and Fisayo Akinade in ‘The Crucible’ Johan Persson\n\nIt’s the same reason he played Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet opposite Josh O’Connor and Jessie Buckley in director Simon Godwin’s production that was bound for the National Theatre until Covid happened and it was filmed for the National and Sky Arts.\n\nNational Theatre at home.\n\nBackground work\n\nAkinade says that Winslet set up hands-on-experience meetings with two palliative care nurses on a cancer ward at a London hospital in preparation for his role. What was important for Akinade is that Muti Akinade, his mom, has been a carer for most of his life – first with the elderly and now with people with adult learning difficulties.\n\nHe felt the role allowed him to pay homage to his mother. “The way my mum cares is very Nigerian, so it is very tough love, monumental love. She had all these amazing techniques for getting in and soothing, so that’s one aspect that I wanted to bring to Angel.”\n\nOne of the nurses Winslet introduced him to was a 30-year veteran who still had the enthusiasm for care, compassion and empathy “despite the hours, despite the pay, despite how they’re sometimes treated, despite all of the things NHS nurses have to endure.”\n\nThe nurse alos provided the actor with one of the film’s best lines. “She said, ‘When a patient comes in for end of life care, my first thought is that we have to get it right. We have to make sure this person gets a good goodbye.’”\n\nL-R: Johnny Flynn as Connor, Andrea Riseborough as Molly, Timothy Spall as Bernie, Kate Winslet as Julia and Fisayo Akinade as Angel in ‘Goodbye June’ Kimberley French/Netflix\n\nAkinade texted Winslet referencing the “good goodbye” adage and her immediate response was, “‘That’s going in the film.’ And then it did.” Sipping his coffee, he adds: “That was just so beautiful because that’s a real life quote from a real NHS nurse, and it was just very important to me to represent the NHS properly.”\n\nAs the film plays out, Angel observes the four siblings, especially the petty quarrels between the sisters played by Winslet and Riseborough. Wisely, he well understands that families bicker but knows the arguments should come later. “When your mum goes, are you going to be thinking about what happens to her ring, or are you just going to be missing your mum,” asks Akinade of his character’s motivations. “You can fight later. None of this is important.”\n\nI realize that I had watched the film through Angel’s eyes. It’s his common sense that helps get the family in shape to see what’s happening to the matriarch. I’m a fervent believer in gaining wisdom from art.\n\nAkinade agrees and says that Steven Spielberg’s film The Color Purple “was one of the most formative” he’s seen because “there’s a woman that is horrendously abused who not only finds her power, but also finds love in that.”\n\nHe watched the film with his mother at a time when he was being bullied at school. “And she knew that,” he recalls. “So she was like, ‘Come and watch this.’ She was essentially saying, ‘Look what happened to this woman. Look. And now look at her at the end. Look how happy she is. Look how free she’s about to be. You’ll be all right.’”\n\nSunday was their day to sit and watch films. It could be The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and The Clash of the Titans. One day when he was maybe 13, he watched Philadelphia, starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. “It was probably too soon, but that was deeply, profoundly moving for me and I don’t think my mum or dad at the time understood why,” says Akinade. “For me, I was like, ‘Oh, look at this man defending this gay man… with such conviction.’”\n\nIt was very surreal moment, he says, when he appeared in Jeremy O. Harris’s Slave Play featuring Olivia Washington when he got to meet her parents, Pauletta Washington and Denzel Washington. “He was just ginormous in his energy, but so warm,” says Akinade. “He turned to me and exclaimed, ’Oh, you. You’re really good.’ He pulled me into a bear hug and then sort of jokingly said, ‘If you keep going, you can be something special.’ That is all I will need for the rest of my days,” he says with a satisfied sigh.\n\nAll of this was happening around the time Denzel’s son, Malcom Washington, was preparing his film, The Piano Lesson, for that year’s awards season. Suddenly, he and I are heaping praise on Danielle Deadwyler with Akinade insisting that “somebody give her the Viola [Davis] treatment” and find her roles that catapult her star. We spend an inordinate about of time discussing the roles both Deadwyler and Davis have played on screen.\n\nL-R Helen Mirren as June and Kate Winslet as Julia in ‘Goodbye June’ Kimberley French/Netflix\n\nAkinade recalls being in a cinema and “literally levitating“ when he watched Davis standing toe-to-toe with Meryl Streep in Doubt.\n\nDuring a conversation last summer, Winslet revealed to me that Akinade’s role as Angel originally wasn’t as big a part as it has now become. “He’s so bloody good, he can do anything,” she said. The part grew through the two of them “just chatting,” is how Akinade puts it.\n\n“I would get a text every now and then saying, ‘We just added this’ or ‘I think we’re going to get you more involved in this bit.’ I thought that’s really lovely because as much as it is a film about a family’s matriarch dying and the family coming back together, I also think it’s a real love letter to carers, nurses and the NHS, and the ways in which those people in that institution take care of the entire [British] nation for free.”\n\nHe becomes visibly moved as he explains that his own father had been treated for cancer. “He beat cancer twice because of care – and he had that care for free.”\n\nAkinade reckons that because Winslet gave him so much more to do in the film, “That through line became more potent – and therefore more personal for me – because it’s just a lovely little side story.”\n\nAvoiding tokenism\n\nI love that Angel is not a black character that can be deemed token. Akinade laughs then observes sharply that this can’t be the case when it comes to the NHS, “Because you go to any hospital and who’s looking after you?” He adds: “Yes, it would have been tokenism if it wasn’t true.”\n\nHis mother was very touched by Angel when she attended the London premiere. What the character does for the family in Goodbye June is such an act of empathy and generosity, the kind that’s not often publicly highlighted. Akinade’s a big brother to two sisters. His parents live in Manchester, as does his younger sibling, while his middle sister resides in London. He loves going home to visit where “it’s the place I’m my most comfortable self anywhere.”\n\nThere was never any pressure from his parents about him becoming an actor. They knew that the life is not always the easiest, but he’s grateful that they never suggested he become a doctor. Once they saw he was getting theater work regularly and then cast in Banana and Cucumber they knew he would be alright.\n\nHis widest variety of roles have been on stage. “There’s a bit more imagination there,” he says. However, he has had the best time working on screen in all manner of shows, including Heartstopper. In the Netflix series he plays Mr. Ajayi, and lauds the series for doing “so much for young LGBTQ people.”\n\nSome people watching it, he says, “Wish they’d had this level of freedom, openness and care when I was at school because it does feel, in some cases, easier to be open and out about your sexuality or gender identity or whatever it may be now, than it was then, which is amazing.”\n\nFisayo Akinade in ‘Heartstopper’ Netflix\n\nWorking on other shows has been helpful for him, he says. “I’ve been gay a very long time, but when Cucumber was coming out I was like, ‘How do I navigate this?’ I called Russell T. Davis and he met me in Pret in Euston Station, and said, ‘There’s one question and one answer. Are you gay? Yes you are.’ He said, ‘If you don’t [embrace] that, you will spend your life terrified of being caught out and found out…You will be a half version of yourself. So are you? Yes. And on you move.’\n\n“Then you are unburdened… from the fear of being caught out. It was a scary thing [but] it actually hasn’t held me back.”\n\nQuite right too. Why should it matter? There are too many meaningless distinctions, he argues, but there are some useful ones too, he suggests. For instance, “You want to buy a sofa. When you talk to the assistant, you say, ‘I would like a soft sofa or a big sofa or an L-shaped sofa. They’re useful distinctions for what you want.\n\n“But when you say to a person, ‘Daniel Day Lewis, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, they are actors. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Forest Whittaker, Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, they’re black actors. Why? What’s the difference? The job is exactly the same. So why put in the word black or gay or northern or working class before the job of actor, what does it do? What function does that distinction have? Serves no purpose or other than to other.”\n\nContinuing, he says: “There are people that act and there are black people that act. I think that sets off prejudices in people’s heads.”\n\nBut sometimes the casting of an actor who is black can transform a role. We both jump on Cynthia Erivo in Wicked as an example. “Having a black woman play that role makes Elphaba’s difference more potent,” he says. “As soon as you include a person of color in something, it is going to be whether consciously or unconsciously, an aspect of that is going to become racialized – of course it is. Now you have Elphaba who’s green, played by a black woman. There is another layer, another nuance, that is challenging audiences to invest on a deeper level.”\n\nUpcoming he has a television drama which for now he’s not able to discuss. In any event, he says he’s lucky to have worked with great stars such as Mirren and Dench. Initially, he admits he was “scared’” of meeting the former “because she’s Helen Mirren,” but he didn’t need to worry. “She was just the loveliest, so not starry and down to earth.”\n\nThe same was true for Dame Judi. When they did a run-through of The Vote at a church hall in Islington, he arrived early, and Dench and Finty Williams, her daughter, pitched up shortly afterwards. “She went, ’Hello, I’m Judi’… And she went, ‘Feel my palm. Feel it… that’s cold sweat. I’m fucking terrified. Don’t judge me on what I do today.’ I said, ‘But you’re fucking Judi Dench!’ She said, ‘I fucking know who I am. Don’t judge me.’ And I was like, ‘Well, I won’t. Of course not.’”\n\nFisayo Akinade is already a great actor and a deeply caring dude. That’s why he steals Goodbye June with one tiny line.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:18:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:24:24.795144"}

Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo is back after a 12-year absence to the West End, as Deadline was first to report, to play all 23 roles in a bloodthirsty version of Dracula. Josh O’Connor, a lead in next year’s Steven Spielberg blockbuster Disclosure Day, will trace the downfall of a classical violinist who opts instead for a bruising life as a boxer in a rare revival of Clifford Odets’ Golden Boy.\n\nSo why do they do it? They’re both screen idols in demand and their agents have endless goodies lined up for them, yet they’d rather face the harsh glare of a follow spot.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nErivo & O’Connor\n\nJosh O’Connor Theo Wargo/Getty Images\n\nBoth Erivo and O’Connor are legitimate creatures of the stage and both tell me they miss it. They also say that it terrifies them. “It’s like running towards the fire,” Erivo says. “I’m doing Dracula because it scares the sh*t out of me,” they add.\n\nO’Connor says he wants to re-experience the danger of performing in front of a live audience where there’s “no safety net.”\n\nDuring a chat with him as he wraps on Spielberg’s picture, he chose the word that sums it all up: “It’s the fear. Actors love it.”\n\nErivo is now in London sinking her teeth into rehearsals with director Kip Williams for the 112 performances they will give at the Noel Coward Theatre over a 15-week season beginning February 4. Should they need to take a flight to attend awards shows across the pond, some dates have been blocked off.\n\nCynthia Erivo at the “Wicked: For Good” New York premiere Getty Images\n\nThe Tony winner and Oscar nominee was last on stage in the West End when they appeared with Harriet Walter in Phyllida Lloyd’s production of Henry IV, set in a prison, at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014. From there, Erivo headed to Broadway to play Celie in The Color Purple. They tell us that they’re using their own talon-like fingernails to play Bram Stoker’s vampire.\n\nTheir astonishing performance as Elphaba in Jon M. Chu’s two Wicked moves proves they have the stamina to command the stage of the Noel Coward, performing multiple roles. Erivo says they were convinced they could do it after seeing Sarah Snook play 26 different characters in The Picture of Dorian Gray on Broadway.\n\nBoth Dracula and Dorian Gray originated out of the Sydney Theatre Company and were directed by Williams. Producers Michael Cassel and Adam Kenwright are responsible for bringing them to London. Snook took The Picture of Dorian Gray to Broadway, and although no one’s saying so out loud, Dracula is likely going to rest in their sarcophagus and be transported to New York as well.\n\nSam Yates, who directed Andrew Scott in Vanya at the Old Vic and in New York, will begin rehearsals with O’Connor and the Golden Boy company as soon as The Crown, Challengers and God’s Own Country star completes red carpet duties for Disclosure Day, which opens June 12.\n\nO’Connor, currently seen in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, The Mastermind and The History of Sound, also needs to get into prizefighting shape for Golden Boy, which runs at the Almeida from September 8-October 31.\n\nSwinton & Oldman\n\nTilda Swinton Courtesy Royal Court\n\nElsewhere, Oscar-winning actors Tilda Swinton and Gary Oldman are both returning to their theatrical roots at the same address, the Royal Court in Sloane Square, to help celebrate its 70th anniversary.\n\nThe last time Swinton trod the boards was in Manfred Karger’s Man to Man for the play’s 1988 London premiere. It had transferred down from Edinburgh’s Traverse Theatre where it originated in 1987 with Swinton taking up the solo role of Ella Gericke, a German widow who, beginning in the 1930s, assumes the identity and work of Max, her deceased husband, to help her through years of tumultuous upheaval in her country. I saw her do it at the Royal Court and she was pretty remarkable; thrilling that Swinton has signed up to take the part on again with Man to Man‘s original creative team led by director Stephen Unwin.\n\nI’m curious to see if Swinton’s reemergence on stage encourages her to perform more in the theater. Don’t want to boast, but I’m going to anyway — I saw her perform a variety of roles opposite the likes of Judi Dench and Peggy Mount in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s legendary 1982-85 seasons at Stratford-upon-Avon and the Barbican, in Mother Courage and Her Children (with Dench and Zoë Wanamaker) and Measure for Measure (with Mount, Daniel Massey and Juliet Stevenson playing Isabella). Swinton had small and large roles in other plays that performed in the repertory.\n\nThe very last time Swinton took a bow was in Unwin’s production of Peter Handke’s The Long Way Round at the National Theatre 35 years ago. Having seen it, I can understand why she stayed away so long!\n\nMan to Man plays the Royal Court’s Jerwood Theatre Downstairs begins September 5. It will transfer to New York in spring 2027.\n\nGary Oldman Dan Doperalski/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty Images\n\nSlow Horses star Oldman precedes Swinton into the Jerwood Downstairs with Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape, which originated at the Royal Court in 1958. Oldman recently revived the one-man drama, in which he both starred in and directed, at York Theatre Royal last April and May.\n\nOldman performed in a series of plays at the Royal Court over a two-year period beginning in 1985, culminating in a breathtaking performance opposite Lesley Manville in Serious Money, Caryl Churchill’s ferocious takedown of high finance.\n\nKrapp’s Last Tape runs from May 8.\n\nChris Pine\n\nChris Pine and ‘Ivanov’ The Bridge Theatre\n\nChris Pine (Star Trek, Into the Woods) makes his London stage debut as Anton Chekhov’s angst-ridden Nikolai Ivanov in a new adaptation of Ivanov by Simon Stone running at the Bridge Theatre from July 4-September 19.\n\nSome folk I know rolled their eyes when they heard about Pine’s casting to play a man undone by his own malaise. But Pine’s a classically trained thespian who studied at UC Berkeley and Leeds University before undertaking further acting courses at ACT in San Francisco. I feel we shouldn’t disdain American screen actors who come here to tread our boards with serious intent. Although it’s true that some, more homegrown than Americans, do venture from screen to stage and it’s clear they haven’t the chops for it, still they rake in the money at the box office in any old slop, and audiences leave disappointed because the star from the telly was a dud. Tis’ not the season to name names.\n\nIvanov’s tricky to pull off so kudos to Pine for running towards the fire. By the way, my benchmark for Ivanov, gawd knows I’ve seen a few, is Ralph Fiennes who was luminous in a crackerjack production that Jonathan Kent directed at the Almeida in 1997 from a version by David Hare.\n\nIvanov plays the Bridge Theatre from July 4-September 19.\n\nRosamund Pike in ‘Inter Alia’ Mads Perch\n\nTom Stoppard had already approved the casting for the Old Vic’s revival of his 1993 masterpiece Arcadia before he died late last month. Carrie Cracknell’s now in rehearsals with a company that includes Isis Hainsworth, Seamus Dillane, Prasanna Puwanarajah, Leila Fazad, Fiona Button, Holly Godliman, Angus Cooper, Gabriel Akuwudike and William Lawlor. The story is that of a child prodigy and theories of literary scandal and scientific intrigue that moves between two eras.\n\nFelicity Kendal, Bill Nighy, Harriet Walter, Samuel West and Emma Fielding were in the original company at the National that Trevor Nunn directed. What an opening night that was!\n\nKendal, a Stoppard muse, can be seen currently in the playwright’s 1995 play Indian Ink directed by Jonathan Kent at Hampstead Theatre until January 31.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl, The Wheel of Time) reprises her star turn in the transfer of Suzie Miller’s searing legal drama Inter Alia from the National, where it was a sold-out hit, to Wyndham’s Theatre from March 19-June 20.\n\nPike is joined by Jamie Glover, who played her husband in the NT production directed by Justin Martin. It’s about a karaoke-loving Old Bailey judge who finds herself at the center of an ethical conundrum involving her college-age son.\n\nMiller’s other legal scorcher, Prima Facie, is going on tour. The one-woman drama, a soaraway success in London and on Broadway, saw Jodie Comer win Tony, Olivier, Evening Standard and all the silverware going for her portrait of an attorney who represents alleged sexual offenders and is herself raped. Play opens at Richmond Theatre, south west of London, on January 23 and then plays eight other dates from Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre to the Playhouse in Liverpool, wrapping there March 21.\n\nClint Dyer (Get Up, Stand Up!, Death of England Plays), the former National Theatre deputy artistic director and now an NT Artistic Associate, directs Aaron Pierre (The Morning Show, Lanterns, Rebel Ridge, The Underground Railroad) playing Randle P. McMurphy in the stage production of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest adapted by Dale Wasserman.\n\nAaron Pierre Peyton Fulford\n\nOlivier Award-winner Giles Terera (Hamilton, Rosmersholm, Othello), a frequent collaborator of Dyer’s, plays Dale Harding, the savviest patient in the psychiatric facility who initially locks horns with McMurphy. The play runs at the Old Vic from April 1-May 23. William Redfield (A New Leaf, Death Wish) played Harding in Milos Forman’s classic 1975 movie, and we all know Jack Nicholson took on McMurphy.\n\nI’m hearing of some cool casting ideas in the works for Nurse Ratched, who was played by Louise Fletcher in the film.\n\nDyer also directs Letitia Wright (Black Panther, Small Axe) in the UK premiere of Tracey Scott Wilson’s incendiary drama The Story, about a reporter who clashes with their editor (what’s new!) over a hot-button issue. Throw in some racism and journalistic ethics into the mix.\n\nLetitia Wright Jeff Spicer/Getty for Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nMarianne Elliott directs a major-league revival of Christopher Hampton’s Les Liasons Dangereuses from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ epistolary novel starring Lesley Manville, Monica Barbaro and Aidan Turner at the National from March 21-June 6.\n\nAlso National Theatre bound is the musical adaptation of the 2014 movie Pride written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus. They reunite for this new show, which has been developed by Warchus with Beresford writing the book and lyrics, with music by Christopher Nightingale, Josh Cohen and DJ Walde.\n\nLesley Manville and Aidan Turner in artwork for ‘Les Liasons Dangereuses’ National Theatre\n\nPride is inspired by the true tale of how a group known as “Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners” came to the aid of a Welsh pit village during the 1984 miner’s strike. The movie starred Ben Schnetzer, Andrew Scott, Imelda Staunton, Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, George MacKay, Dominic West, Monica Dolan and Liz White.\n\nThe musical plays the National’s Dorfman Theatre from June 11-September 12.\n\nHowever, the keenest amongst you should scoot off to Cardiff’s Sherman Theatre for Pride’s outta town world premiere from March 31 through April 18.\n\nHappy Valley’s Siobhan Finneran stars in J.B. Priestley’s great farce When We Are Married, which is on now at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Tim Sheader, until February 7. Finnegan’s joined by Samantha Spiro, Sophie Thompson, Tori Allen-Martin, Leo Wringer and Ron Cook.\n\n(L-R) Sophie Thompson, Siobhan Finneran and Samantha Spiro in ‘When We Are Married’ Johan Persson\n\nThe best ever production of When We Are Married starred Patricia Routledge, Timothy West, Prunella Scales, Brian Murphy, Bill Fraser, Patsy Rowlands and Patricia Hayes at the old Whitehall Theatre (now the Trafalgar) in 1985. Watching them was pure comedy gold.\n\nFollowing Finneran and company into the Donmar from February 14 is Anastasia Hille (The Bletchley Circle, A Gentleman in Moscow) and Erin Kellyman (28 Years Later, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) in the world premiere of Evening All Afternoon by Anna Ziegler (Photograph 51), about how a stepmother and her stepdaughter summon quiet courage “to open their hearts again.”\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor has been spotted at rehearsals in Clapham, South London for the Royal Shakespeare Company’s musical adaptation of The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, based on Ejiofor’s 2019 Netflix movie about how schoolboy William Kamkwamba, then aged 13, saved his village in Malawi from famine by devising a windmill from scratch to provide electricity to pump water and irrigate crops.\n\nEjiofor has been appointed the show’s creative associate and is on hand should director Lynette Linton, the cast and creatives require any guidance related to the story. Kenny Wax, who holds the West End rights, tells me that the cast, with Alistair Nwachukwu as William, have been “raising the roof” over at the RSC’s London rehearsal hall. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind opens at the RSC’s Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon on February 10 and runs through March 28. The show features book and lyrics by Richy Hughes and music and lyrics by Tim Sutton.\n\nIt then transfers to @sohoplace in the West End from April 25-July 18.\n\nAlistair Nwachukwu Dujonna\n\nNwachukwu was a member of the ensemble that performed in the excellent play The Line of Beauty, based on Alan Hollinghurst’s bestselling novel. It was directed by Michael Grandage and adapted by Jack Holden, who described it as a drama “about class and furniture.” Anyhow, there’s no word yet on when, where and casting, but it’s likely to transfer into the West End. Jasper Talbot, Leo Surer, Ellie Bamber, Arty Froushan, Charles Edwards, Claudia Harrison, Robert Portal and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers were at the top of their game when I caught the final Almeida performance.\n\nThe aforementioned Froushan will headline, as we reported here recently, a revised revival of the musical version of Bret Easton Ellis’ notorious novel American Psycho directed again by Rupert Goold. Show features a book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik. It runs at the Almeida from January 22-March 14.\n\nMore from the RSC: Kenneth Branagh returns to Stratford’s Royal Shakespeare Theatre to play Prospero in The Tempest, directed by Richard Eyre, with performances from May 13 through June 20.\n\nBranagh also appears with Academy Award-winning Helen Hunt making her RSC debut as Ranyevskaya in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard directed by Tamara Harvey from a new version by Laura Wade. A limited season at The Swan Theatre runs July 10-August 29.\n\nHelen Hunt\n\nMark Gatiss also debuts at the RSC in Bertolt Brecht’s The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, in a version by Stephen Sharkey that’s directed by Seán Linnen, also at The Swan, from April 11 through May 30.\n\nHigh Noon, adapted from the classic Western by Eric Roth, is in previews at the Harold Pinter Theatre with Billy Crudup and Denise Gough playing, and expanding, the roles played by Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly in Fred Zinnemann’s movie written by Carl Forman. Roth tells me it’s about “courage.”\n\nArthur Miller’s All My Sons is unmissable at Wyndham’s Theatre starring Bryan Cranston, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Glynn-Carney and Hayley Squires. The magnificent production directed by Ivo van Hove opened to rave notices a few weeks back, but it runs until March 7.\n\nAnd we delivered you the scoop on Sadie Sink (Stranger Things) and Noah Jupe (Hamnet) making their West End debuts in Romeo & Juliet directed by Robert Icke, which runs at the Harold Pinter Theatre beginning March 16 for a limited season until June 6. The full company rehearse late January.\n\nSadie Sink and Noah Jupe Helen Murray\n\nA tip: Theo Jamieson, musical director at the Royal Shakespeare Company, has written the book, music and lyrics for a new musical developed at the National Theatre Studio called Flyby. There’s talk of it heading to Southwark Theatre at some point next year starring Poppy Gilbert (Sherwood, Chloe). From what I’m hearing, Gilbert is a revelation.\n\nYou heard it here first.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:24:25.062328"}

Trump urged CBS to pull the plug on Colbert’s show “NOW” instead of ending its run next May.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Stephen Colbert is a pathetic trainwreck, with no talent or anything else necessary for show business success,” Trump wrote in a post at 12:16 a.m. ET on his Truth Social platform. “Now, after being terminated by CBS, but left out to dry, he has actually gotten worse, along with his nonexistent ratings. Stephen is running on hatred and fumes ~ A dead man walking! CBS should, ‘put him to sleep,’ NOW, it is the humanitarian thing to do!”\n\nSeven minutes later, Trump followed up with this: “Who has the worst Late Night host, CBS, ABC, or NBC??? They all have three things in common: High Salaries, No Talent, REALLY LOW RATINGS!”\n\nTrump also reiterated his call for the U.S. government to revoke TV broadcasters’ licenses. “If Network NEWSCASTS, and their Late Night Shows, are almost 100% Negative to President Donald J. Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party, shouldn’t their very valuable Broadcast Licenses be terminated? I say, YES!” Then, three minutes after that post, the president shared, “MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!”\n\nThe episode of “The Late Show” that CBS aired on Dec. 23 was a rerun, featuring guests Sigourney Weaver and Mandy Patinkin. It originally aired on Dec. 8 — and that night, Colbert took several shots at Trump, including his takeover of the Kennedy Center and his move to seize hosting duties at the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n“This year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony is the very first since Trump installed himself as chair of the Kennedy Center’s board,” Colbert said in his monologue, eliciting boos from the audience. In response, Colbert said, “Yeah, I kind of agree. It seems like the commander-in-chief shouldn’t have enough time to run a theater. ‘Mr. President, Mr. President, Russia has just launched another round of missiles. But first, dress rehearsal for ‘Oklahoma’ is underway, and the blocking is uninspired,'” Colbert joked.\n\nAt another point, Colbert admitted, “I don’t know how much effort I’m putting into the impression [of Trump] anymore. And I don’t care… Fire me!”\n\nColbert also played some of Trump’s remarks in which “he pre-complained about how people will judge his hosting” of the Kennedy Center Honors, according to Colbert. Trump had claimed that as the ceremony’s host, “Jimmy Kimmel was horrible…. If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be president.” To which Colbert quipped: “You can’t and you shouldn’t.”\n\nThen Colbert fact-checked Trump. “Just a quick brain check for Grandpa Puddin’ Skull: I called [Kimmel] and Jimmy Kimmel has never hosted the Kennedy Center Honors,” eliciting a huge laugh from the audience. “But here’s the thing: I did, the three years leading up to Trump becoming president.”\n\nIn the monologue, Colbert also made fun of Trump for receiving the “fake” inaugural FIFA Peace Prize award “after years of campaigning unsuccessfully for the Nobel Peace Prize.”\n\n“Later that same day, Trump also received the Hooters National Book Award,” Colbert joshed. “It was the breast of times, it was the worst of boobs.” The CBS host said Trump’s FIFA Peace Prize is “like for Christmas if you ask your mom for a Super Nintendo and she gets you something called ‘Super Retendo.’ It comes with ‘Super Marion Brothers’ and ‘Legend of Kelvin.'” Colbert said FIFA president Gianni Infantino “pulled on all the stops for Trump’s Big Boy Trophy Party,” adding that in a photo showing Trump picking up the medal Infantino awarded to him, the president “looks like a goblin asking if it’s OK to eat a third baby.”\n\nAfter CBS announced this summer that “The Late Show” would be ending in May 2026, Trump gloated that “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.” A few days later on the show, Colbert fired back, telling the president, “Go fuck yourself” (with the f-word censored).\n\nCBS, in announcing the cancellation of “The Late Show,” insisted the move was “purely a financial decision” that came after a years-long decline in the economics of late-night TV.\n\nIn its Dec. 23 broadcast of the Kennedy Center Honors, CBS did not refer to the place as the “Trump Kennedy Center,” largely because the ceremony was recorded before Trump’s name was screwed on to the building last week. CBS News’ standards department instructed staffers last week to maintain the original Kennedy Center name in their coverage, the Washington Post reported. “If the president or other administration officials use the new name in a soundbite that is their prerogative,” the news org said.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:48:17 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:55:18.276428"}

However, unlike her fictional stand-in, the grouchy romantasy author Carol Sturka, she did so without fear.\n\nGilligan has been forthright during the press rounds for the popular Apple TV show, now the streamer’s most-watched in history, that he penned the sprawling series with Better Call Saul’s shrewd Kim Wexler in mind. For Seehorn, it was equally a no-brainer.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“I think especially as women, we sometimes want to know exactly where you’re going to take the character, because what if we’re not going to really be used? What if the character won’t be allowed to evolve in any way? I already know he’s not going to do that,” she tells Deadline of the role.\n\nCarol is abrasive, challenging and deeply relatable. Despite being “extremely impulsive and extremely reactive,” her decisions are propelled by a deep sense of loss, righteous anger and, as Seehorn describes it, “passionate rage.” What drew the three-time Emmy nominee to the part even further wasn’t just the character’s “challenging” complexity, but also the content of the show, which makes legible philosophical queries that have plagued our species since inception.\n\nBelow, Seehorn chats about Carol’s intractable grief, the joys of creativity and why her character’s Season 1 finale decision is a “completely normal response to a breakup.”\n\nDEADLINE: First off, congratulations on the Golden Globe nomination — so well deserved. Creator Vince Gilligan has said he wrote this part for you, but aside from working with him again, what drew you to this character?\n\nRHEA SEEHORN: It literally just was Vince. Even if he didn’t write it for me, Vince just saying, ‘I have a project for you’ — because of his style of collaboration, the sets he creates, the department heads he surrounds himself with, the civility he conducts his sets with and then the writing itself is just the best foundation you’ll ever have to try to build a character. And I didn’t have any fear about it. He didn’t even tell me what it was going to be about. I had no idea. And I said, ‘It’s fine, just yes.’ And he said, ‘Well, no, you can wait and read it first.’ I said, ‘I don’t need to.’\n\nI think especially as women, we sometimes want to know exactly where you’re going to take the character, because what if we’re not going to really be used? What if the character won’t be allowed to evolve in any way? I already know he’s not going to do that. Then, once I got the script, I would imagine I had a similar reaction to many people who watched the pilot, which is, ‘This is bananas. What is happening, and where are we going from here?’ His scripts … have pace and tone in them, so you have that breathless journey as you do when you’re watching them; they’re really fun reads.\n\nAnd I also could see all these genres that he was playing with and then turning them on their ear. I could also see these tone shifts that then got even wilder in swings once we’re working on performing them. I was like, ‘Was that comedy that just happened in the middle of that horribly dark moment?’ I was like, ‘Wow, this is going to be challenging, and so much fun.’ And I just got really excited. And my first thought was, ‘Oh, this would be a show for me as a watcher.’ I’d be so excited about this show, plot-wise and character-wise, but then also the profound questions it brings up about what it means to be human.\n\nRhea Seehorn as Carol Sturka in ‘Pluribus’ (Apple TV)\n\nAs a creative person, probably the most horrifying idea is that you can’t create something new in this world. In the show, you have to balance the overwhelming loss that is catapulting all of Carol’s decisions, and the tightrope she walks between wanting answers, wanting to fix things, and inadvertently contributing to suffering in a world that is now devoid of it. Were those discussions something that you were exploring as you stepped into this world?\n\nVince wasn’t writing to a particular theme or a topic. Many people have felt like: Is this commentary on AI? Is this commentary on the pandemic lockdown, divisiveness in our country, zealotry of any kind, community versus the individual? And he wasn’t writing to any of those themes; he was writing about human nature, but he does live in the world we’re living in.\n\nI, too, believe that when I’m playing the part, Carol is not viewing this as a theoretical debate topic. She does not have the luxury of thinking about this philosophically. It’s only when it comes up practically as far as wrestling with the debate of, ‘Am I allowed to believe that these people really care about me? Do I really think these people are a threat? What kind of threat are they?’ So I wasn’t really looking at it in an ideological way either, but I certainly had some really fun late-night conversations with my crew on weekends, of just the questions it brings up. Not only what would you do, but how do you redefine the idea of love? Is true love only when it’s unique to you? And is there something wrong with me that I might appraise some art as high art and some art as low art, or real writing versus not real? What is that? As long as it makes one person happy, isn’t it all the same? Is there something wrong with me that I actually love to be competitive with myself, and that I always want to get better at every scene I do? I hope I become a better and better actor, but would I be OK if everybody was brilliant? I don’t know.\n\nAnd to your point, one of the biggest things for me, is the joy of being surprised by what others have created, whether it’s a book or a song or a play or someone else’s performance or art, a joke — to ever have a real belly gut laugh at something, again, necessitates surprise. But I suppose the others would argue: But they are in awe of everything; everything is beautiful.\n\nI don’t think it’s for me, though.\n\nManousos is both a parallel and a foil of sorts to Carol. They are driven by similar things, are stubborn and angry — very relatably so. But the way Carlos-Manuel Vesga put it was that Carol has everything but no purpose, and he has purpose but has nothing. I’m curious how you view that, or if you view it similarly.\n\nWas he speaking about Carol before [the Joining]?\n\nNo, after.\n\nI deeply disagree then.\n\nHow great is Carlos-Manuel though? We’re all a bunch of complete nerds that sit around talking about deep-dive script analysis of characters. It would bore anybody else to tears but Carlos-Manuel has definitive opinions about what the other characters are or think or are doing that sometimes we do not, and we have a very good time and a good laugh about debating him sometimes. He has not told me that one.\n\nCarol absolutely has purpose. He may have gone through the Darién Gap because of his purpose, but Carol, thinking that she needs to save the world, lifted a 500-pound gorilla called grief off her chest every single morning, and every glance out that window by the back kitchen sink, and every paver she put down, and no matter how exhausted she was [while] digging the grave for [her] own wife, gets back up; gets back up when she sees a barcode on the bag.\n\nCarlos-Manuel Vesga as Manousos Oviedo in ‘Pluribus’ (Apple TV)\n\nShe is addicted to having a purpose, in my opinion. Sure, it’s a distraction from the overwhelming feeling of being bereft and having lost everything but even her stuff with Zosia, when she capitulates to this relationship — someone had asked me earlier: Is the act of beginning to write another novel another distraction of playing house? I said, ‘No, to me, that’s the whole other love of her life, was her career and being a writer,’ and to have it completely taken away from you — there’s no one to write for anymore. When these people come and say, ‘Actually, no, you’re the only person in the whole world that could write a new book for us, and we are eagerly awaiting.’ And her little ego of, ‘I could have fans again,’ and the part of her that’s like, ‘There’s a reason for me to get out of bed and put pants on tomorrow?’ Even amidst this new love affair, she’s up and out of that bed. I know that feeling of having the 4:30 a.m. call, and no matter how early it is, you’re so happy to have the call.\n\nShe’s lacking [in] ways to get to her purpose, and is very, very impulsive and is very, very reactive, but yeah, he’s without purpose, that guy! Come on, you’re just gonna obliterate everybody? How’s that gonna save mankind?\n\nThey do both take the paths of most resistance — digging the grave, refusing to take a plane — so that does show persistence in going after something.\n\nThey’ve definitely met each other’s match in the department of being a stubborn ass.\n\nYou said Carol’s impulsive, which she totally is, but I also find that she is somewhat deliberate in that impulsivity. I read in an interview that you’re constantly thinking about why she’s doing what she’s doing, like, ‘Why is she choosing to sleep on the couch when she can sleep on the bed?’ There’s just so much going on in her brain, and she’s at war with herself. How do you view that, and how do you bring that to your performance?\n\nThe script analysis work I’m doing as an actor is where the ‘why’ comes in, so I’ve thought about: ‘Why did she fall asleep on the couch and fall asleep drinking?’ But Carol, in the moment, did it instinctively; it’s like hot coals to go up that staircase that early — ‘I couldn’t possibly look at her side of the bed.’ So when I’m playing her, and she’s very deliberate at times, I find her extremely impulsive and extremely reactive with a lot of passionate rage. And all of these things at times can be her superpower, but at times the biggest thing in our way is this behavior.\n\nSo even though I, as the actor, may try to think about what’s the ‘why’ that she did it, if I’m trying to play somebody who keeps acting impulsively and reactively, you then take out that transition. So even in our lives, when we have an impulsive reaction to something, if you were to go back and go like, ‘Why did I bark at that family member way too loudly when they commented on my dress?’ And then you go home and you realize, like, ‘Because there was someone else at the table that [is] always remarking on my clothes, and I picked this dress up specifically, and I had already gotten insulted that morning.’ And there was a ‘why,’ but you didn’t think about it at that moment; you just screamed at your cousin.\n\n(L-R): Rhea Seehorn and Karolina Wydra in the Season 1 finale of ‘Pluribus’ Apple TV\n\nOne of the things I wanted to wrap up with was, Carol almost goes on this circular journey from pilot to finale, where she comes back to her purpose, as we discussed. And there’s the atom bomb that she requests, which I loved so much.\n\n[Laughs] Completely normal response to a breakup, don’t you think?\n\nYeah, I wish I could do that. But if you could expand on or describe what’s going on in her head at that moment. Is it a bargaining chip? Is it a threat? Is it a sign of despair? Is it all of these things or none of these things?\n\nI’m not trying to be evasive, I actually think you nailed it. It is all of these things and none of these things. I went and asked Vince, like, ‘Do you know exactly what her plan is with it?’ And he said, ‘No.’ And I think he was being honest; I know they’re in the writers’ room now writing Season 2.\n\nNormally, I do supply my own reason, just so that my acting will have specificity to it. This was one of the rare cases where I thought: It is an impulsive, highly reactionary, highly angry, highly hurt decision. ‘I’m going to ask for the largest, most destructive, horrible thing I could, and I’ll figure out the rest later.’ I think it’s even more rash that she doesn’t have a plan. That’s my opinion.\n\nI think it’s just [that] she wanted to make a huge statement. And she’s so hurt and so angry and doesn’t know what to do and is so overwhelmed by the choices she’s been left [with]. I mean, for one, she’s got to go pair up with Machete Dude? I mean, seriously, that’s my only teammate now? Maybe Diabaté [played by Samba Schutte], if he stops having sex with them; at least I know he doesn’t want to be changed. She’s not super happy about the picks for her team for kickball, I could say that, so she gets an atom bomb! I kind of had fun with the delivery of that last line, too. Just kind of like: ‘I don’t need to explain to you why I got it; it’s an atom bomb, whatever.’\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for concision and clarity.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 17:05:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T17:26:20.196941"}

As episode co-writer and executive producer Alison Tatlock tells Deadline, it was inevitable that the duo’s first meeting “would have to start as a disaster.”\n\n“Because the timing is terrible,” she explains. “If it had happened a couple episodes earlier, maybe we’d have a different story, but by the time he gets there, she’s in a completely different headspace. We, in the script even, had a moment where we, in a stage direction, referred to her kind of vaguely remembering that she made videos where she was calling everyone into action; it’s not where her head is at anymore. And that’s when he shows up, expecting the Carol Sturka that he saw on the video, and that person is a little bit dormant right now.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFellow co-writer, EP and director of the episode, Gordon Smith, adds, “All those things that give grist to the mill were really fun to sort of tease out, and fun to see them not quite be the people that they even think of themselves. Carol thinks, ‘No, I am a hero. Oh, wait, this guy just walked 8,000 miles [sic] to be here. Maybe I haven’t done as much as I thought,’ and vice versa, I think.”\n\nVesga, a prolific Colombian actor who was cast in the role after being up against 710 people, points out the differing stakes between his character and Carol.\n\n“At least when it all starts, they see the enemy in the Joining. I am not sure if their reasons and their motivations are the same,” he says. “I think they come from very different worlds. You have Carol, who is a first-class citizen of the world, and you have Manousos, who’s probably a fifth-class citizen of the world, who is a migrant from Colombia to Paraguay, with all that comes with migrating and leaving your life behind and experiencing the trauma of just landing somewhere else new, losing your world. And then the small, little world that he’s managed to build in Paraguay is taken away from him, so his motivation is like, ‘Hell no, not this time, not again.’”\n\nFor Vesga, that means the two of them are approaching the problem of the Others in dichotomous ways.\n\n“Here’s a guy who has nothing in the world: no food, almost no clothes and yet he has purpose. And we cut from that guy and we go to Carol, who has, quote unquote, everything that she wants and has no purpose,” he says. “Rhea’s an amazing actor, but that one [scene], when she’s sitting in front of that firework, and she knows that it might kill her, and yet she stays there — that is one of the best performances I’ve ever seen. And I was thinking, ‘There is someone who has everything and is without a purpose.’ They seem to be trying to [get] to the same place, but they are going [about it] in a different way for different reasons.” (Editor’s note: Seehorn vehemently disagrees with this characterization, which you can read about here.)\n\nSeehorn and Vesga in the Season 1 finale of ‘Pluribus’ ( Apple TV\n\nAs Manousos and Carol struggle to communicate — because of their mutual unwillingness to cede ground, similar caustic personalities (and certainly a language barrier doesn’t help, though it does add to the scene earned levity) — the former crystallizes his concern: “Do you want to save the world, or save your girl?” The apt distillation of their conundrum (the episode is named “La Chica o El Mundo”) is drawn into focus after Carol fires off a warning shot at Manousos as he triggers a seizure in the Others, not unlike she did some episodes ago. After conducting quasi-scientific experiments on representatives of the Hive, he reaches the conclusion that the Joining can be reversed; but as the Others pack up to leave Manousos, Carol goes with them.\n\nAs Smith characterizes it, the ensuing idyllic montage is Carol’s last-ditch effort to “give in” to the collective.\n\n“That’s really the essence of what we wanted to make it feel like, and that journey was the most beautiful, placid [thing],” he says. “Carol’s giving herself this one chance to give in to the real temptation of the Others, which is, ‘Hey, the world’s beautiful. Come see it with us.’ Essentially, ‘Give in,’ and it needed, I think, for the fall at the end, to hit as hard as it can. Everything else needed to feel like it was just the best vacation, or best series of vacations, that you could possibly hope to take. So we tried to craft that — all of the sequence I feel like I was trying to make the transitions feel like they were gentle, and make the shooting feel like it was gentle.”\n\nCarol and Zosia stroll along sun-soaked beaches, take a bath in a luxurious Shanghai high-rise hotel and unwind with an après-ski evening in (all shot in Big Sky, Montana; as creator Vince Gilligan jokes, “They’re dressed for the beach, but they’re wearing galoshes to get through like a foot of snow and slush right outside the door.”) Just when this domestic serenity reaches its tipping point, Carol stumbles upon an alarming truth: The Others have located the eggs she had frozen with Helen years ago and are actively working on transforming them into stem cells, a process that can take as little as a month.\n\nTatlock says of the Others’ ethical justifications in the matter: “We talked about it a lot, like, ‘What do they do? What will they not do? What line will they cross? What line would they not cross?’ And we agreed that, while they would not force Carol physically to have a procedure that would extract her stem cells, if she had already voluntarily given up her eggs in a previous chapter of her life, which she did, that that would fall under the banner of, not consent, but that would be accessible to them, and that it would not break any ethical rule in their minds. Of course, to her, it feels like a hideous violation. So that’s where they part ways.”\n\nSmith recalls there were “various pitches on the table” as the creative team discussed how the Others would inevitably acquire Carol’s stem cells, given the collective’s “specific” understanding of agency.\n\nGilligan notes of the dubious governing rules of the Others’ morality: “But, maybe, if the eggs had already been fertilized, they wouldn’t have been able to, right? Because they can’t [actively interfere]. Boy, that opens up [a whole can of worms]. We talked many, many, many hours about this stuff. It’s a quagmire.”\n\nAll episodes of Pluribus are streaming on Apple TV.

Just months later, the 74-year-old actor found himself promoting three major studio projects: Mike Flanagan’s life-affirming fantasy drama “The Life of Chuck” (streaming Dec. 26 on Hulu), the adaptation of Stephen King’s “The Long Walk” and now “The SpongeBob Movie: Searching for SquarePants,” in which Hamill voices the ghoulish Flying Dutchman.\n\n“You can’t really control it, but this was a really, really active year,” Hamill tells Variety. “I don’t have anything lined up, so maybe next year won’t be so active.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHamill weighed the idea of retirement after reprising Luke Skywalker in the “Star Wars” sequel trilogy, wanting to hang up his cape while the going was still good. “As much as an actor appreciates a good entrance,” he says, “you want to find a way to end your career in a way where you can hold your head high.”\n\n\n\nThat outlook shifted when Mike Flanagan offered him a part in “The Fall of the House of Usher,” which reignited his excitement for the craft. “It was a character part that would’ve been routine in voiceover,” Hamill said. “In voiceover, they don’t care what you look like, so you’re going to play many roles you’d never get on camera. They cast with their ears, not their eyes.”\n\n\n\nNow firmly in his third act, voice acting has allowed Hamill to keep playing those juicy roles untethered from age or physicality. But as AI reshapes Hollywood, he remains wary of how his legacy — especially in future Disney’s “Star Wars” projects — will live on. “It’s hard to predict the future,” Hamill says, “but I may have to ask my family if they want me in a Star Wars movie 30 years from now after I’m gone.”\n\n\n\nWith Variety, Hamill discusses his approach to the Flying Dutchman, moving on from “Star Wars,” and why he quit Facebook.\n\nYou’ve had quite the year.\n\n\n\nYeah. When it rains, it pours.\n\n\n\nHow are you reflecting on the year as a whole? The Palisades fire in January, all these big movies — it’s been a lot of ups and downs.\n\nIt’s remarkable. I’m in the business of escapism, and if I can take people’s minds off the horrible headlines — especially for those affected by the fires — then I’ve done my job. A lot of things are unexpected. I did a show years ago called “Regular Show.” It has a cult following, but it ran for eight seasons. I’ve never been on a show that comes back. We did 40 new episodes, and they want to do 40 more.\n\n\n\nBefore “The SpongeBob Movie” starts, there’s this five-minute “Ninja Turtles” short that plays. Did you see it?\n\n\n\nI did.\n\n\n\nIt pokes fun at society’s over-reliance on ChatGPT. Has it been unsettling seeing AI-generated videos of you or Luke Skywalker? I saw one the other week of Luke talking to Ben Kenobi’s Force Ghost and couldn’t believe how realistic it looked.\n\nI haven’t seen that. Is it live-action or animated?\n\n\n\nIt’s live-action. It plays like a deleted scene from “Return of the Jedi.”\n\nGee, I haven’t seen that. It’s one of those things where there’s a disconnect between the fan world and myself, in the sense that every actor does the job, and when the job is completed, they move on to the next project. They don’t really hang on to it. And yet, “Star Wars” is such a vital ongoing franchise. [Disney] is doing really well, and obviously, they’ve done more material since I left. But I had my time. Now I’m just a fan. I love “Rogue One,” “Mandalorian,” “Andor.” They’re doing great without me.\n\n\n\nDisney has a new partnership with OpenAI, where fans will now be able to generate short videos using characters from the “Star Wars” universe. How does that sit with you?\n\nIt’s fascinating to see it develop, and I’m also apprehensive about how it will be used. The story of the AI-generated actress that got signed by a major agency is mind-boggling. Is she going to stay 33, or whatever her age is, forever? It’s obviously hard to predict the future, but I guess I’m gonna have to talk to my family about if they want me to be in a “Star Wars” movie 30 years from now after I’m gone.\n\n\n\nIt’s cool to hear you lend your voice to The Flying Dutchman. How did you approach that iconic laugh, especially given comparisons to the Joker?\n\nWhen I accepted the offer to be the Flying Dutchman, I thought it was a new character created just for this movie. I start to do my homework, and it’s a character that’s been done for years by Brian Doyle-Murray. I’ve been a fan of his since “Saturday Night Live.” I loved him on Chris Elliott’s show “Get a Life.” He’s just terrific. But I was too intimidated to listen to what he had done. I thought I’d better do my version, and I’ll listen to his later. With a character like a ghost pirate in the world of “SpongeBob,” you can go as big as you want. It’s like children’s theater. There is no too big.\n\nIn terms of the Joker, when you’re in the head of the character, I didn’t see the parallels. Now that I’m sort of distanced from it, I can see how people find comparisons between the two. I love both characters in different ways, and they’re both fun to play.\n\n\n\nCertain actors choose the route of retirement, but you’ve stayed incredibly active. Do you think you could retire?\n\nA few years ago, I started thinking, “I’ve done a lot, maybe it’s time to make a dignified exit.” As much as an actor appreciates a good entrance, you want to find a way to end your career in a way where you can hold your head high. The real turning point for me was meeting Trevor Macy and Mike Flanagan about “The Fall of the House of Usher.” That made me excited about performing again because it was a character part that would’ve been routine in voiceover. In voiceover, they don’t care what you look like, so you’re going to play many roles you’d never get on camera. They cast with their ears, not their eyes.\n\nYou can’t really control it, but this was a really, really active year. I don’t have anything lined up, so maybe next year won’t be so active. When you’re in your 20s and 30s, it’s hard to think of yourself in your 50s and 60s, but I certainly didn’t think I’d be on camera as long as I’ve been.\n\n\n\nAre there any dreams you haven’t achieved yet?\n\nI wanted to go to Broadway, I did that. I’ve wanted to do animation ever since I found out that people did animated voices. In grade school, I saw Clarence Nash do Donald Duck on a Walt Disney show, and I really zeroed in on all my favorite shows. I learned who Mel Blanc was. I loved “Rocky and Bullwinkle.” I’d go to the record stores to look at the back of the record albums to write down the names of the actors — because we didn’t have the internet, you couldn’t Google it. It was something I aspired to.\n\nIt’s a very unique job, and doing the Flying Dutchman is one of the reasons I love being an actor. And the fact that I got to play it in live-action segments. I mean, it was crazy fun. If people have even a fraction of the good time that I’m having doing this character, they’re in for the time of their lives.\n\nThey say in the movie that SpongeBob has the purest heart of an innocent. Before SpongeBob, that was Luke Skywalker for a lot of people. What gravitates you towards these optimistic characters?\n\nI never forget the fact that we are in the business of escapism. These are troubled times. The movie is therapeutic in that regard. You go to something like “The SpongeBob Movie,” you leave all your troubles behind. It’s healthy in troubling times to have an escape.\n\nGeorge Lucas mastered that escapism, but at its core, “Star Wars” is a very anti-authoritarian story.\n\nWell, that’s the thing. It’ll work on different levels, depending on your age. And you’re right about George. The original “Star Wars” was an allegory commenting on the Vietnam War. So there’s the resistance, the rebels, the Empire. It’s surprisingly relevant when you consider what’s going on in our country today.\n\nYou’re in the business of entertainment, but you’ve also stayed very connected to politics and charities. Why is that important to you?\n\nIf you’ve been lucky enough to be able to do what you love and make a living at it, you have a responsibility to pay back as best you can. That’s why I love Make-A-Wish, and that’s what I use social media for. I’m not really overtly political on talk shows, but more so on Bluesky and Instagram. I left Twitter the day after the election because I didn’t want to support anything that Elon Musk is involved in. I left Facebook in 2016 because I didn’t like the way Zuckerberg handled Hillary. But who cares that I left Facebook? It’s a real lesson that you’re only one voice in a country of over 300 million. So, get a grip and don’t take yourself too seriously.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 17:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T17:44:06.474573"}

She considers all 15 of those records to be reflective of where she was in the year leading up to the season, and the fact that home-and-hearth look a little different for her in 2025 is duly reflected in “Christmas Unhinged.”\n\nThe title of this year’s release is a reference to Hinge, which has been Chan’s post-divorce dating app of choice this past year. She could have gone with something a little cornier, because, as she jokes, “This chapter is called ‘Single Bells, Single All the Way.'”\n\nIn all seriousness, Chan says, “I felt like I could really speak to everyone that listens to my Christmas music and Christmas music lovers everywhere to understand what kind of Christmas I was having this year, and why it’s OK to live Christmas not just in, like, a snow globe of time, but as an actual living, lived experience.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPerhaps you’re familiar with Chan for the legend that has built up around her as the only artist of note to have devoted her recorded output exclusively to Christmas music, which was a hot take a decade ago, let alone 15 years into her unbroken streak. Or perhaps you became aware of her as the artist who put up a challenge to Mariah Carey, and prevailed; Carey attempted to trademark the term “Queen of Christmas,” and Chan went to court to block it, contending that she had also been using it or had it applied to her going back as many or more years. (Carey eventually stopped further action in the trademark pursuit, leading the judge to dismiss it and leave the slogan in the public domain.) If you’re unfamiliar with any of those parts of Chan’s story, you can retrace the footprints through the snow via previous Variety articles, including this origin story.\n\nBut for 2025, we had a very-late-in-the-season catchup with Chan about whether “Christmas Unhinged” is officially a divorce album, and what it’s been like to return the dating field and eventually have to explain to all possible suitors just what it is that she’s known for.\n\nThe answer might be evident to anyone who knows you, but the question is: Why put out a Christmas album that reflects your divorce?\n\nThis is definitely new emotional territory for me. But if you step back and look at all 15 chapters of my life in Christmas music, what makes my Christmas music so distinctive is that at the end of the year where we’re all taking inventory of where we are in our milestones of living, I curate my albums to capture the snapshot of where I am. And if I’m getting divorced, there are millions of other people just like me, who are facing the holidays without their spouse or without their family members as they know it, or their traditions have been upended. I’m not the only one. So it’s a tremendous honor to be able to create the kind of Christmas songs that are lacking if we only hold onto “A Holly Jolly Christmas.” I can grow with my Christmas canon and share some songs that might inspire others to embrace all of the holiday season — the good, the bad and the unknown.\n\nWould you go so far as to call this your Christmas divorce record?\n\nI think that last year was more my Christmas divorce record, with the album I called “Shatterproof.” I actually filed for divorce last year and I was going through so much internal turmoil, but I wasn’t ready to share it all yet. I processed the impending end of my marriage in the last album as safely as I could process it. I only do Christmas music, but this is how I process my emotions as an artist; it’s very cathartic to me. “Christmas Unhinged” is what happens once I decided to be divorced and embark on rediscovering myself, not focusing so much on the pain of divorce, but the opportunity of becoming who I’m meant to be in the second act of my life. As a single mom, it’s a beautiful thing. You know, divorce starts very sad, but there’s so much opportunity, because once you’ve been so down, the only place you can go is up, and I’ve never felt more myself in many years than I do right now.\n\nYou have talked on your social media about what it’s like to date now as the self-proclaimed Queen of Christmas and how men react to that.\n\nEspecially while I was dating people during the beginning of the Christmas season, which is around September, I started to get really nervous, because this is when I cannot hide this aspect of my life. First of all, I have not even dated in 20 years. So when I had to start even contemplating going out on dates again, and then downloading an app, going through hundreds and hundreds of random pictures and trying to decide, “Hey, do I wanna date you, Random Picture?,” it’s the weirdest thing in the whole world, right? And I got very, very frustrated in the process. So I ended up writing a non-Christmas song called “Love Me Right or Leave Me Alone,” which is sincerely my Hinge-dating mission-status song.\n\nAlso, I did a Beatles cover on this record, “Something,” because I feel like there wasn’t a proper female version of that song. And as I was meeting new guys and going on all these dates, I’d be like, “Oh yeah, there’s something about him.” And then I sang it for myself and I put it on Hinge as my mating call.\n\nYou got your Beatles on with this record, doubly, because you also covered John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” which you retitled “Happy Ex-mas.”\n\nI do covers only if they transform in the way that I relate to lyrics. When I got divorced, I started to really think about the lyrics to that song, and the one lyric that really helped me in the studio get through all of my pain of divorce was the lyric “War is over if you want it.” Right when you’re in the middle of a divorce, those words are so powerful. And so that is really a message to my ex-husband. Which is not the original intent of the song. But having sung it the way that I did and even retitling it “Happy Ex-Mas” — sorry, Yoko, if you’re not happy about that! — the way that it came out was super cathartic.\n\nGoing back to your dating experiences this year, what was it like to tell people what you are famous for?\n\nI’ve dated tons of different types of people from all ethnicities and creeds and cultures, and they get to know me as Elizabeth, and they’ll connect with me if they’re also going through divorce or if they’re single parents. But sometimes the minute that they find out I’m the queen of Christmas, it’s like a needle drops. It’s like, “What does this mean? Do you know I’m Jewish?” or something like that, and I’m like, yeah, it doesn’t matter. But it can become very challenging to people. It’s just been pure comedy.\n\nMaybe they imagine it’s like the Tim Allen movie, and they think they will date you and then they suddenly turn into Santa Claus and grow a big beard and belly.\n\nI feel like the only person who would’ve really tolerated that would’ve been the Mormon potato farmer that I dated. I don’t know how I found this guy in New York. He would’ve been OK with turning into Santa, I’m pretty sure. I went on a coffee date with a Hare Krishna…\n\nI was gonna ask if you had run into any Christmas fetishists who might be really turned on by that part of you.\n\nThere was a request from somebody who was really convinced that I should expand into Christmas OnlyFans. And I knew very quickly that this guy was not the guy for me. So yes, I encountered that guy. It was a very awkward conversation because I think he was quite serious about it.\n\nYou make it sound, though, like you’ve had fun this year, going through that process, as confounding as it is to someone coming back into the dating world in the age of apps.\n\nI have to step back and laugh because the whole ridiculousness of dating in this day and age is so unlike how I remember dating back in the day, where you would go to a bar and then maybe get someone’s number and start dating, and then it was just that person until it faded out. Now it doesn’t even feel like dating; it feels like a messed-up video game. The worst term we had back then was fading out on somebody. Now we’ve got rostering, we’ve got ghosting, we have submarining, we have breadcrumbing, we have all kinds of stuff. You know how in Alaska they have a thousand names for snow? In dating, there’s a thousand names for disinterest.\n\nWait, you are going to have to explain some of these terms, to someone who is not out in the field. “Ghosting” I get, but what were some of the others you mentioned?\n\n“Rosters” means when people have more than one person that they date casually… “Submarining” is not quite ghosting, which is where someone just completely goes like the Ghost of Christmas Past on you and they just disappear and there’s no explanation. Submarining is when they kind of go down into the depths of the ocean and you have no idea where they are, and then like maybe a week later or two weeks later, they come back up. It’s like, “Hey, what’s up? I was just down in the ocean. Sorry I couldn’t talk to you. I was in the abyss.”\n\nTimes have indeed changed…\n\nAnd a lot of these profiles are AI-generated. I might be falling in love with robots.\n\nBack on the music: Do you ever consider taking a year off between Christmas albums? Or would that ruin what you’ve got going?\n\nNever. What, you’re asking me now, 15 years in? You could have asked me this eight years in.\n\nJust wondering if it’s ever been a temptation to skip a year, or like in college, taking a gap year.\n\nI think the closest thing to a gap year that I had was when I broke my spine and I couldn’t sing. I had a meeting with my musicians and my co-producers and managers and I let them know that I physically could not stand because I was paralyzed from the left leg down. and I couldn’t even breathe. I had no stability of my diaphragm because I had broken my L1 to L5. I was crying and my daughter was sitting next to me and she was like, “No, mommy, I’m gonna help you sing.” And then my friend Dave Eggar, when I floated around that maybe that might be the year that I wouldn’t be able to do something, was like, “There’s no way.” We always figure it out. So my team around me reminds me, “No, Elizabeth, you have a greater purpose. You must tell your story every Christmas.” I really owe it to my friends in this business who remind me that at the end of the day, I’m an artist, and as an artist, my perspective informs my inspiration, and my inspiration is through my Christmas music. They constantly remind me that what I do is very different, and they’ll hold that space for me and remind me that you’re not allowed to not celebrate a Christmas.\n\nIt’s like me asking you: Are you gonna skip a Christmas this year? Have you ever skipped a Christmas?\n\nYou know, I have not.\n\nNo. Right? So why would I? I mean, I know I do a little extra than you do, but I’m not gonna not celebrate Christmas, and the way that I celebrate Christmas is just the way that I celebrate it, is like, you know, producing new songs and coming up with new albums and presenting them to the world and telling my story one Christmas at a time. Why would I not want to do that?\n\nI got behind in thinking about the season, and I did not put any lights up till the 22nd this year, but I feel like this conversation has helped me round a corner.\n\nSee, my magic powers prevail. I’m sure that you know if you need some Christmas backup, all you have to do is call and ask. I am the Queen of Christmas. Like, I know some people.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:09:57 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T18:39:09.540099"}

No theme rings more true than in Ariel Mahler’s short film Re-Entry, a masterclass character study that artfully weaves the tender and cerebral in a tale of reconciliation with past regrets and the overwhelming power of self-love. The story follows a transgender NASA scientist, Maya (Danielle Squyres), who rediscovers a lost satellite she launched 35 years earlier. Though excited by the potential recovery of the satellite, Maya finds herself still haunted by the memory of her painful, closeted past (younger Maya, played by Tirosh Schneider) and what she perceives to be the humiliating end of her career.

Then, what’ll happen even more decades later, the satellite will reemerge and essentially come back to life and start communicating again, hence the zombie satellite name. So, when I was looking at this video, it had a real emotional impact on me because it was a language that resonated with me as a trans person. The TikToker was talking about these satellites floating, lost in the wrong orbit, searching for the ability to communicate after they’ve lost it, and then something happens where they’re able to reemerge and begin communicating again. They find their orbit and their orientation. And, I was just like, “Yep, that tracks. I’ve had all of those experiences in my own personal life.”\n\nSo, when I saw this video, I imagined that it would be like creating a character who lives as a metaphor for the satellite. This trans woman, who has for a long time felt like she’s lost in the wrong orbit, is floating, searching for her community, when something inspires her to re-engage and re-enter her own life, essentially. Re-Entry is a story about reconciling with your past and making terms with who you once were, as it impacts who you are now. And I think that everybody probably can relate to the experience of thinking about your past and thinking about choices you made or things you did or things you didn’t do that impact who you are today, and that you maybe regret or you have complicated feelings about. And for queer and trans people, we tend to have a very complicated relationship with our past. So, I wanted to use this metaphor as a vehicle to explore our relationship with the past and how we integrate it.\n\nDEADLINE: What were some cinematic influences for your short?\n\nMAHLER: One of my favorite genres is emotional sci-fi films. Some of the biggest reference points for me are Arrival, Contact and Interstellar. They are all films that use science as a vehicle to tell a deep, emotional story about whatever situation the character is facing. So, me and my cinematographer watched those.\n\nDEADLINE: I’m fascinated by the way you tell the story. You have two different actors playing the same character: one, the younger male presenting version of Maya, and the other, the older version of Maya. Talk a bit more about this concept of both of them being in communication with each other onscreen.\n\nMAHLER: It wasn’t always that way. In the creative writing process, I struggled with [how to convey inner turmoil]. I knew the story’s foundation was an older trans woman who rediscovers a satellite she helped launch and is now forced to decide, “Do I return to NASA as my new self?” So, I knew that there had to be another person involved in that because I didn’t want her to just be alone wandering around having this monologue. So, I really struggled with who is the best person to bring into this world and to interrupt the status quo of how she lives her life. There was a version where her coworker, George (Robert Dowdy/Leon A. Walker), came in much earlier, and it was actually him who showed up and said, “Hey, we found the satellite.” And then she had to deal with, “Do I out myself to him? How does this go?” There was a version where it was a young NASA intern who came over to try to get her to come back to NASA. There were all these different versions of it.\n\nAnd then I was thinking about, I want this to be the most coherent and specific conflict possible. So, who is Maya actually struggling with? Who is she most at odds with? And I realized, oh, it’s herself. And then I also realized, oh, this is a film, so I can sort of bend reality a little. Not too much, but realistic enough to tell this story. So, the idea of bringing her former self back evolved through that very slow process. It was something I was a little nervous about at first because I think a lot of trans people tend to have complicated relationships with our past, as I said earlier. One of those complexities is that it can be hard to reckon with former versions of ourselves. Trans people sometimes even use the phrase dead name to refer to their former self as if their previous self is literally dead. I’ve always struggled with that because on one hand, I understand that. Looking at old photos of myself, I found it challenging and struggled to a certain extent.\n\nBut on the other hand, I actually have a lot of love and compassion for my younger self, because I think about it as, “They were just trying to do the best they could in a world that was telling them they had to be a very specific type of person.” I remember that the idea of putting the characters face-to-face felt scary, but it was also another reason why I was like, that means it’s the right thing to do, because if I’m afraid of it, I’m a bit like, this is risky, then that feels like exactly the right place to go.\n\nRe-Entry AFI / Ariel Mahler\n\nDEADLINE: How much of this short film is you?\n\nMAHLER: I’ll answer this first by going back to the film at hand. When I decided to bring the younger Maya into the world, I struggled. I was really trying to figure out who was going to go back to NASA and who was anti-going back to NASA. Originally, it was flipped from the film version. Older Maya was the one who was like, “I found the data, I want to go back,” and younger Maya was like, “No, you can’t. You can’t let them see you like this.” Then that was the push-and-pull dynamic, but it flipped. The reason that this feels relevant to your question, I think, is part of the challenge and also catharsis of making this movie is that it was a messy process. It’s messy to think about my past. On one hand, I want to grab the former me and shake them by the shoulders and be like, “What are you doing? Stop lying to everybody. Stop lying to yourself. Take control of your destiny. It’s not worth spending all of this time being miserable.”\n\nThere’s also some anger that I feel towards my younger self and love, shame, empathy and just the whole rainbow of human emotions. When a film is so deeply personal, it can be really challenging to drill down into the core thing [you’re trying to communicate]. Because it’s a short film, I only have 15 minutes to say one very specific thing, and there’s so much that I could say on this topic. Trying to nail down one specific thing made it really challenging but energizing.\n\nThe other piece that feels relevant to your question is my journey as a filmmaker. This is obviously a very trans story with a trans narrative, but, as a storyteller, it’s also important to me to tell stories that are not “just trans.” I never want it to be where the only conflict is coming out, or the only conflict is trans identity. So, for this short film, putting Maya in the realm of this scientific world was meaningful to me because she’s not just trans, she’s a scientist. She’s a NASA astronomer. She has a whole career that she’s been working her entire life for.\n\nIn the same way that I’m not just trans, I’m a filmmaker and an artist, and I have a career I’m building. So those two things feel deeply connected. But when I think about past me, I’m thinking about it in relation to my gender. I’m also thinking about the regrets I have. I knew I wanted to be a filmmaker when I was four years old, stealing my dad’s camcorder and making dumb little movies with my friends, yet I was afraid to embrace it fully. I was like, “Well, that’s not practical,” throughout high school and college. I opted to be more traditional. Then it wasn’t until I was almost 30 that I really embraced filmmaking. So, I look at former me and think about where my career would probably be now, if I had started back in high school or whatever.\n\nDEADLINE: How did you find your two leads in younger and older Maya?\n\nMAHLER: It was a very interesting challenge that I set up for myself, because I knew that I, one, had to cast a trans woman as a lead, and two, someone who was at least 50 years old, plus, because authentic casting is really important to me. But, unfortunately, there just aren’t a lot of visible older trans women actresses. And this isn’t because they aren’t out there, but because they just haven’t really been given the opportunity to get work or be seen. So, thankfully, Danielle Squyres was part of an acting group in LA called ActNOW, which is a program for queer and trans people. I have some friends who are also involved in that, and one of them, my friend Sasha Forests, knew Danielle and connected us. So, I brought her in for the audition process, and I knew she was the one. She has a really beautiful subtlety and was also really able to capture that external shell. But then, inside, you can sense the vulnerability and rawness.\n\nFor younger Maya, that was a new challenge, because I cast Danielle first, so I needed to find someone who vaguely resembled her. It was still about authenticity casting; I wanted somebody who had at least some personal understanding of queer and trans identity. So, I didn’t just want to necessarily cast a straight cisgender man who has no personal experience with that, but at the same time, I didn’t fully want to cast a trans woman and ask her to completely detransition herself for this student film. So, I was like, “How do I balance this?” Thankfully, I met Tirosh [Schneider] through a mutual friend, and they identify as non-binary and gender queer. They were comfortable presenting as a male at the time but are very much in the queer world and know what the experience of feeling othered by your gender is like, so that felt important.\n\nAlso, I do think, from a spiritual perspective, once you begin the journey of making a film, there’s a call in the universe, or God, or whoever you pull your power from, that magic conspires to put all the pieces into place. And the fact that I met Danielle, Tirosh and Robert, who plays George, all these people came into my life at the exact moment when I needed to find them. It was a beautiful experience.\n\nRe-Entry AFI/Ariel Mahler\n\nDEADLINE: You’ve shown this film on the festival circuit. What has the reception been like so far?\n\nMAHLER: We’ve been lucky and have had great feedback. We’ve been going to festivals for a year and a half now, which is awesome and exciting. The most meaningful thing to me is when specifically trans people come up to me and feel really seen by this story, because I do think that anytime you’re putting something out that is vulnerable, there’s a bit of fear. I didn’t know how trans people were going to respond to this younger self idea of putting a physical form of this woman’s younger [male-presenting] self. And a lot of the trans people that I’ve spoken to feel really seen and emotionally resonant with that story, so that means a lot. We’ve also been able to screen it for some students and young people, and having younger trans folks come up to me and say they were touched by and appreciate this story is meaningful to me because I never had that when I was young.\n\nDEADLINE: What would you like people to take away from this short?\n\nMAHLER: For me, I’ve learned that I would often go back in order to move forward. We have to look backwards and engage with our past. Engaging with the past can be scary, uncomfortable and vulnerable, but that’s exactly why we have to face that hard truth. It’s only through actively engaging with our past and making terms with our journey that we’re able to move forward.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:34:16 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T18:39:10.107372"}

A memo doubling down on a controversial decision that has roiled the Paramount Skydance news unit and drawn torrents of criticism.\n\nIn a note to staff sent hours before the start of Christmas Eve, CBS News Editor in Chief Bari Weiss, President Tom Cibrowski and new senior editors Charles Forelle and Adam Rubenstein insisted a move to delay a “60 Minutes” report by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi was enacted “to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.” The signatures on the memo mark what is believed to be the first tacit appearance of a new CBS News editorial “masthead” that Weiss expects to get more entrenched in the newsgathering process at the company, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n“Right now, the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press. It isn’t because they’re crazy,” the memo read. “To win back their trust, we have to work hard. Sometimes that means doing more legwork. Sometimes it means telling unexpected stories. Sometimes it means training our attention on topics that have been overlooked or misconstrued. And sometimes it means holding a piece about an important subject to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCBS News revealed over the weekend that a “60 Minutes” segment reported by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi and centered on the on-screen accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to prison in El Salvador had been shelved just hours before Sunday’s broadcast. As disclosed by an email sent to colleagues by Alfonsi, the decision was made by Weiss, who insisted that Trump officials appear in the report to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi’s team had made good faith efforts to secure response ahead of filing the report for legal review. “The public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” Alfonsi said in her memo.\n\nWeiss has, since her arrival in October, insisted without presenting evidence that mainstream media has lost Americans’ trust. And yet, a September study from Pew Research Center showed that CBS News enjoyed the backing of 51% of U.S. adults who have at least some trust in the information they get from national news organizations. CBS was ranked on par with CNN and PBS, and just a few percentage points behind ABC News and NBC News.\n\n\n\nSuch decision making ” may seem radical,” the new memo said. “Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week. And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”\n\nThe “60 Minutes” imbroglio grips CBS News and its parent at an extremely inopportune moment. The news unit is just days away from trying to launch Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of “CBS Evening News,” and looks to be doing so without the weeks of pre-launch promotion such a move would normally warrant. Instead, Dokoupil will go on a barnstorming tour of the U.S. and visit many cities and towns during his first days on the air. What’s more, Paramount is engaged in a heated battle with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and a continuing series of gaffes under Weiss’ management casts a cloud over Paramount CEO David Ellison’s ability to manage the coropration.\n\nMany staffers are aghast over Weiss decision, noting that it came at the end of a long vetting process and after CBS News had already promoted the “60 Minutes” segment to the public. Indeed, many people have been able to watch the report on their own because a Canadian media outlet which airs “60 Minutes” made Alfonsi’s report available via digital means. Should a new version of the story surface on the newsmagazine, viewers will be able to see how it was changed under Weiss’ supervision. According to people familiar with the report, Alfonsi had already made efforts to seek comment from Trump officials, and had included a video snippet from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that offered the administration’s take on the topic.\n\n\n\nMore to come….", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 19:38:05 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T19:40:45.304377"}

I love Carol’s abrasiveness. I love how she responds to the end of the world not with high-minded heroism, but a self-centered defiance rooted in grief — a solipsism encouraged by how the hive mind caters to her every request. I love how Carol is tough enough to spend over a month on her own when the hive mind abandons Albuquerque rather than endure Carol’s efforts to undo their joining, but human enough to relent and give acquiescence a try in the season finale. (Humanity and its attendant flaws are in scarce supply in “Pluribus.”) I believe Carol is a truly great TV character, brought to life by a truly great TV actor in Rhea Seehorn.\n\nNot everyone seems to agree. “Pluribus” is the third series from Vince Gilligan, the showrunner who earned himself a permanent place in his chosen medium’s Mount Rushmore with the back-to-back triumphs of “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul.” Both those series focused on ascendant figures in New Mexico’s narcotics trade, an exciting hook that belied Gilligan’s evident fascination with the detailed gruntwork between violent confrontations. I always think of Jonathan Banks’s Mike Ehrmantraut silently disassembling his car, part by individual part, in search of a tracker over several minutes of screentime in an early season of “Saul.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nApple’s largesse allows “Pluribus” to expand Gilligan’s purview to Las Vegas, South America and other far-flung locales, but also practice his preferred MO with a heightened focus. “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” — particularly the latter — could be rigorous, but they also distributed that rigor across a wide-ranging ensemble. In her Gilligan-verse debut, Seehorn’s Kim Wexler was just one of many fastidious obsessives in and around the Albuquerque underworld, joining kindred spirits like Mike and chicken-slash-meth kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). In “Pluribus,” Carol and the hive mind are pretty much all we have, give or take a few fellow survivors like gleeful hedonist Mr. Diabaté (Samba Schutte) and Manousos Oviedo (Carlos-Manuel Vesga), who spends much of Season 1 holed up in a Paraguayan storage facility.\n\nThat puts pressure on both Carol as audience surrogate and the viewer asked to train their attention on a single person’s response to a global cataclysm. Lengthy scenes show Carol doggedly investigating the hive’s source of nutrition (Human Derived Protein, which is exactly what it sounds like), or Manousos studying radio frequencies and noting his findings by hand. Especially in the hive’s absence, “Pluribus” is quiet, deliberate, patient — and for some, those qualities cross the line into “boring.” Writing for The New Republic, critic Philip Maciak pronounced the show “a bit of a snooze,” echoing many complaints on social media about the hive’s noisy, chaotic genesis giving way to the placidity of a status quo where almost everyone is quite literally of one mind.\n\nClearly, I disagree. I can point to certain objective factors in Gilligan’s defense: “Pluribus” balances out the indulgence of languid scene-to-scene pacing with sub-50 minute runtimes and a nine-episode season; the show’s visual panache works against a sense of monotony, like a dumpster-diving sequence directed by frequent Gilligan collaborator Gordon Smith that gives the grossest of tasks uncanny color and symmetry. (Cinematographers Marshall Adams and Paul Donachie seem to bask in the desert sun.) But mostly, I think how you feel about “Pluribus” comes down to how you feel about Carol, and your investment in the trajectory she takes from closeted, self-loathing romantasy author to airlifting an atom bomb onto Manousos’s doorstep.\n\nThe premise of “Pluribus” is abstract and allegorical by design, and Gilligan has said in interviews he prefers to leave interpretation to his audience. While the hive’s parallels to AI are uncanny — they even respond to prompts! — I’m partial to the most literal of readings. Millions of people don’t survive the process of assimilation into the hive, and Carol’s wife Helen (Miriam Shor) is one of the casualties. Carol is in mourning, and many of her most extreme, impulsive or just unsavory actions arise from that fact. So does our empathy for her.\n\nIn losing Helen, Carol has lost the one person on Earth who saw and accepted her for who she really was: her curmudgeonly qualities, but also the basic fact of her sexuality, which Carol hid from the public by making the romantic lead of her popular Wycaro series a man. Part of what makes the hive mind so eerie is how it’s able to provide a hollow facsimile of such intimacy. The hive absorbed Helen’s memories before she died, and deploys this knowledge in alternately earnest and manipulative ways. (Much of “Pluribus” operates from a place of ambiguity about The Joining and its consequences. That Human Derived Protein? It’s a last resort because the hive can’t kill what’s currently alive, so must make use of the dead for nutrition — no matter the species). Zosia (Karolina Wydra), the individual the hive deploys as its emissary to Carol, is chosen because she looks exactly like the romantic lead of Carol’s novels, before the character was genderbent into a man to reach a broader audience.\n\nThough “Pluribus” is a science fiction show, it eschews the mystery box structure deployed by so many of its genre peers. Questions remain about the hive, its motives and its mechanics, but they’re secondary to how Carol feels about the Joining and how she responds to it. For every new detail we learn about the hive, there’s a Carol-focused revelation like her painful history with anti-gay conversion therapy, which tells us all we need to know about her near-allergic reaction to the prospect of being forcibly assimilated into a dominant majority group. The hive’s unconscious natural instinct is to absorb whoever it can, and when Carol notes this fact on her whiteboard, she puts it in understandably personal terms: “Wants to CHANGE ME” — the last two words underlined. Carol’s precious safe harbor has been inverted into her worst fear, an abstract anxiety “Pluribus” renders concrete as only great horror, and horror-adjacent character studies, can.\n\nIn the last couple episodes of “Pluribus,” Carol’s resolve is tested, as any hero’s must be. She experiments with using the hive, as Diabaté has, to manifest her deepest desires. Carol sleeps with Zosia, asks her to use “I” pronouns instead of the hive’s preferred “we” and generally performs coupled domesticity. (Carol and Helen went to an ice hotel; Carol and Zosia go skiing.) This results in an amusing reversal wherein Manousos, who’s traveled thousands of miles in search of another skeptic, is just as appalled by Carol’s willing self-delusion as Carol once was by people like Laxmi (Menik Gooneratne), who refuses to acknowledge the obvious change in her own son. Carol is shocked out of her complacency only after learning that the hive has obtained her stem cells without her consent — from frozen eggs, so she could have a child with Helen — and could absorb her within the month.\n\nThe big shift in the “Pluribus” finale isn’t in our understanding of the hive, whose intentions were already shared. It’s within Carol, who chooses to ally herself with a fellow misanthrope in Manousos as unlikely saviors of mankind. I think there’s something beautiful in Gilligan employing such abundant resources, from tracking down and casting a Quechua speaker to shooting in the Canary Islands, in service of one person’s internal evolution. I also understand why it’s not for everyone — though, in my less generous moments, I’m frustrated that a story centered on a queer woman seems to get a shorter leash than Gilligan’s previous work about men doing crimes. To me, though, enjoying “Pluribus” isn’t about eating one’s cultural vegetables. It’s about enjoying a strange, absurd, uncategorizable show that’s also thoughtful and restrained. And it’s about Carol Sturka, a highly specific person whose unease with others is nonetheless broadly accessible. I’d never exchange her spiky, pushy personality for permanent affability, and I understand why she wouldn’t either.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 19:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T19:40:45.684327"}

He was 60.\n\nHis death was announced by his family and confirmed to Deadline by his manager Andrea Pett-Joseph, who called Finn “the kindest , most joyful person in any room” and said the actor passed while surrounded by family and friends.\n\nFinn was diagnosed in 2022 with bladder cancer, which went into remission but later returned and metastasized. In the months prior to the actor’s death, Finn’s friends launched a GoFundMe page on behalf of the family to help defray medical costs. To date the page has raised more than $118,000 in donations.\n\nBorn in Evanston, Illinois, on July 31, 1965, Finn joined Chicago’s Second City and iO comedy troupes after graduating from Marquette University (where he became friends with future Saturday Night Live star Chris Farley) in 1987. His TV breakthrough came in the mid-1990s, when he landed recurring roles on The George Wendt Show and Murphy Brown. In 1998 he played the party-throwing character Joe Mayo in the memorable “The Reverse Peephole” episode of Seinfeld.\n\nOther TV roles included appearances on That ’70s Show, The King of Queens, two episodes of Friends (he played Dr. Roger), and several episodes of Third Rock From The Sun. He played the character Jim Frost on eight episodes in 2001 and 2002 of the comedy-drama Ed, and made episodic appearances on Yes, Dear, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Bernie Mac Show, Wizards of Waverly Place, 2 Broke Girls and The Goldbergs, among others.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018 Finn played nice-guy Bill Norwood on 23 episodes of The Middle, neighbor to the sitcom’s main characters the Hecks and good buddy of Neil Flynn’s Mike Heck. In 2012 and 2013, he played Bob Forman on 18 episodes of the Nickelodeon sitcom Marvin Marvin.\n\nOn the big screen, Finn appeared in the 2000 comedy Dude, Where’s My Car, I Love You, Beth Cooper, and It’s Complicated starring Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin.\n\nFinn is survived by wife Donna, and their children, Cassidy, Caitlin and Ryan, his parents and other family.\n\nIn a post on X, Finn’s friends and fellow comedians Brian Stack and Jeff Dye shared tributes. “One of the best dudes I knew with a PERFECT sense of humor,” wrote Dye.\n\nHeartbroken that our dear friend, Pat Finn, passed away. As kind as he was brilliantly hilarious. This video of him at our Chicago apartment in ‘96, making his baby daughter Cassidy pretend to drive a bus and do karate kicks is priceless.

However, as the film progresses, [&#8230;]", "content": "Foreboding title aside, one could reasonably begin watching Charlie Polinger’s “The Plague” and assume that it is a Y.A. coming of age drama— a modern-day “The 400 Blows” or a male “Welcome to the Dollhouse” about a group of teenaged boys spending their summer at a sleepaway water polo camp. However, as the film progresses, not only does its narrative get increasingly sinister, but the look and feel of the film subtly lull the audience away from a vivacious security and into the darkest psychological realms of early adolescence.\n\nBecause of the movie’s water polo camp setting, much of it takes place in and around an indoor pool. Anyone who has been to a YMCA in the early morning knows the harsh fluorescence of these environments. Accordingly, the film’s first two acts are brightly lit, appearing almost sterilized at times.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn the opening shot, the camera is fully submerged in the pool, introducing the first of many underwater shots as the boys jump into the water, their legs kicking around and disrupting the aquatic stillness. While the swimming pool’s chlorine-washed blue is unmistakable, cinematographer Steven Breckon says that he and Polinger were trying to avoid cliched underwater shots. “The classic underwater shot is a perfume commercial with a woman in flowy drapery clothing and there’s like a God light beam on it,” Breckon tells Variety. “That’s nowhere close to what we wanted this material to look like and we were actually kind of inspired by more of a deep focus, like a painting.”\n\nTo achieve the underwater shots, Breckon explains that the camera operator was beneath the surface, receiving instructions through speakers. “I could basically talk to him through a giant megaphone speaker that is placed underwater, so it was like garbled instructions and he would just nod the camera ‘yes’ or nod the camera ‘no’ to confirm that he heard me.”\n\nEven as the camera becomes less static, circling around the kids treading water, bobbing up and down with seeming serendipity, Breckon says that it was more carefully orchestrated than it appears. He says that the camera was “on a flotation rig that you can deflate to the perfect level where it’s sort of half in and half out. And by pushing it on the surface through those boys and having all the splashing going on, it has a very chaotic energy,” however, “it was very diagrammed out. There really wasn’t a lot of finding it in the moment because we just had to be so safe with the boys. You know, we had lifeguards on every corner of the frame.”\n\nThe sequence’s handheld look is complemented by its sound and score, which synchronously cuts in and out every time the camera submerges and resurfaces. “I’m pretty sure that the actual ducking of the sound of the music was done by Damien (Volpe) and Dave (Paterson) in the sound department. But I was there. I went for those sessions,” composer Johan Lenox tells Variety.\n\nWhile the cinematography slowly morphs from the deceptive brightness of a bildungsroman to a darkness of a horror movie over the course of the runtime, the music is consistently eerie from the beginning, cluing audiences that not all is well for this group of kids. “The music is scary, but it’s also like, insanely weird,” says Lenox. “We wanted to telegraph early that some goofy and insane shit is gonna happen.”\n\nThe foreboding energy is accented by music’s surreal, sometimes liminal qualities. “You’re just hearing me wailing into this microphone,” Lenox continues, noting that while the music is strange throughout, there are subtle escalations as the movie progresses. “I don’t think there’s a string instrument in the first third or half of the movie. And then these gritty, noisy sounds from string instruments start to creep in on top of the vocals and eventually supplant them just as the fun sort of stops,” explains Lenox. “Then also there are these tense swelling drone sounds pushing into these hallways and stuff like that. I think there’s a shorter one early in the movie and then there’s like a fucking three or four minute long one by the end.”\n\n“The Plague”’s sight and sound does have conspicuous breaks from its sinister mold. Notably, when the kids sneak out at night partway through the film, a handheld long take captures them partying in an alley.\n\n“That’s probably the scene that’s the most extreme version of what I describe as ‘the sandbox,’” says Breckon. “There’re these broad strokes that were very set up and diagrammed out, but then within that, it’s just chaos, letting them go every which way. In terms of actually approaching it, I was trying my best to get us to commit to a 180 degree plus area, thinking we’ll flip around and get the other side, but the kids were going in circles and doing everything, so it very quickly became a 360 area and that posed some challenges. As a cinematographer, you want everybody to be in the back light, and you don’t want moments of too much front light. So I was trying to keep up with that scene as it was unfolding in front of us, but there was no version of me being like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. This isn’t the way that I want it to look.’ Instead, it was like, ‘No, the kids are telling us what it needs to be.’”\n\nThe scene reaches a crescendo when one of the boys pops a CD into a boom box and an Italian pop song plays. While the song could easily be mistaken for an obscure, but fitting needle drop, it is still an original piece composed by Lenox for the film. “Let’s fucking write our own thing. Like, why not?” reflects Lenox, appreciating how that the film’s “sonic world is 90% of one thing and then this other thing that comes in. It’s intentional. It could not be more opposite to everything else. I really like it as a structure and shape.”\n\nThe song is titled “Corsa Notturna” and it features Italian vocals from a child. It is some of the only vocals in the soundtrack that do not belong to Lenox himself. The song returns once more at the end of the film, in a dance sequence that once again showcases innovative camera techniques.\n\nAs the main character dances freely, we spin with him until a unique effect takes hold and it seems as if the rotation is continuing while seamlessly cutting between the boy and his revolving prospective. Breckon, however, explains that the shot was not cut at all. The team created a rotating six-sided mirror that the actor was stationary inside of, allowing him to intermittently appear in the reverse shot while maintaining the outward-facing circular motion.\n\n“As he becomes part of the image, and it goes from the people looking at him to just him, he’s actually slowing down. He’s not himself spinning anymore, and he’s starting to take stock of the situation in the moment, but its contrasted by the fact that this mirror is spinning faster and faster,” says Breckon. It is a transfixing effect that closes the film, effectively encapsulating the story’s dizzying approach to self-acceptance.\n\nThe influences for “The Plague” are manifold. Between Breckon and Lenox, they mention taking inspiration from “Raw,” “Carrie” and “The Shining,” but also “Full Metal Jacket,” “8 ½” “The Dark Knight” and “Superbad” to shape the look and sound. The result is something wholly unique: a coming-of-age horror movie that explores the social, psychological and physical viscerality of growing up.\n\n“The Plague” debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May. IFC acquired its distribution rights in August and will release the film in theaters on Dec. 24.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T21:24:12.820965"}

He had wrapped his final directing gig — the 2013 “Mob City” episode “Red Light”— and moved with his wife to California’s Central Coast, where he could bask in the wake of an incredible filmography that included “The Shawshank Redemption,” “The Green Mile,” “The Mist,” episodes of “The Walking Dead,” “The Shield,” “Tales from the Crypt” and more.\n\nAbout a decade into retirement, however, Darabont received a call from his agent, informing him that Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of “Stranger Things,” were fans of his work. The feeling was mutual, as Darabont and his wife had binged the Netflix series’ first four seasons several times over. The agents set up a friendly meeting between them when the Duffers were still developing the show’s fifth and final season.\n\nShortly thereafter, Dan Trachtenberg, who was attached to direct two episodes of “Stranger Things 5,” dropped out due to a scheduling conflict with his next film, “Predator: Badlands.” In a Hail Mary, the Duffers offered Darabont to take Trachtenberg’s place, and after a week’s consideration, he decided to come out of retirement to join the “Stranger Things” team on set.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWinona Ryder as Joyce Byers and Noah Schnapp as Will Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDarabont, 66, directed Episodes 3 and 5 of the final season. Episode 3 released in with Volume 1 on Nov. 26. Titled “The Turnbow Trap,” the episode is packed with action and emotion in the Upside Down and the Rightside Up, showcasing a triumphant return for the director. Episode 5, titled “Shock Jock,” will kick off the three-episode second volume on Dec. 25. (The “Stranger Things” series finale releases in theaters and on Netflix Dec. 31.)\n\nBetween the volumes, Variety spoke with the director to hear about his experience working on “Stranger Things” and his return to the filmmaking craft after twelve years since he last sat in the director’s chair.\n\nWe heard that you were a fan of “Stranger Things” before you met the Duffer brothers. How did you get into the show?\n\nMy wife and I were fans of the show from early on. We actually had watched all four seasons three or four or maybe even five times. It was so good. Then one day out of the blue, my agent called me and said, “The agent in the office next to me represents the Duffer brothers, and he just wanted me to tell you that they’re big fans of yours.” I said, “That’s fantastic. That’s very flattering. I’m big fans of theirs.” So I thought, “Well, next time I’m in L.A., I’ll get together with them for lunch and just compliment them.” I also was fascinated to know where the heck they came from, because I never heard of the Duffer brothers before they created this huge success on Netflix. So I had lunch with them when I was down in L.A. and I think about a week later, my agent called me again and said they’re inviting you to come direct an episode.\n\nAnd what was your initial reaction to that?\n\nI hadn’t done it in a while, but they said it’s like riding a bicycle: You don’t forget. And they were right. From the first moment on set, there was nothing unfamiliar about the process for me, though it had been about 13 years. The one episode offer wound up being two episodes and six months in Atlanta. It was a hell of a great experience.\n\nThe Duffer brothers told us that you took about a week to consider the offer. What was going through your mind during that week and what made you want to accept?\n\nWell, once you’re retired, it’s bliss. My wife and I live on the Central Coast in Monterey, where we don’t have the pressures of Hollywood on our back. I’m enjoying life, and for once I’m no longer the workaholic that I was for almost 30 years in Hollywood. So I had to wrestle with that question and, of course, talk to my wife about it, because I wasn’t going to go to Atlanta unless she came also. I love being married, and I’m not going to be in some place for months without her. We also have five chihuahuas that we would have to take. It was kind of a big move, especially once it became two episodes. We were looking at six months living in a different place. When you’re young and single, it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re an old fart like me who has sunk roots in a community and is comfortable being an unemployed bum, you have to ask yourself “Do I really do this?” But ultimately, it was my love for the show and my wife’s love for the show that kind of overruled all those other concerns and we said, “What the heck? Let’s do it!” I’m glad we did.\n\nNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhile you were considering, were you allowed to read the scripts for the episodes that you would direct?\n\nYeah, they had sent me the scripts and I thought they were terrific. I asked for all of the scripts that they had written thus far so I could track what was going on in the whole thing. They were very generous with sending me those, as long as it was kept under strict secrecy. They’re not quite the nuclear codes, but they’re pretty close. The fascinating thing about our culture is how much people want to dig into this stuff instead of wait to be surprised by what they see on screen. I am the ultimate no-spoilers guy. When I was in junior high, I went to go see “Soylent Green” and some asshole fellow students told me before I went in, “Oh, Soylent Green is people.” I’ve never forgiven them. It’s part of the reason why I’m not on social media and I’m also reluctant to watch trailers. Too much is given away. If I have an interest in something, I want to enjoy it fresh.\n\nDid you notice anything different in the process of filmmaking returning to the director’s chair after 12 or 13 years?\n\nOh gosh, yeah. Only on “Mob City” did I finally transition from film to digital, and I ended up loving it. It helps a director so much because you don’t ever have to call a cut. Whenever a director calls cut, the energy on a set dissipates. Now you can just say, “Everybody back to one” and the energy remains where it needs to be. The actors remain in the same headspace as you roll three or four takes before calling cut. I love that aspect of it. Filmmakers have so many new tools now. [On “Stranger Things”] our DP was shooting with a techno crane, which can sometimes be frustrating, but can do brilliant things. Also the camera operator is no longer where you’d think he is. He’s not by the camera anymore, but often in some tent off to the side. Same with whoever’s pulling focus. They’re longer next to the camera all the time. So much has been outsourced to these technological devices.\n\n\n\nBut I have to praise this crew. They were absolutely wonderful across the board. A director’s relationship with their crew is very important to me, especially the DP and AD, and I had great on both. Brett Jutkiewicz was my DP and Lisa Rowe was my AD, and they were both fantastic. The Duffers know how to crew up a show, and some of these folks had been with them since Season 1. There were so many resources all around me that could help answer any question. It was a great, collaborative vibe.\n\nEpisode 3 has lots of emotional scenes, including heavy dialogues between Will (Noah Schnapp) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), Will and Robin (Maya Hawke) and Holly (Nell Fisher) and Henry (Jamie Campbell Bower). What was it like working with this ensemble to create those dramatic dynamics?\n\nI’ve always said that if you have the right actor, there’s not much that they need to hear from a director. I learned that on my very first theatrical feature, “The Shawshank Redemption.” Sometimes a director can get too much into an actor’s ear. Tim Robbins, for example, loves conversations with the director. Morgan Freeman does not. He’s a very intuitive, very instinctive actor, and does a brilliant work. Both of them do. I remember midway through the shoot, I was talking to Morgan about whatever scene we’re going to shoot next and I could see his eyes glazing over. He was just being very polite and listening to me, so I stopped myself and said, “Morgan, you really don’t need to hear this, do you?” and he goes “No, just tell me where to stand and how to turn. That kind of stuff.” From that moment on, I let him do his job. It was a great lesson for a first-time director. Every actor is different.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nDid the cast of “Stranger Things” prefer more dialogue and direction, or did most of them take control of their own performances? Or was there a mix?\n\nThey’d been doing it for so long, especially the youngsters who were around 10 when they started and now they’re young adults. They’ve been with these characters for half of their lives, so they’re pretty dialed in. There were little, physical things that needed direction, like when Dustin [Gaten Matarazzo] comes out of the van and drops this big bag of tools right in front of the lens. To have it fall exactly where the camera is going to land took a lot of practice and blocking. I think there were five takes or something. There were also things like Caleb [McLaughlin] running down the stairs after he’s thrown acetone at the Demogorgon. I needed him to pause and look back at a certain moment because I knew something was going to be added in post that needed an extra beat of time. You’re sort of doing all this calculus on set to make sure it can be cut together right. That’s usually where I get more specific and precise with an actor, but aside from that, they know their characters. As a director, my job is to provide the raw materials for what you need in the editing room and also to be head cheerleader on set. You’re cheering everybody on and encouraging them. A small bit of encouragement or recognition from the director can fuel you for another 24 hours of exhausting work\n\nHas this experience made you want to direct more, or are you comfortable returning to retirement?\n\nI really do love being retired. However, I also love being on a set with creative people, as long as I’m not fighting battles with some evil empire, studio, or network. I bless Netflix for being so supportive. If you have a good situation like that and it can be about the creative process, then its a pleasure. So my longwinded answer winds up being, it depends. If there’s a friendly situation and I’m excited enough about the material, then it’s certainly a possibility. I’m not ruling anything out, but it would have to be something special. “Stranger Things” was a special opportunity for me to be a small part of a very large, wonderful thing that so many people love. I’m grateful to the Duffers for that opportunity. It will always be a great memory working with them and that cast and crew. I will love seeing where their careers take them. They all have such potential and they’re such good people.\n\nI know you don’t like spoilers, but what can we look forward to in Episode 5?\n\nI think in Episode 5 you’re gonna get some really cool stuff with Henry. I don’t think I’m really spoiling anything by saying that you can you see in Episode 3 that we’re kind of heading into his story more. It was a great thrill to do. We have a lot of good acting and good scenes that you can look forward to.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T21:42:28.770979"}

What’s especially hard for me with PJ’s passing is that he lived with that kind of violence. What I was spared, he endured in a different form, at an age where there is no emotional defense, and the self is still forming.

But society friends Dinah (Leslie Bibb) and Evelyn (Allison Janney) — along with Ann (Mindy Cohn), as Palm Beach’s resident reporter — quickly discovered at the morgue that the deceased is not Maxine.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMeanwhile, Perry (Jordan Bridges) delivered “Maxine’s” ashes to a devastated Douglas (Josh Lucas), as the town gathered for the funeral, completely unaware that the very much alive Maxine is hiding inside the casket. The eccentric spiritualist Mary delivered a message from the real dead woman — Maxine’s twin, Mirabelle — then lifted the casket lid and saw that Maxine was there. Chaos erupted: mourners gasp, Mitzi (Kaia Gerber) ran screaming, and an inconsolable Douglas eulogized his ex, telling the “dead” Maxine how much he loves her.\n\nLater that night, Maxine and Douglas connected, and she asked if he truly meant what he said at the church, that he loves her… but his answer isn’t exactly what she expected.\n\n“He’s untethered, he’s lost, and he’s terrified,” Josh Lucas tells Variety. “He’s in such pain. He’s just devastated… And then you think, is it because he loves her so much or is it because he’s totally a narcissist?”\n\nDouglas (Josh Lucas) and Mitzi (Kaia Geber) attend Maxine’s funeral on ‘Palm Royale.’ Erica Parise\n\nMaxine and Douglas’ love affair has changed since moving to Palm Royale. “When you have a relationship that’s that long — and even though you can dismiss it as these two are silly people — their souls are exploded,” he says. “So I don’t think Douglas is thinking about putting the pieces back together. I think he’s now truly unleashed. … His world has been his oyster, and it no longer is.”\n\nIt began with his infidelity and “each piece of it, it just keeps getting worse,” Lucas adds. “He loses Maxine, causes her to have a heart attack, and then when he finally [completely] loses her, I think he’s not a man who’s ever gonna put it back together again. He is not going to therapy.”\n\nLucas believes that up to the point he met Maxine, women were truly just “transactional” for him —and marrying Linda/Penelope (Laura Dern) was just “the next right thing to do for his life, career and money.”\n\nHe continues, “I think when he met Maxine, he truly fell in love. My sense of him is that he actually did have integrity in it, particularly in his mind that he was loyal and faithful, and he took great pride in that because he was flying all over the world. And sure, he would flirt with stewardesses, but he wouldn’t do anything.”\n\nThere is something childlike about Douglas — or dog-like, as Lucas says.\n\n“He’s a Labrador puppy, who just is having the best time destroying the house, but then realizes, ‘Oh, my God, I destroyed the house!’” he says with a grin. “Look, he comes from incredible privilege. One of the things I think is so terrific about this show is the candy-coated confection of it all — but in the center of it is kind of this bitter pill all the time of reality.”\n\nThat dichotomy was part of the character design from the beginning. “Abe Sylvia and the creators, I don’t want to say in any way are making fun of these people because they’re not. These people exist, particularly back in this time,” he says of the 1970s setting. “But there’s obviously a through line to these, particularly white men of incredible wealth and privilege who just have no real understanding of the world. They’re truly in their own bubble. And Douglas has been in it his entire life.”\n\nIn a way, Maxine and Douglas’ marriage is playing out in a very realistic 1970s scenario, when men had their roles in the family and career, and women had theirs. Pre-Palm Royale, Maxine was a traditional wife, and Douglas was just fine with that.\n\n“She talks about it — she’s a trad wife, and she takes great pride in that,” he says. “There’s honor in it. I do think that’s a very interesting thing that’s even going on in today’s time — the value or devalue of that. That’s where the show finds all these lovely through lines — Roe v Wade, women’s rights and the civil rights movement. But Douglas and Maxine are completely devoid of that.”\n\nDuring a recent Q&A, Sylvia reminded the audience that during this period of time, in certain parts of this country, a woman could not have a checking account without her husband’s signature.\n\n“Those would be things that Douglas would think would be good. And Maxine, her eyes are obviously being opened throughout the show by all these women who are showing her these layers of what’s possible in how society’s changing,” Lucas points out. “But I also think she takes great pride in being a wife who really loves and takes care of her husband. … I think we really try and stay away from pounding any sort of obvious political or psycho sociological message and just purely allow the show to exist as a confection.”\n\n“Palm Royale” Season 2 is currently streaming exclusively on Apple TV+, with new episodes arriving weekly on Wednesdays.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:13:17 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T05:34:16.347630"}

If you can’t get enough Italian gangster prequels, are dying to know where Lupin protagonist Assane Diop’s story goes next or need your fix of Disney+ bonkbuster, then you’ve come to the right place, as we walk you through 2026 in TV terms.\n\nGomorrah (Sky)\n\nSky\n\nNow here’s a prequel the world can get on board with – or on the peddle bike if we’re using the above image as a reference. Already envisaged as running for at least three seasons, Gomorrah – The Origins takes audiences back to 1977 Naples, tracking the criminal coming-of-age of the young Pietro Savastano, a “tough city kid who grew up in the poorest parts of Secondigliano.” Produced by Sky Studios and Cattleya, the show will expand the world of one of Sky’s most popular foreign dramas, inspired by Roberto Saviano’s bestselling non-fiction novel. Across five seasons and more than 50 episodes, Gomorrah was a huge hit for the pay-TV giant, putting it on the map in Italy. Sky may not make an enormous amount of original content from the nation anymore, but if The Origins can attract the kind of ratings and awards buzz of its predecessor, that will go a long way to keeping its name relevant in the original content game. The prequel stars Luca Lubrano, Francesco Pellegrino and Flavio Furno.\n\nLupin (Netflix)\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n‘Lupin’ Netflix\n\nWhen it lands in fall 2026, it will be three years since the previous instalment of Netflix’s slick French-language drama about master thief Assane Diop, played by the charismatic Omar Sy. That’s a long time to wait – and will no doubt raise the regular debate around wait times between seasons of streaming shows – but it’ll also mean anticipation reaches a crescendo and it’s bound to win over any frustrated fans. Based on the Arsène Lupin character Maurice Leblanc created in the early 1900s, the series initially followed Assane’s revenge mission against the Pellegrini family who wronged his father, before morphing into a search for his abducted son and then on to his mission to steal the Black Pearl. Viewers will know Part 3 ended with Assane finally in jail, but given his skills picking locks and disappearing from tight spaces, we can confidently say he won’t remain there for long. Ludivine Sagnier, Antoine Gouy and Soufiane Guerrab are among those returning, with the creative team of George Kay and François Uzan back, and Louis Leterrier and Sy himself the showrunners.\n\nRivals (Disney+)\n\nDisney\n\nThe buzz is building for the second season of Disney+’s Rivals to the point where the actual Queen consort of the UK visited the set earlier this month. Queen Camilla was on set to pay tribute to the late Jilly Cooper, the Rivals author who passed away earlier this year, and the cast and creative team behind the bonkbuster have been doing the same as they ready a second run of the adaptation starring David Tennant, Nafessa Williams and Aidan Turner. Following a dramatic cliffhanger ending to Season 1, audiences can expect more drama, swagger and jaw-dropping romps in the second run as Rupert Everett and Hayley Atwell join the cast and the show continues to delve deep into the cutthroat world of 1980s British TV franchise bidding (it’s way more fun than it sounds, promise). This quintessentially British period drama may have seemed a bit leftfield when Disney+ first jumped aboard, but it is now firmly established as one of the streamer’s most prominent international originals.\n\nBerlin and the Lady with an Ermine (Netflix)\n\nFelipe Hernández/Netflix\n\nThe secret sauce behind the success of Álex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato’s hit Money Heist franchise has been the ability to reinvent while retaining DNA. With that in mind, enter Berlin and the Lady with an Ermine, the second season of Money Heist spin-off Berlin that brings a name change and some new characters, but the same sense of fun that has cemented the franchise as one of the most successful non-English-language shows of all time. This time around, Berlin and Damián are bringing the gang together to pretend to steal Da Vinci’s ‘Lady with an Ermine’ portrait. But their real target is the Duke of Málaga and his wife, a couple who think they can blackmail Berlin. With his mix of deadly dark humor and a clearly tortured past, Pedro Alonso’s Berlin was always ripe for a spin-off, which has manifested in the show’s success on Netflix. The Lady with an Ermine will likely prove that Pina and Lobato continue to be one of the deadliest duos in the biz today.\n\nThe Night Manager (BBC, Prime Video)\n\nThe Ink Factory/BBC/Amazon/Des Willie\n\nTom Hiddleston’s Jonathan Pine is back after a decade. Now living as Alex Goodwin – a low-level MI6 officer running a quiet surveillance unit in London – his life is comfortingly uneventful. It won’t surprise audiences to find out that this won’t be the case for long. Starring Hiddleston, Olivia Colman, Elizabeth Debicki and Hugh Laurie, The Night Manager was one of 2016’s most popular dramas and it has been welcomed back into the fold, with a deluxe double-season order and a new co-pro partner in Prime Video. This season, which kicks off on New Year’s Day on the BBC and mid-Jan on PV, welcomes Daisy Jones & The Six star Camila Morrone, but what of Laurie’s Richard Roper? Last seen bundled into the back of a van, all eyes will be on Roper’s potential return. John le Carré adaptations have proven to be a rich well for the BBC to mine – it is also adapting The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and A Legacy of Spies starring Matthew Macfadyen with MGM+ – and this one could be a banker.\n\nHow To Get to Heaven From Belfast (Netflix)\n\nChristopher Barr/Netflix\n\nEver since Derry Girls wrapped in 2022, all eyes have been trained on where next for the stupendous comic talent of Lisa McGee. McGee’s next project may also have a Northern Irish city in the title, but the vibe has shifted, as has the commissioner, following a sign-of-the-times moment that saw Netflix swoop in and pick up the show from Channel 4 when the latter simply couldn’t afford it. How to Get to Heaven From Belfast is described by McGee as a “mash up of two different genres, mystery and comedy,” following Saoirse, Robyn and Dara as they head out on a weird and wild adventure “full of twists, turns, and arguments about eyelash extensions.” Expect some trademark McGee wit with perhaps a bit more bite and a few more weighty plot points than Derry Girls. Viewers are in for a treat.\n\n4 Blocks Zero (HBO Max)\n\n4 Blocks Zero will one of the big draws for HBO Max as it rolls out in more major European territories next year, especially in Germany, the country from where the prequel to the critically-acclaimed 4 Blocks hails. While the original series, made for Warner-owned German network TNT Serie between 2017-2019, focused on how Ali ‘Toni’ Hamadi, the leader of a Berlin-Neukölln crime family, attempted to leave the gangster’s life behind, the prequel details how the Hamadi family became the most influential Arabic underworld clan in the city. Quirin Berg and Max Wiedemann are back to exec produce, with Bernd Lange leading a writing team. No detail yet on the cast, but this is certain to be one of 2026’s biggest European drama launches. The original 4 Blocks won major domestic prizes such as the Grimme-Preis for lead actor Kida Khodr Ramadan Ramadan, co-star Veysel Gelin, and director Marvin Kren, along with six German Television Awards, including Best Drama Series. 4 Blocks Zero will have similarly lofty ambitions.\n\nEl Homenaje (SkyShowtime)\n\nThis crime family thriller, whose English-language title is The Tribute, feels like it could be described as SkyShowtime’s answer to Succession. Shot in Spain, it tells the story of Adolfo Novak (Eusebio Poncela), patriarch of one of the most powerful families in the country, who gathers his family and close friends to celebrate his 80th birthday. As the evening unfolds, a dark truth gets revealed that has the potential to destroy everything. It quietly filmed last year, with the cast and production team primarily hailing from SkyShowtime’s well-received drama series Matices (Shades). Along with Poncela, who plays the steely lead, Miriam Giovanelli, Juana Acosta, Enrique Arce, Raúl Prieto, Luis Tosar, Luisa Mayol and Elsa Pataky all return in new roles, having appeared in Matices. Secuoya Studios, which has been attaching itself to several eye-catching Spanish-language dramas, is producing alongside Stellarmedia. Prime Video is attached for second window rights – another sign that the Spanish-language project has been well received in Spain and could be set for further travel.\n\nVaka (Prime Video)\n\nDeadline first told you about this dystopian thriller out of Sweden back in March. Aliette Opheim and Jonas Karlsson star in Vaka, which follows the spread of a deadly insomnia epidemic in Stockholm through the eyes of people in very different circumstances – for example, a disgraced minister has to balance addressing the crisis and caring for his son, while an ambulance nurse goes to great lengths to save her lover and a teenage girl protects a neighbor’s son after his family succumbs. Their stories slowly intertwine and the living nightmare fuels growing panic. Skybound Entertainment, no stranger to end-of-times narratives thanks to its work on The Walking Dead, controls the rights and struck a deal with Prime Video Nordics to local rights, while shopping it elsewhere. Amazon MGM Studios, Unlimited Stories and Sagafilm, the latter of which was acquired by Skybound and 5th Planet Games last year, are also attached, with Nordic soft money also involved. In a post-pandemic world where a collective trauma has been felt worldwide, the six-part series will have a greater significance for many viewers. Prime Video now also has rights in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands, and will launch the show on January 30, 2026.\n\nHarvest (New8)\n\nDR Sales\n\nOscar-nominated writer-director Martin Zandvliet’s latest TV series is rather fantastically billed by its distributor, DR Sales, as “Succession with tractors and tradition.” The eight-episode show stars the likes of Katrine Greis-Rosenthal, Elliott Crosset Hove, Lars Brygmann, Charlotte Fich, Simon Bennebjerg and Joachim Fjelstrup in a drama set in rural Denmark, where in-fighting breaks out over the future of a family farm. When the patriarch names his youngest daughter as his successor, the family is torn apart as her brother, a resentful nephew and others vie for control. The family are further forced into the spotlight by a shocking scare involving two missing children. European commissioning club New8 is behind the show, which Danish pubcaster DR had initially ordered in 2024. International delivery is expected in Q4 2026, with a festival release expected before that, around the second quarter of next year. Maybe this is one for Canneseries? Fans of Zandvliet’s Academy Award-nominated Land of Mine will be ploughing the fields in anticipation for this one.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T11:23:05.919751"}

The PG-13 adventure is expected to secure around $20 million between Thursday and Sunday. A $45 million-budgeted meta-reboot, “Anaconda” follows best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie (you guessed it!) 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down.\n\n“Marty Supreme” was ever-so-slightly behind “Anaconda” on box office charts with $2.01 million from 2,668 venues during Wednesday’s previews.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was canceled by its host this year in protest of the addition of Donald Trump‘s name to the Washington, D.C., building.\n\nChuck Redd, a jazz drummer and vibraphonist who has hosted the annual holiday “Jazz Jams“ at the Kennedy Center since 2006 (he took over for previous host Keter Betts, a jazz bassist who died in 2005), told the Associated Press last night that he decided to drop this year’s event after Trump’s name was added to the venue by its Trump-appointed board.\n\n“When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd told The Associated Press. The concert would have included performances from seven jazz musicians.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe addition of Trump’s name to the venue appears to be in violation of a 1964 law that prohibits the addition of names or memorials to anyone other than John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in 1963. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH) filed a lawsuit on Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeking a declaration that the name of the arts institution is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and that a board vote last week to change the name is null and void.\n\n“Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center’s name requires an act of Congress,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “But on December 18 and 19, 2025—in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic—the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order. Congress intended the Center to be a living memorial to President Kennedy—and a crown jewel of the arts for all Americans, irrespective of party. Unless and until this Court intervenes, Defendants will continue to defy Congress and thwart the law for improper ends.”\n\nAfter Trump’s name was added to the venue, Roma Daravi, spokeswoman for the center, defended the board’s authority to change the name. “This action is in line with the precedent of the State Department adding President Trump’s name to the Institute of Peace. And the previous Administration renaming military bases.” she said in a statement. (The renaming of the military bases that had Confederate names was authorized by an act of Congress in 2021.)\n\nThe jazz concert is just the latest casualty of Trump’s takeover of the venerable arts institution. Earlier this week, the American College Theatre Festival suspended its 60-year partnership with the Kennedy Center, with Festival officials saying the affiliation is “no longer viable” due to “circumstances and decisions that do not align with our organization’s values.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center has not yet commented on the jazz concert cancellation, with its official website merely confirming that the concert was canceled. The website also indicates that admission to the concert was free of charge.\n\nAmong the artists who have canceled Kennedy Center appearances post-Trump takeover are Issa Rae, Peter Wolf and a planned production of Hamilton, among others.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 16:52:53 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T16:58:33.975186"}

Safdie and his crew faithfully recreated the world of 1950s ping pong players in New York, Tokyo and beyond, then populated that milieu with a cast of memorable supporting characters from movie star Kay Stone, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, to her ruthless businessman husband, played by Mr. Wonderful himself, Kevin O’Leary.\n\nThe details of the parlors and matches are so carefully rendered that it’s no surprise that Safdie is very familiar with that world. In fact, his 2008 film “The Pleasure of Being Robbed” features a sequence set in a Chinatown table tennis parlor.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“The people who excelled at table tennis were often people who didn’t fit anywhere else,” says Safdie in the film’s press materials. “It wasn’t respected, so naturally it attracted weirdos, purists, obsessives.”\n\nIn addition to doing extensive historical research, the crew consulted experts, including Steve Grant, publisher of Table Tennis History magazine, who spoke to Variety about the inspiration for the film.\n\nWas Marty Mauser based on a real person?\n\nMarty Mauser, played by Chalamet, is based on a real table tennis champion of the 1950s, Marty Reisman, who died in 2012. Sports Illustrated called him “the game’s most celebrated hustler.” While the film is only loosely inspired by his story, the character definitely shares similarities with Reisman, Grant explains.\n\n“He was very good at marketing himself,” Grant says, “That was his biggest skill. Of course, he was a very good player.” But like Marty Mauser, who plays pretty loose with the truth, Reisman likely inflated his stories, Grant says. Reisman’s book, “The Money Player,” is a “great book about his career back in the ’50s,” Grant explains. “But don’t take everything in it as the word of truth. He liked to exaggerate things.”\n\nWhen Safdie came across an old copy of “The Money Player,” he sparked to the idea of a story based on Reisman. “When I read that the sport was filling stadiums in the U.K. and throughout Europe, I realized that it was entirely plausible for a kid in 1952 to actually believe he could parlay the game into a life of fame and glory,” Safdie said in the press materials.\n\nHow many of Marty Supreme’s stunts were real?\n\nWhile many of Marty Mauser’s antics stretch credulity, the real Reisman, nicknamed “the needle” for his slight build and fast swing, was known for his showmanship and hustle. He could split a cigarette in half with a ping pong ball from across the net and would play blindfolded or sitting down if the stakes were high enough. As shown in the film, he and a partner did tour the world with the Harlem Globetrotters with a comedy ping pong routine in which they hit balls with frying pans and sneakers.\n\nVariety’s announcement of “The Money Player” option\n\nThe real Reisman pulled off enough wild escapades to fill a whole other movie, according to an extensive Sports Illustrated profile — as he traveled the world, he was smuggling and selling goods, from nylon stockings to fine crystal, and challenging heads of state to high-stakes games. He really did fly on a military transport, as shown in the film, and did briefly work in a shoe store. Reisman told the magazine his book had sold to the movies, and he proposed that Robert De Niro could play him. But although it was optioned after publication, according to a 1974 Variety article, the project never got off the ground.\n\nDid Reisman really lose the World Championship to a Japanese player?\n\nReisman traveled to India, not Japan as in the movie, to compete against Hiroji Satoh. As depicted in the film, he took a hard loss to Satoh, who was using a new sponge rubber-coated type of paddle. But the loss came in round 64, not the final. “The truth was he would have had to win five more matches in 1952 to win the title, and he was not the top favorite,” Grant explains.\n\nWere there other Jewish table tennis champions?\n\n“Fellow Jewish New Yorker Dick Miles won many championships in the 1940s and ’50s, well before Reisman won much of anything,” Grant explains. In fact, Jewish Europeans, especially Hungarians, dominated table tennis in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1950s, Asian and particularly Japanese players began to gain prominence in the sport.\n\nWere any other characters based on real people?\n\nWhile many of the film’s characters feel deeply authentic, most are fictional, with the exception of Koto Endo, played by real-life champion Koto Kawaguchi and based on Reisman’s competitor Satoh. There’s also basketball star George “The Ice Man” Gervin, who plays a character based on Herwald Lawrence, who owned a ping pong parlor that was the first Black-owned business in Times Square.\n\nPlaywright David Mamet has a cameo in the film and he has a historic ping pong connection. Mamet, who was a table tennis hustler himself in his college days, used to frequent Reisman’s table tennis gym on the Upper West Side, along with other notables including Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 17:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T17:27:37.515320"}

I honestly have no idea what’s going on over there.\n\nI do know what’s going on over here though, and I can tell you that, from a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year. Tyranny is booming over here.\n\nYou may have read in your colourful newspapers my country’s President would like to shut me up because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored. The American government made a threat against me and the company I work for, and all of a sudden we were off the air. But then, you know what happened? A Christmas miracle happened. Well, it was September, it was a September miracle. But the holiday does seem to come earlier and earlier every year, doesn’t it?\n\nMillions and millions of people stood up and said: ‘No, this is not acceptable’. People who never watched my show, people who were on record saying they hate my show spoke out, they marched, they did this all to support the right to a free expression of speech and because so many people spoke out, we came back. Our show came back stronger than ever. We won, the President lost and now I’m back on the air every night givin’ the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking. That’s a word, right, I used it properly?\n\nAnd the reason I’m telling you this story is because maybe you’re thinking: ‘Oh a government silencing its critics is something that happens in places like Russia, or North Korea, or LA, not the UK’. Well, that’s what we thought and now we’ve got King Donny the Eighth calling for executions. It happens fast.\n\nYou know it’s funny we Americans are very proud of not having a king. It’s kind of why we left. Earlier this year tens of millions of us marched at protests called No Kings. You had some of those there. And just for the record we have nothing against your king. I mean I don’t know if you know this, but his son lives here. We just – well some of us – just have a problem with the guy who thinks he is our king.\n\nHere in the United States right now we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy. From the free press, to science, to medicine, to judicial independence, to the actual White House itself, we are a right mess. And we know this is also affecting you, and I just wanted to say sorry. And we want you to know or, at least I want you to know, that we’re not all like him. We’re not all like that.\n\nLook I know (from the musical Hamilton) that our countries didn’t start off on the greatest note, but I also know (from seeing Love Actually) that we have a special relationship. So, if I might speak on behalf of my country – which I most certainly do not – our message to you, our friends across the pond this Christmas is: don’t give up on us.

From now on, I’ll have to use the past tense, and that fills me with such profound sadness. But there’s no other choice.”\n\nThe Reiners, aged 78 and 70, were found dead in their Brentwood home on Dec. 14 with knife wounds. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder.\n\nScorsese first got to know Rob Reiner shortly after moving to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, when he started going to get-togethers hosted by George Memmoli and filled with comedians and actors.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Rob and I were both Eastern transplants, in a way,” Scorsese wrote. Reiner came from show business royalty, his parents being the performers Carl and Estelle Reiner. “This was 100 percent New York humor, and it was in the air I breathed.”\n\n“Right away, I loved hanging out with Rob. We had a natural affinity for each other. He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room,” Scorsese wrote. “He had a beautiful sense of uninhibited freedom, fully enjoying the life of the moment, and he had a great barreling laugh. When they honored him at Lincoln Center, Michael McKean did a bit, which was a brilliant parody of solemn official tribute speeches. Before he got to the punchline, Rob laughed so hard you could hear it throughout the auditorium.”\n\nScorsese’s favorite film directed by Reiner is “Misery,” which he described as “a very special film, beautifully acted by Kathy Bates and James Caan.” And he wrote that “This Is Spinal Tap” is “in a class of its own … an immaculate creation.” When Scorsese was casting his 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street,” he “immediately thought of Rob” to play the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort.\n\n“He could improvise with the best, he was a master at comedy, he worked beautifully with Leo and the rest of the guys, and he understood the human predicament of his character: The man loved his son, he was happy with his success, but he knew that he was destined for a fall,” Scorsese wrote of Reiner. “There’s that wonderful moment where Rob watches as Jon Favreau explains to Leo that he can get out relatively unscathed if he just walks away from his company before the S.E.C. has a chance to charge him with violations. The look on Rob’s face, as he realizes that Leo is hesitating and that he ultimately won’t stop, is so eloquent. ‘You got all the money in the world,’ he says. ‘You need everybody else’s money?’ A loving father, mystified by his son.”\n\nScorsese added, “I was moved by the delicacy and openness of his performance when we shot it, moved once again as we brought the scene together in the edit and moved as I watched the finished picture. Now, it breaks my heart to even think of the tenderness of Rob’s performance in this and other scenes.”\n\nThe filmmaker concluded his essay: “What happened to Rob and Michele is an obscenity, an abyss in lived reality. The only thing that will help me to accept it is the passing of time. So, like all of their loved ones and their friends — and these were people with many, many friends — I have to be allowed to imagine them alive and well … and that one day, I’ll be at a dinner or a party and find myself seated next to Rob, and I’ll hear his laugh and see his beatific face and laugh at his stories and relish his natural comic timing, and feel lucky all over again to have him as a friend.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 18:02:33 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T18:40:46.433418"}

It was one of those strange pitches where we’re going, ‘No, no, you guys can’t do this. You can’t.’ And they’re like, ‘We want to do this with you.’”\n\nPremiering on Christmas, this “Anaconda,” also directed by Gormican, is not a reboot, remake or even a continuation of the original. While the ’90s reptilian horror provides a solid springboard for the film, the new “Anaconda” is something different entirely, centering not on a National Geographic crew but rather a group of life-long, middle-aged friends who head to the Amazon to shoot their own version of the original film. Stars Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Steve Zahn and Thandiwe Newton soon find themselves fighting for survival against the world’s largest snake (which is even larger this time around, thanks to CGI). And while it definitely has nods to its predecessor, it was important to Gormican to toe the line carefully.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“These are two stories about taking a boat up the river, right?” said Gormican. “A snake basically slithers on land or in the water.

[But] I didn’t want to play in that sandbox.”\n\nInstead, they upped the comedic ante, creating what Gormican describes as a “buddy movie that becomes an adventure film that becomes an action film that becomes a horror film.” (He cites “City Slickers” and “American Movie” as points of inspiration). “Audiences are just tired of not seeing original stories,” he explained. “It’s been a decade of, ‘Here’s some remakes of stuff that you used to love,’ and there’s a limit to people’s nostalgia.”\n\nThis “Anaconda” is also full of meta elements that poke fun of Hollywood itself. Famously charismatic Rudd plays a struggling actor in Los Angeles, and the rag-tag group runs into a “real” Sony crew filming a reboot of “Anaconda” who joke about Hollywood having “no new ideas.” The characters also stumble upon original “Anaconda” star Ice Cube, who is on the studio’s snake-destroyed set to reprise his role. When they ask how the writers planned to kill the reptile in their movie, he responds they never finished the script.\n\n“It was mirroring exactly what was happening,” said Gormican, who lost two final locations while filming in Australia — the first being a factory that then went on strike, and the second being a boatyard the crew had created, only for it to get destroyed by a cyclone. Parts of the latter set actually made it into the movie as they pivoted to end the film using what was left of it: “We went in and made it look [purposefully] destroyed,” explained Gormican. “And we just said it was a snake.”\n\nAnd while “Anaconda” doesn’t get too sentimental over its source material, it does capitalize on a few familiar faces. In addition to Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez also has a cameo in the film, where the two actors play themselves. “We were always thinking that it would be fun to have the surviving members,” said Gormican, especially once they decided the friends would run into the filming of the reboot. “So we just kept reaching out.” Ultimately, both joined in, giving the film their “stamp of approval.” And, yes, they considered bringing back other “Anaconda” actors, though it ended up not making sense to: “If they died in the original, would they be back at the remake if their character was dead?”\n\nAbove all else, with this new “Anaconda,” Gormican was dedicated to creating a film that felt like fun.\n\n“The thing that I’ve been missing in my cinema-going experience is a movie for everyone, that plays in a massively fun, adventurous way,” said Gormican. “People lament the loss of the communal feeling of being at a comedy together. And I hope that people get a chance to experience that in this film, and maybe ignite something in a younger generation where they go, ‘Oh, shit. That’s actually something we love to do.’”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T23:44:48.207219"}

It can be difficult, first, to overcome the expectation that they’re either cash grabs or sops to sentimentality, and secondly, to come up with an original take on seasonal music, even with the best intentions. Should an artist deign to embark on a full-on Christmas music tour, suspicions might be even more aroused. What, other than opportunism, could be the reason for that much devotion to the season?\n\nSo God bless the occasional singer-songwriter like Ben Folds who sees Christmas as a way into writing the kinds of songs he would usually write, not just for the purposes of a new album but a proper concert outing. His recently wrapped Tis the Season tour was a veritable Christmas Star in shining a light on the right path to undertake doing this kind of thing, as was the album of mostly original material that precipitated it, 2024’s archly titled “Sleigher.” Folds brings to the concert state a satisfyingly holistic approach to holiday music, give or take a couple of “ho’s.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nEven before Folds recorded “Sleigher,” there was a body of solid evidence that he was the right man for the task. That was the fact that he’d already written and recorded a number of songs that mention Christmas or the holidays either prominently or incidentally — prior tunes that, combined with the “Sleigher” material, easily added up to a full set, before getting to any non-seasonal numbers thrown in as bonus tracks for the encore. Most notable of these, as any fan would know, is his late ’90s hit “Brick,” a ballad about taking one’s girlfriend to get an abortion on Dec. 26. Once you’ve written that as your first “Christmas song,” you’ve established a fine outer parameter for how far you’re willing to stretch the genre, such as it is.\n\nAt one of two sold-out appearances at L.A.’s new Blue Note Cafe, where he was among the few non-jazz artists booked thus far in the young life of that club, Folds and his combo naturally performed “Brick,” along with a few other pre-existing holiday songs that tended toward that outer edge, like the novelty songs “Bizarre Christmas Incident” and the indelicately titled “Bitch Went Nutz.” But being subversive about Christmas is not actually really his thing, or his current thing, anyway. And the “Sleigher” album, despite its irreverent name, tends more toward the center, with earnest songs that aren’t afraid to at least skim sentiment, if not indulge in it, even if the sentiment is loneliness. In the overall course of the set, Folds was able to play Christmas for comedy, but more often than not came up for something more earnest, all the way to covering Mel Torme and Vince Guaraldi without apology.\n\nRight at the outset, he explained why he came to see the season as a meaningful setting for original songs.\n\n“I like a good rhyme, and that’s why I guess I’ve bothered to write a whole Christmas album, plus a few other songs in my past,” he told the Blue Note audience. “There were Christmas songs and a whole slew of songs that mention it” in his catalog, “and I think the reason is because it is so all-pervasive once a year. It is such a bully of a holiday — it takes over everything. It’s the holiday that’s too big to fail. And it’s the same shit every year. It’s the same colors, the same sights, sounds, songs, everything… same ads… And that’s the gift.”\n\nHe would have to further explain that, and did.\n\n“Because when everything is the same and it just feels like a continuation of yesterday, which was 2024, and the day before that was Christmas 2023, the only thing that’s changed is you. And I think that’s the reason I’ve been interested in the topic. You could be at at dinner at Christmas and realize that only two days in Christmas time ago, there were a couple people that used to be here that are not here anymore. And then you’re sitting and talking to nephews who weren’t even here what seems like a couple days ago, and now they’re bald and telling you about their bankruptcy. It’s crazy. So, by having that as a marker, it makes it a rhyme. That’s what a rhyme is for. It is at the end of a phrase or a couplet to sound the same. Everything seems like it ought to be same, but it’s a little bit different; you actually learned something in the last 10 syllables.”\n\nBen Folds at the Blue Note Major Caldwell IV\n\nWith that, he went into “Christmas Time Rhyme,” which, as he explained, was originally supposed to be the title track of his holiday album last year, before “I thought of ‘Sleigher’ and I thought, ‘Man, I gotta use that. That’s better.'” It’s a lovely song tracing those noble thoughts about cyclical thoughts and time speeding up and slowing down and putting us back down where we were, the same and different. And it also puts that poetry aside to cut to the chase: “Precious moments like these, they mean the world to me\n\n/ Listen, you’re all fuckin’ freaks, but we’re family / So we do what it takes to be in one place, if just for a day.”\n\nAlong with the more familiar cover chestnuts that also peppered his set, Folds introduced his audience to “You Don’t Have to Be a Santa Claus (When Christmas Comes Around),” a fairly obscure oldie dating back at least to 1955, when the Mills Brothers recorded it. (Folds said it was written during the Great Depression.) “I thought it might be relevant these days because it’s about how you might think about helping someone out on other days besides Christmas, and that at the time was a controversial statement, like it is now, to help someone else out.”\n\nCloser to home, he got at what it’s like to be truly solitary at Christmas — or at least other than the companionship of a pet — with his original “Maurice,” written in Nashville in “one of those really everything-looks-the-same sort of suburban neighborhoods that’s not that inspiring. And all the neighbors had the same exact Christmas decorations in their front yard — an inflatable Santa that’s about two stories high and an inflatable reindeer next door; every House down the street almost had the same thing in the front of the yard. Maurice fucking hated the reindeer. He said so many inappropriate things to them in their reindeer language… Our yard was right next to I-40, which comes out here too. And Maurice would dig holes in the snow, and I sort of imagined he was trying to dig a path out.”\n\nThe funnier songs of the past had their own stories. “Bitch Went Nutz” was about a young, conservative lawyer on the rise inviting a liberal barista to be his date at the office Christmas party, only to have her wind up in a screaming political argument with his right-wing colleagues. “Bizarre Christmas Incident” was written as his first misguided attempt at an end-titles theme for “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”; he regaled the Blue Note audience with the tale of how horror-stricken the music supervisor was when he turned it in: “Ben Folds, it’s a fucking kids movie. I’m not showing this to Ron Howard!” He then followed that in concert with the much more appropriate song he turned around in the next 24 hours that successfully made it into the movie, “Lonely Christmas Eve.”\n\nMost plaintive was a song he co-wrote with Nick Hornby, “Picture Window,” about the celebrated novelist and his wife spending New Year’s Eve with their chronically ill son in a London hospital room. The refrain: “You know what hope is? / Hope is a bastard, hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease / Hope comes near you / Kick its backside / Got no place in days like these.” The holiday season doesn’t get any more sobering than that, notwithstanding the Blue Note’s drink minimum.\n\nWhat do you do after that full spectrum of holiday fare than sing “The Christmas Song”? Along with, come the encore, unseasonal chestnuts from his own catalog, like “Philosophy,” from his more keyboard-pounding Ben Folds Era, before circling back to Charlie Brown with “Christmas Time Is Here,” sung by duet partner Lindsey Craft, to send the audience out into the non-chill on a note of buzzed tranquility.\n\nFolds remains one of our most reliable songwriters, so it’s not surprising that his Christmas material would be as solid as the rest — and that he, unlike most of his contemporaries, would recognize that the mass audience’s hunger for seasonal songs is something worth sating. Because, if nothing else, it does represent a twelfth of our lives, give or take. He has a song called “Sleepwalking Through Christmas,” but it’s to his credit he doesn’t sleepwalk through the task of coming up with this stuff. Here’s hoping for “Sleigher 2” and a perennial touring season.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:43:23 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T02:20:43.588076"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.\n\nAfter nearly a decade, Stranger Things fans finally have some answers about the Upside Down and the supernatural forces that have been plaguing Hawkins since Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) disappeared on November 6, 1983.\n\nThe second volume of the series’ final season unveils most of the secrets that creators Matt and Ross Duffer have been keeping from just about everyone since Season 1, including the fact that the Upside Down has actually been a wormhole to another dimension this entire time.\n\n“We’ve known it was a wormhole since Season 1, but it’s one thing to say it, and it’s another to try to figure out how to visualize such an abstract concept,” Ross told Deadline.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe Wormhole\n\nIn the first two of three episodes, Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), Steve (Joe Keery) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) are searching for clues about what could be behind the massive, flesh-like wall they’ve discovered surrounding the Upside Down-version of their town. They find answers inside Hawkins Lab, but not the ones they were expecting.\n\nAt the end of Episode 5, “Shock Jock,” Dustin discovers one of Dr. Brenner’s (Matthew Modine) journals at the same time that Nancy and Jonathan make it to the roof of the lab to find a mysterious presence floating above it. Dustin realizes far too late that neither Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) nor Holly (Nell Fisher) — nor anyone for that matter — are behind the wall, because the wall is actually holding the whole place together. Before he can warn Nancy and Jonathan, the older Wheeler aims her shotgun at the mass on the roof and sends a sweeping shockwave through the Upside Down, ripping a gash in the wall of the wormhole. It’s at that moment that viewers finally get a glimpse of what it looks like from afar.\n\nL to R: Joe Keery as Steve Harrington and Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson in ‘Stranger Things’ 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\n“I think, ultimately, we really wanted it to have that hourglass shape, because we thought that was the simplest way to communicate such a big idea to the audience,” Ross explained. “But to do that, we had to zoom out. I can’t remember how many miles away visual effects figured out that we were by the end in order to see the full shape, but we had to go way out.”\n\n“We’re very far [away],” Matt laughed.\n\nContinued Ross: “Generally, we try to stay within the characters’ perspectives, but that was an instance where we thought to illustrate this best to the audience, we had to leave the characters’ perspectives for a moment, just to show the enormity of this whole thing.”\n\nIt’s thanks to Dustin that viewers, and the rest of the crew in Hawkins, won’t get lost in the theoretical physics of it all. After they make it out of the Upside Down, Dustin draws a diagram on the DJ booth at WSQK to illustrate what they’re up against. He explains that the mass that Nancy shot was exotic matter, and it’s the only thing keeping the wormhole intact.\n\n‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\n“[The Duffers] literally drew that diagram at the season pitch out two years ago, because they understood, even then, that we would need visual aids,” Shawn Levy, who directed Episodes 6 and 7 with the brothers, said. “I’m so grateful that they had Dustin draw that exact same diagram in the show that the Duffers had used to explain the show years before we shot Season 5.”\n\nThe creators don’t credit themselves with devising that explanation though, nor with the flashlight and slinky that Steve uses to help the group understand how they might use the radio tower to get to the alternate dimension that Dustin has named “The Abyss.”\n\n“One of our writers, Paul Dictor, his superpower is the harder sci-fi aspects of the show. He’s read every hard sci-fi book that there is,” Matt said. “As far as [when] it comes to this stuff, he’s smarter than Ross and I are, so he’s playing these things, and Ross and I are basically the Steve in the room going, ‘Huh?’ Illustrations help a lot. So we take a lot of those conversations that we have in the room and the way we help everybody understand it and map it onto the show.”\n\nThe Exotic Matter\n\nSpeaking of the exotic matter, as Nancy and Jonathan make their way toward the roof, they realize the entire building seems to be melting. Funnily enough, the melting lab was born not from any attachment to accuracy of an encounter with the theoretical sciences, but from a desire to put the characters in a life-threatening situation that may force them to have a conversation that they’d long been avoiding.\n\n“All we knew was that we wanted the lab to be melting, and weirdly, actually, that idea came less because we thought it was cool, and more from it kind of all revolved around, or started with, that scene between Nancy and Jonathan. We knew we wanted to put them in a life-or-death situation,” Matt explained.\n\nAfter Nancy shoots the exotic matter, the writhing ball of energy becomes even more ferocious, melting the top of the lab at a more rapid rate. She and Jonathan find themselves trapped inside a room as the roof melts around them, threatening to swallow them whole. It’s at that moment that Jonathan decides to come clean about the engagement ring he’s been carrying around this whole time.\n\nExcept, he doesn’t propose. Instead, he admits that he thinks maybe they aren’t meant to be after all, and he believes Nancy knows that deep down as well.\n\n“One of the references was Almost Famous, just like a way less comedic moment than Almost Famous when they’re on the plane and they’re about to crash, and they all confess to this, because why not? You’re about to die. So we liked that moment. Titanic was a slight reference — they both now are able to fit on the table,” Matt revealed. “So we started from there and reverse engineered what would be a situation that would present that kind of moment for them, and we came up with a melting lab.”\n\nThen comes the work of actually making the lab look like it’s melting, which required intense collaboration between the visual effects department, production designer Chris Trujillo, and art director Sean Brennan.\n\n“It stressed everybody out,” Matt laughs. “Nobody liked the melting lab idea, not because [of] the concept, but no one actually wanted to do it.”\n\nThe final scene does include some computer-generated visual effects, although the Duffers lament “it was intended to be no visual effects.”\n\nThe production had developed a special “goo-like substance” to funnel into that room so that the scene was entirely practical. Unfortunately, when it came time to produce it at such a large scale, things did not pan out as intended, requiring some post-production magic.\n\nSTRANGER THINGS: SEASON 5.

Courtesy of Netflix /Netflix © 2025\n\n“I think they tested it in too small of a batch, because by the time we had — I don’t know how many gallons of it that were needed to flood that room — it was much too thin. I mean, it wasn’t thick at all,” Matt recalled. “It was basically gray water, which was a big problem. So Nat and Charlie just acted it out [and] moved more slowly through it, and then we had ILM, who did a lot of visual effects on the final season, [adjust it]. I don’t know how they did it. They developed some sort of formula to fix it and make everything look thick. Obviously, they did all this incredible liquid simulation, at the end of the day. So it’s a real mix between practical and visual effects. It’s not, maybe, the showiest of our visual effects this season [but it] was one of the ones that blew us away.”\n\nThe Abyss…and Its Connection to Eleven\n\nThe wormhole, Dustin says, connects Hawkins to another dimension that he calls “The Abyss.” This is where be believes all of the monsters — the demogorgons, the Mind Flayer, Vecna — have all been coming from. It’s also why they haven’t been able to find Vecna in any of their crawls over the last two years. He’s not in the Upside Down at all. He’s actually thousands of yards above them, recovering in this alternate dimension, and that is where he’s keeping all those kids, including Holly. Those who have seen The First Shadow may draw connections to one Dimension X.\n\nL-R: Linnea Berthelsen as Kali, Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven, and David Harbour as Jim Hopper in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nVolume 2 does give a glimpse at this other dimension, when Holly briefly escapes Vecna’s clutches and tries to make a run for it. Outside of his lair, the world looks barren and deserted, save for a few glowing red rifts in the ground where the world is connected to the Upside Down.\n\nIt’s certainly satisfying to get the answers about the Upside Down that have evaded audiences for so long, but, in some ways, all of these explanations come with a new set of questions. What is this alternate dimension? Why is Vecna so hellbent on merging it with the human world? Is this where Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) sent him all those years ago?\n\nThe show has been alluding to the fact that the U.S. government’s been locked in some sort of arms race with Russia to access this alternate dimension, likely to use whatever lurks there as weapons of mass destruction. The Vol. 2 episodes also reveal that the government has once again started experimenting on babies in utero to create more supernatural humans like Eleven and Kali, using the latter’s blood. It hasn’t been working, though, which is why they’ve been after Eleven this whole time. They believe that her blood holds the key to creating more kids like her.\n\nL to R: David Harbour as Jim Hopper and Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhile the pieces are starting to fall into place, there are a couple of dots left to connect on this front, which the Duffers promise will happen in the two-hour finale.\n\n“The goal is to tie up the remaining loose ends and answer any questions that remain,” Ross teases. “There are a few specifically big ones…Henry and his backstory, and then Eleven and what all this means for her and Kali.”\n\nThe Stranger Things finale arrives on December 31.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 02:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T02:20:44.276574"}

Volume 2 of the final season gets into the real nitty gritty of what the Upside Down actually is and sets the stage for the final battle with Will (Noah Schnapp), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) etc. vs. Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower).\n\nEven more so than with Volume 1, Stranger Things: The First Shadow heavily connects to Episodes 505, 506 and 507. As Vecna’s whereabouts come into focus, Max (Sadie Sink) and Holly (Nell Fisher) happen upon some traumatic memories in his mindscape and he unveils his grand plan with the 12 children he has kidnapped.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThose needing a refresher of what lore has been established in previous seasons need look no further, because like we did with Volume 1, we will explain the connections building up to these three stacked episodes.\n\nEpisode 5 – “Shock Jock”\n\nL-R: Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair and Priah Ferguson as Erica Sinclair in ‘Stranger Things’ Courtesy of Netflix\n\nAs viewers learned in the epic cliffhanger ending of Episode 504, aptly titled “Sorcerer,” Will has powers, and as Mike explains them through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons, there difference between his abilities and those of Eleven or Vecna. Will being a sorcerer means that his powers are innate, drawn from a higher being (in this case, Vecna himself). He doesn’t have to study or practice much in order to access his abilities, as evidenced by the relative ease with which he tapped into the hive mind. According to D&D, a wizard has to intensely study to gather intelligence and use their powers. Wizards are reliant on preparation, whereas sorcerers can summon their talent at will.\n\nParticles & The Hive Mind\n\nThis connection comes into play when Joyce (Winona Ryder) suggests her son attempt to jack back into the Hive Mind and use Vecna’s powers against him. In order to do this, the Sinclair siblings come up with two different plans, and Lucas provides a good explanation for the way the hive mind is all connected. While popping some popcorn, he posits that the dormant particles within all hive mind participants can be energized or galvanized to make the connection more apparent. As has been key since Season 2, or really Season 1 when you think about it, particles seemingly from the Upside Down have connected Will, demogorgons, The Mind Flayer and more for better or worse. In Season 2 at the end of Episode 4, “Will the Wise,” the Mind Flayer infests Will with its shadowy essence, making him “The Spy.”\n\nLucas theorizes that these particles were also in Max’s step brother Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery), when the Mind Flayer possessed him in Season 3, which is why, when the kids trapped him in the pool sauna and cranked up the heat, it exposed inky black veins all over Billy’s body. Similar veins appeared on young Will’s neck in Season 2 when Joyce, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy (Natalie Dyer) did something similar to Will, exposing his body to intense heat to expel the Mind Flayer from his body.\n\nThe veins appear on the dead Demogorgon’s body when Robin (Maya Hawke), Will, Mike, Lucas and co. shock the body to provide a way for Will to invade Vecna’s mind. As of Volume 1’s release, the gross fleshy tube that attaches to Will and the 12 children’s mouths apparently particalizes them with Mind Flayer molecules.\n\nVecna’s Plan\n\nMeanwhile, in his eerily tranquil mindscape, Henry, posing as Mr. Whatsit, tries to persuade the 12 children he has taken that Max is a monster waiting in the woods. According to Henry, she is under control of the Black Thing, like from A Wrinkle in Time (The IT). He wants them to believe she is doing its bidding and would try to enslave the children, too. Sounds like he is really projecting himself and his intentions onto Max. He tells them, though, that his goal is to bring them “back to the light.”\n\nIn Season 4, we learned that Eleven sent Henry back to Dimension X, which is the desert-like expanse in which he found The Mind Flayer and demogorgons. He had initially been transported their by powerful technology he stumbled on when he was younger, returning with unexplained abilities. This is where The First Shadow comes into play, because that story fleshes out Henry’s childhood and the moments in Rachel, Nevada, when he stumbled upon the technology — we’ll get to this later because the memory itself appears in Episode 6.\n\nDr. Kay’s Motives\n\nLinda Hamilton as Dr. Kay in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5.\n\nBack with Eleven, Kali (Linnea Berthelssen) and Hopper (David Harbour), viewers learn what Kali knew about Henry — everything except that he was still alive. Those who didn’t skip Episode 8, “The Lost Sister,” in Season 2 will remember that Kali’s powers manifest differently than Eleven’s and Henry’s in that she can cast illusions and make the mind see things that aren’t there. She does this while she and El and Hopper get away from the military base in the Upside Down, casting a mirage of herself still connected to that horrific machine she was immobilized in.\n\nKali reveals that she previously tried to escape her confines, and in doing so, she discovered a series of pregnant woman being infused with her blood. She could tell that it was not having its desired effect, though, because the women were sick and dying and asking Kali for help. She realizes Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) was replicating Dr. Brenner’s experiments with blood transfusions in an attempt to create children with super powers. She even cast a vision for Eleven showing Henry hooked up to a pregnant woman, which was “Papa’s program” and how he created children like Kali and Eleven (008 and 011), giving them powers through Henry’s blood. She hints that since her blood wasn’t working, Kay is after Eleven for her blood because she could be more like Henry.\n\nDustin Connects the Dots\n\nDustin, Jonathan, Nancy and Steve (Joe Keery) have taken it upon themselves to investigate the Hawkins Lab in the Upside Down after Dustin determined that to be the center of the flesh-like wall encompassing the town. In the lab, he finds a map exactly like the one he drew to determine the central point, raising some red flags about the origins of the Upside Down.\n\nHe tries to tell Jonathan and Nancy not to disturb what he thought could be a shield generator, similar to the Death Star in Return of the Jedi (1983), but it wasn’t what he thought it was.\n\nWe learn throughout these episodes that the characters have been all wrong about what the Upside Down is and what’s been happening to them since Will disappeared on November 6, 1983. But, some of the most important lore to remember here is actually about Dr. Brenner’s experiments.\n\nSee our Vol. 1 mythological explainer if you need a refresher on Season 4 Episode 7, “The Massacre at Hawkins Lab,” which continues to heavily come into play in Volume 2.\n\nEpisode 6 – “Escape from Camazotz”\n\nL-R: Sadie Sink as Max Mayfield and Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe Duffer brothers teased 506 as an emotional episode, and boy does it deliver while also dispensing truth nuggets that change the perspective of the Stranger Things universe.\n\nDustin Explains The Upside Down\n\nGaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5\n\nAfter he and Steve physically brawl, putting their relationship on the brink of collapse, the pair reunite to try and get to Jonathan and Nancy’s aid after Nancy shoots a suspicious force-field atop the roof of the Hawkins Lab in the Upside Down.\n\nTurns out, The Upside Down is a wormhole that bridges Hawkins and Dimension X, where Henry’s powers originated. After going through Dr. Brenner’s mysterious journal that describes the angry red ball as exotic matter holding the wormhole together, Dustin reveals that everything they’ve thought about the alternate world is wrong and not due to dark magic, but science.\n\nDustin further diagrams all of this for the entire team in Episode 7.\n\nVecna Makes Will Spy One Last Time\n\nIn “Shock Jock,” Will hacks into Vecna and is able to stall him so that Max and Holly can escape after he threatens to kill Max and trap Holly once again. The invasion gives them enough time to escape, but once Vecna regains control, he uses his connection with Will to find Max’s body in the real world and send the demodogs after her.\n\nRemember, Will has been “spying” for Vecna, and for the Mind Flayer, since Season 2. We broke that down in our Volume 1 refresher.\n\nMax, meanwhile, is now out in the desert beyond the caves where she sheltered with Holly. She doesn’t know that it’s Will who has overtaken Vecna, assuming it’s Eleven, since she’s previously witnessed El’s ability to “piggyback” into other people’s minds. Since she and Holly aren’t privy to what’s going on back home, they have no idea that Will has these newfound powers.\n\nMax & Holly Stumble Upon Henry’s Traumatic Memory\n\nOut in the desert, where Holly draws the connection that the shape of the caves mimics the aperture in the spyglass, an M of sorts, she and Max literally almost fall down a mineshaft. M marks the spot for the reason Henry won’t venture into the caves — they witness his memory of stumbling upon the scientist who had defected from a government experiment. This is where Stranger Things: The First Shadow comes into play.\n\nWhen Henry finds the scientist, he’s clutching a briefcase that contains stolen technology from an experiment that accidentally sent a group of men to a place they’ve called Dimension X. We know that Dr. Brenner’s dad was part of this experiment, and it’s basically the entire reason that Brenner has been experimenting on kids — to try to recreate that happy accident and get back to Dimension X.\n\nThe scientist is very paranoid while Henry, dressed in his boy scout uniform, only wants to help the poor man. After the man shoots Henry in the hand, Henry bashes his skull in out of fear for his life. The young boy opens the briefcase that the scientist attempted to guard with his life. Unfortunately, the camera pans away once he opens the briefcase, and we don’t get to see what happens next, but those that know Henry’s backstory can make some educated guesses.\n\nIn Stranger Things: The First Shadow, we learn Dr. Brenner was able to track Henry down because he left his spyglass in those caves. That’s how Brenner got Henry in his clutches, realizing that Henry had gone to Dimension X and returned with a unique blood type, a different personality and new powers. Season 4 reveals that Henry was 001, the first child that led to the MKUltra experiments where Brenner created more children with supernatural powers.\n\nPresumably, all the answers about what happened to Henry in those caves are ahead in the upcoming finale.\n\nAn Emotional Escape\n\nWhen Max and Holly make it into the red hellscape in Vecna’s mind, Max quickly realizes that she and Holly can’t escape together because their bodies are in different places. She gives Holly a rousing pep talk where Holly embraces her little figurine — Holly the Heroic — that Mike gave her. This helps her move past the fear that froze her when the Demogorgon attacked her mom and when Vecna almost killed Max to believe in herself and her power.\n\nMind you, this is happening as demodogs close in on Max, Robin, Vickie (Amybeth McNulty) and an unconscious Max’s body as they hide in a laundry room below Hawkins Memorial Hospital in a scene quite reminiscent of the velociraptors closing in on Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello) in Jurassic Park (1993). Lucas doesn’t want to turn off the radio playing Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” because he believes it’s the only thing guiding Max back to him, but the sound tips off the demodogs as to where they are hiding. The song saved Max in Season 4, Episode 4, “Dear Billy” and she had previously hinted that she could have escaped Vecna’s mindscape earlier if the tape recording hadn’t needed to rewind. But, as we learn in the final moments of Episode 6, it was never about the song, specifically, but the way it provided her an enduring connection to everything that she loved, which is what really gave her the ability to escape.\n\nEpisode 7 – “The Bridge”\n\nL-R: Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson and Joe Keery as Steve Harrington in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5\n\n“The Bridge” sets the team up for a crazy confrontation with Vecna as he aims to merge worlds by drawing The Abyss across the wormhole that is The Upside Down.\n\nHolly Wakes Up in Dimension X\n\nAfter Max wakes up to an emotional welcome from Lucas, Robin and Vickie, we finally learn where Vecna is keeping the 12 children hostage — a skeletal looking fortress in an alternate dimension, where they are attached to fleshy feeding tubes. He hangs in the air connected to similar tubes, seemingly drawing energy from the kids. When Holly comes back into her own body, she rips the tube from her mouth, coughs up those pesky black particles and tries to escape from the fortress. Vecna tracks her down and somehow pulls her back from her free fall towards the Hawkins Lab, where Jonathan and Nancy see her briefly before she’s yanked back into the sky.\n\nKay Fully Admits Her Big Plan\n\nIn a cut to Dr. Kay in The Upside Down lab where she blames Lt. Akers for the kidnapping of the 12 children, Kay screeches that if she had already found “the girl” (meaning Eleven), the demogorgons and other monsters from Dimension X would be in Russia fighting the Soviets, instead of threatening the existence of Americans.\n\nThis line is key, because it ties the whole show back around, particularly shining a light on the Russia plot lines in Season 4, where they were opening a gate in Kamchatka to try and replicate the success the Americans had had in harnessing the mysterious powers and beings lurking in these dark dimensions. This further explains why the Russians first came to Hawkins in Season 3 to try and crack open a closed gate underneath Starcourt Mall.\n\nThe fight for psychic children and access to the Upside Down and Dimension X can be boiled down to an arms race, of sorts. However, there are still a few missing pieces left to be answered on this front in the finale.\n\nDustin Diagrams The Upside Down\n\nBack at WSQK, Dustin explains the Upside Down and its connection to a dimension he’s dubbed “The Abyss.” D&D players like Erica and Mr. Clarke know The Abyss as a realm of chaos and true evil, and that’s what this dimension looks to be.\n\nDustin theorizes that Eleven created the wormhole by making psychic contact with the demogorgon back in Season 1, which did open the gate, or rift, that led to a lot of the creatures coming into Hawkins. As Henry has already explained it vaguely to his prisoners, he wants to merge Dimension X into Hawkins and create a new world.\n\nThe team comes up with a plan to counter this action, and Steve Harrington is at the center of it for once instead of being the one who needs an explanation. Using a flashlight and a Slinky, he suggests they wait for Vecna to draw the worlds closer and let him until the top of the radio tower is poking into the dimension, giving them direct access. Dustin adds one note to the plan – to drop a bomb on the Upside Down as they escape one final time and, hopefully, do away with the whole mess.\n\nWill’s Coming Out\n\nNoah Schnapp as Will Byers in ‘Stranger Things’ Netflix\n\nIn maybe the most heartfelt moment of Season 5 so far, Will braved coming out as gay to not only his close friends but the entire ensemble that has been fighting demons by his side since the day he got taken. This was prompted by a vision Vecna showed Will of a future where his friends worried about him living in a world not friendly to gay men, ultimately pushing his loved ones away as well. Will casted aside the shame so that he was no longer vulnerable to Vecna, who we know preys not just on weakness but specifically on guilt and shame in order to exploit his victims.\n\nWill’s sexuality hadn’t been outright confirmed, but seeds were planted in the earlier seasons when Joyce pointed out the slurs that kids called Will, including queer. Will’s bullies, and even his friends, also often made jokes abut how he didn’t like girls. In Season 3, when Will wanted to play D&D while all his friends would have rather hung out with their respective girlfriends, Mike made a particularly hurtful comment, saying he was sorry Will didn’t like girls.\n\nWill’s acceptance of his own sexuality, as well as his ability to make peace with the fact that Mike will likely not reciprocate those feelings, seems to be key to defeating Vecna in the looming finale.\n\nRELATED: Noah Schnapp Teases ‘Stranger Things’ Conclusion For Will & Mike’s Relationship: “Real, Authentic Representation”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:05:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T02:20:44.564031"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Vol. 2.\n\nThe penultimate episode of Stranger Things 5 offers fans a moment that they’ve been hoping for all season: a reunion between Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink).\n\nAt the very end of Episode 6, “Escape from Camazotz,” Max finally manages to make it out of Henry’s mindscape and wakes up from the coma she’s been in for nearly two years in the basement of the hospital, where Lucas had brought her to save her from the Demo dogs that Vecna had sent to kill her. The two share an emotional and vulnerable moment together as Max finds her way back to reality.\n\n“That moment, it almost felt real, because I wasn’t around her for so long,” McLaughlin told Deadline. Besides a few scenes of Lucas at Max’s bedside, this was the first moment they’d shared on-screen all season.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe scene is one of several tear-jerkers in the second volume of episodes, released on Christmas Day. In addition to a whirlwind of emotional sequences, the back half of the season is finally beginning to provide some answers about the Upside Down and the evils that Hawkins has been facing this whole time.\n\nIn the interview below, McLaughlin discusses working on these three episodes, including filming that scene with Sink and another equally moving one with Noah Schnapp, and what’s to come as the beloved series comes to an end.\n\nSTRANGER THINGS: SEASON 5.

Courtesy of Netflix /Netflix © 2025 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: I hear you’re about to go watch the finale with your castmates. How are you feeling about that?\n\nCALEB MCLAUGHLIN: I have a lot of anxiety and mixed emotions going into it. I think I’ve been, not uneasy, but I’m happy…but then now it’s the last content I will see of the show. So it’s a weird feeling. Not gonna lie, honestly, I’m like, I want to see it, but I wish it was two weeks ago to where I had more time for the anticipation of it all. But now it’s almost two hours into that moment, and it’s crazy.\n\nDEADLINE: Do you think you’ve made peace with the show ending?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I think I’ve definitely made peace with the show ending. I believe all great things come to an end, and to cherish the moment is for it to end. I think the story has done so well throughout the years, and it’s gonna go down in history as a classic, a show that people loved. I’m just happy. I’m happy to be a part of the legacy. So I’m happy to put this in a nice safe as one of the great things that I’ve done and move on to the next.\n\nDEADLINE: There is much to discuss from these episodes, but first I wanted to ask you about working with Sadie again on that emotional scene at the beginning of Episode 7 when Max and Lucas are finally reunited.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I mean, even her being in the coma in Episode 2, I guess she was still there, but last year, we rarely saw her. That moment, it almost felt real, because I wasn’t around her for so long. You miss your friend when you’re on set. You miss the camaraderie you both have. So I think with that, seeing that emotion that I had [access], to the state of mind that I had to be in, was a different emotion from Season 4, when he was losing her. In this moment, it was more of an emotion of relief and joy…it wasn’t sadness, it was happiness. But then also, at the same time, that feeling of loss, because now everything that he was feeling, he can now have this release.\n\nDEADLINE: Yeah, almost like he could finally let some of his emotions go after feeling like he had to be strong for her and for his friends for so long.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, he was able to be there for her when that happened. Like, ‘I never gave up. I never doubted a moment.’ And also, like, even I felt that he was still trying to hold it in [when she woke up], because he didn’t want to be the one crying. He had to be strong for her.\n\nDEADLINE: After Max wakes up and they rescue the rest of the crew from the Upside Down, the back half of Episode 7 features some of the first scenes with the entire cast together like this in quite some time. How did those moments feel to film?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Oh, man, it was hectic. I think every season, we always have that — the beginning, everyone’s around each other, and then we separate to go on our own journeys, and then we come back at the end. Last season, I was kind of not looking forward to those moments, because usually when we go to those moments, we know the show is ending. When you see everyone’s face and you’re having a good time, you start realizing time is going by. You see that the time that you had is no longer going to be there. So it was one of those. It was a lot of fun, because I had a lot of fun last season. It was my favorite time filming, because I got closer to everyone… just because of how big the show’s gotten, just these moments towards the end, is so much bigger than any moment we’ve ever had on the show. So I think that was spectacular.\n\nDEADLINE: Can you tell me a little about filming Noah’s coming out scene? It’s a really emotional scene and one that fans have been anticipating for some time. You all give very emotional and generous performances in that moment.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Being on the show for so long, and knowing everyone’s had other ups and downs and, just me being a friend, just wanting to be there and knowing I’ll always be there for a friend, I think that scene was a moment that felt genuine. We would be there for Noah. We would be there for anyone in their hard times and their biggest secret moments where they want to be vulnerable. I think it’s important for stories like that to be told, to have those vulnerable moments. I mean, of course, we were acting, but it was important — even when we weren’t shown, we were there off screen, we [were] there behind the camera…So I think that scene was very special. Noah killed it. His performance was amazing. We had to do it a couple of times, and then we did it on another day as well, and he was able to bring it each time. Being able to be there as his friend, on and off screen, supporting him, especially not even just what the scene is, but just a big moment for an actor to tap into that emotion, I think being there for another actor, being there for a friend is always something that — I would want someone to be there for me. So I was just happy to be there in that moment and see him flourish.\n\nDEADLINE: What was your reaction to learning some of the details about the Upside Down and the mythology you all have been building for five seasons?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I think it was a whirlwind. It was a lot of shocking moments. I remember reading it and listening to the Duffers read the script. I was like, ‘Oh, this is good. Oh, yeah. This is how you bring this to a close.’ Sometimes TV shows or movies will create something, they’ll create this world that’s already good, and then make it more [complicated], and then it becomes less meaningful. I think these moments made it more meaningful, and it made it more grounded.\n\nDEADLINE: How was it to watch it and see what it really looked like? Because there’s a lot going on that Lucas doesn’t witness, or that none of the characters do, like the wormhole.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I didn’t realize that was a thing until I watched it. There’s so much detail in this next volume, and there’s a lot of things you can miss even while reading, because they don’t explain how it is. It’ll be like a simple sentence, like, ‘we zoom out and there’s this wormhole,’ right? But then when you see it, you understand what they’re explaining. It’s a different perspective. I think that’s what was sick.\n\nDEADLINE: What can you tease about the finale?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: It’ll be our biggest yet. There will be a lot of range of emotions, but you’ll be satisfied with the story.\n\nDEADLINE: What are you looking forward to post-Stranger Things?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I’m excited for the new journey. I think being in the industry, being on the show for so long, there’s things that you’re like, ‘oh, I need to do this. I need to do that.’ It’s been full circle to where I realized I’m already doing it, and I just need to keep doing it and following my heart and knowing who I am, and I’m excited, because I feel like this is only the beginning in life, in my career…future projects next. Literally right after this press tour, I’m going into another press run for this movie I’m doing called Goat, an animated movie called Goat. So that’s the first movie I’m doing at the top of the year, so that’s a new beginning, and it’s also a wonderful story about a little goat wanting to be the, no pun intended, greatest of all time. Actually, the pun was intended. But yeah, so I’m excited for the future.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 03:45:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T03:48:04.911869"}

After four-and-a-half seasons of questions prompted by “Stranger Things,” in Volume 2 of the show’s fifth and final season, creators Matt and Ross Duffer offered answers aplenty, while also setting up the potentially tragic stakes of the series finale. That deadly new question — whether there’s any world in which Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) can live without her blood being the key ingredient for future weapons of mass destruction — will be answered when the show’s series finale, “The Rightside Up,” which drops on Dec. 31. But for now, let’s enumerate the big pieces of “Stranger Things” mythology we now understand after seeing “Shock Jock,” “Escape From Camazotz” and “The Bridge,” as well as how the show has continued to tie up emotional threads within this tight group of friends who’ve become a large, extended found family. Top of mind is how Will (Noah Schnapp) finally — finally! — comes out to his mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), his brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and his friends, as they all geared up to head into the Upside Down to fight Henry/Vecna/One (Jamie Campbell Bower) for the final battle. In “Sorcerer,” the climactic conclusion of Volume 1, Will harnessed his connection to Vecna, which had been forged when he was kidnapped into the Upside Down on Nov. 6, 1983. Channeling his Eleven-like powers, Will slayed Demogorgons, stopping them in mid-air, and the episode’s final image was him wiping his bloody nose (as Eleven does) from the exertion of it. Noah Schnapp Courtesy of Netflix Will had received those powers directly from Vecna: The first scene of Volume 1 revealed that Vecna plugged him into the hive while he was in the Upside Down. Will can use his powers for good, as we see, but Vecna can also use his connection to Will against him. He’s been creating the tunnels under Hawkins with his mind, using Will as his spy, just as he was in the second season. In Volume 2, Vecna uses Will to spy again to see where Max (Sadie Sink) is — a hospital bed in Hawkins — which puts her in physical danger. Not wanting any secrets to come between him and his friends, Will decides to come out to them, first by saying, “I don’t like girls,” and then going on to say that Vecna showed him a world in which he was alone because of his sexuality. “It just felt so real,” Will says, through tears. “You’ll never lose me,” Joyce tells Will, as Jonathan and then all of Will’s friends say the same, reinforcing their love and support for him before engulfing him in a hug. Other interpersonal storylines resolved in Volume 2 are the ongoing questions of what would happen to Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Jonathan as a couple, and why exactly Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) has been so angry at Steve (Joe Keery). After Nancy shoots what turns out to be the exotic matter that’s holding the Upside Down together, it causes a literal meltdown that threatens to drown them in goo. So, Nancy and Jonathan get real with one another, confessing everything from her hatred of The Clash to the fact that he never applied to Emerson for college (and that she knew). Jonathan takes out the engagement ring he’s been carrying around in a John Coltrane cassette, and says, “Nancy Wheeler, will you not marry me?” They remain, of course, bonded forever – but just as friends from now on. Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer Courtesy of Netflix Speaking of friends, after getting into a physical fight in the basement of the lab, Steve and Dustin separate in an angry snit. But after hearing the ruckus on the upper floors, Steve runs up the stairs to help Nancy, recklessly so. Dustin breaks down, saying he can’t lose Steve after he’s already lost Eddie for trying to be a hero. As Dustin sobs, Steve hugs him, finally understanding why Dustin has been protecting himself from getting hurt again by putting up a hostile front. As for the larger “Stranger Things” mysteries, it’s Dustin who figures out, having found the journals of Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine), that the Upside Down isn’t its own world or own dimension, but instead is a wormhole: a bridge to another world, one that Dustin names “the Abyss.” The Abyss, that red, Mars-like space we’ve seen before, is where Eleven sent Henry when she was a small child in Hawkins Lab after he revealed to her that he wanted her by his side in his plot to change (aka destroy!) the world. It’s where Henry evolved into Vecna, and where, at Brenner’s instruction, Eleven found Henry by using her powers, creating the Upside Down. “When you made remote contact with the Abyss, the bridge formed,” Dustin tells Eleven and the rest of the group as they formulate their plan. “And ever since, Henry and his army of monsters have been using it to cross right back into Hawkins.” The Abyss is also where Vecna retreated after he was nearly defeated in Season 4, Dustin says, to “lick his wounds” — which is why Eleven couldn’t find him. The show also begins to reveal how Henry’s powers came to be before the Creel family moved to Hawkins in the late 1950s. Max and Holly (Nell Fisher) tour Henry’s memories in an effort to get them out of Vecna’s mindscape, which Holly has named Camazotz, using the terminology of her favorite book, “A Wrinkle in Time.” They end up at the bottom of a mine shaft, watching as young Henry comes upon a panicked stranger protecting a silver briefcase — he shoots Henry in the hand so Henry, just a child, beats him to death with a rock. (This development is alluded to in the stage play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” when Brenner, Henry’s keeper after he murdered his parents, mentions that Henry had been found in a cave in Nevada after going missing on his 8th birthday. After that, Brenner says, Henry was different.) Henry opens the case, but we don’t see what happens after that — because Max pulls Holly away. “We will see that briefcase again,” Ross Duffer says. “You’re going to get the answers to those questions in the final episode.” Nell Fisher and Sadie Sink Courtesy of Netflix Henry’s powers (and their transmissibility) are essential to Eleven’s existential dilemma heading into the series finale. Kali/Eight (Linnea Berthelsen) reveals to Eleven she’d been held in a military lab because Dr. Kay was transfusing her blood into pregnant women in the hope that the fetuses would eventually develop her telekinetic powers. That’s how she learned, Kali then tells Eleven, that Brenner had similarly infused the biological mothers of all the kids in Hawkins Lab with Henry’s blood — resulting in Eleven becoming his perfect replica (and the other kids also developing powers). “They will find you,” Kali says. “And they will create more. Like Henry.” Those are the stakes of “The Right Side Up,” the Duffers say. Is Kali correct in saying that she and Eleven should hang back in the Upside Down as it’s destroyed, removing the threat of them ever being used again as weapons? Or is Mike (Finn Wolfhard) right when he says to Eleven that they’re the ones who get to decide how things will end? “You, me, Lucas, Will and Dustin,” Mike tells her. “Because this is our story.”\n\n“How can there be a happy ending here?” Matt Duffer asks rhetorically. “That’s the question going into the finale.”\n\nIn the interview below, the Duffers delve into that question, as well as writing Will’s coming out scene, when they decided what the Upside Down is, Henry’s backstory, how Max can help Eleven in the series finale — and much more.\n\nNoah Schnapp Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWill’s coming out scene! For Volume 1, we talked about how you wanted it to be that as Will “began to accept himself,” he’d be able to achieve the kind of strength he needed to access his powers. Did you always know you wanted Will to have a huge coming out scene with everyone as the final battle approached?\n\nRoss Duffer: Will’s coming out is something we’ve been talking about and wanting to do for a very long time. Originally, it was going to be in Season 4, and we just realized we didn’t have the space to do it properly. And I’m glad we didn’t, because it really gave us time to arc an entire season toward this — toward this one moment. And yes, he is starting to embrace himself, which we see in Volume 1.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBut what he realizes is that there’s still something in there that Vecna exploits — which is that he hasn’t told anyone about this. That ultimately led to the coming out scene. Originally, it was just going to be Joyce in the original draft of the outline. And the scene was not hitting properly. We realized that Joyce is an important part of this, but he really needed to do it in front of everyone.\n\n\n\nHow did you work with Noah Schnapp on that scene, both in the writing of it and on the day of filming it?\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: Ross and I spent longer writing that scene, I think, than certainly any other scene this year — if not ever. We were so concerned about getting it right. There were a lot of things that went into it. I mean, we’re definitely nervous about how it’s going to go over with everyone. But not as nervous as we were handing it over to Noah. Because ultimately, it needed to resonate and be truthful for him. We really were writing it to and for Noah. He wrote us sobbing after he read it. So it really worked and resonated for him, which was great.\n\nOn the day, frankly, there wasn’t really much direction at all. Noah spent a long time — I mean, months — prepping for that scene, that moment. Luckily, that script was done well in advance. I know he did a lot of work himself. It was a lot of pressure on the day, because not only are you performing this scene that you know is the most important scene for you in the season, you’re doing it in front of not just a crew, but basically all his fellow actors. And they were all there for him. The only thing we said was, “How do you want us to start? Where do you want the camera to be?”\n\nAnd most of what’s in there is the first take. It’s just one of those moments you always hope for when you’re working with an actor — he seemed to access something incredibly truthful. It didn’t feel like he was acting. I think Noah completely lost himself in that scene, and that take is what wound up in the show.\n\nWill doesn’t actually say, “I’m gay” — the way he frames his coming out is in different ways. Can you talk about how you wanted him to express himself?\n\nRoss Duffer: For us, it was just trying to make sure that the scene felt unique to both Will and unique for a coming out scene. For us, it was about the fears — because that’s what Vecna does. He preys on the fears, which allows us to explore whether it’s someone like Max, who’s dealing with trauma and depression, or in this case, Will.\n\nThe fear is something that Vecna, what he’s talking about, feels really real and grounded to Will, which is not that everyone’s going to make fun of him or be mean to him. It’s that everyone’s going to slowly withdraw from him. Talking about it like that, and then getting the reassurance from them — once we had that, then the arc of the scene seemed to make sense, and it felt very specific to both something that Vecna would do, but also to Will as a character. That’s when it really clicked, and that’s why it also helped to have everyone there, as opposed to just Joyce.\n\nMatt Duffer: I would just add that another thing that helped click it for us, and why he says, “I don’t like girls.” This came about once we added the other actors, his friends, into the scene: It’s about how they are so similar in every way. He’s talking about everything they share in common, and how little difference there is between them, and at the end of the day, there is no difference. They’re the same people they always were. There’s just one thing that’s different about him. That’s what he’s scared of sharing with them. And that’s why it felt right for him to express it that way.\n\nLinnea Berthelsen and Millie Bobby Brown Courtesy of Netflix\n\nSwitching topics! When, in writing the show, did you decide there were two different things, the Upside Down and the Abyss?\n\nMatt Duffer: That was something that I can say was early on. That was all the way back in Season 1: Netflix just wanted us to explain the mythology to them, because we were very adamant early on, “We don’t want to explain it in the show. We like that there’s mystery, and that there’s a lot that you don’t understand by the end of the season.” They said, “That’s fine, but we would like to know.” I think it was actually a really good exercise — we spent quite a bit of time with our writers figuring out exactly what the Upside Down was. We wrote a 20-page mythology document. It wasn’t called the Abyss at that point; it was called Dimension X, which is a Ninja Turtle reference.\n\nBut yeah, that’s been in there, baked in there, for a while. We’ve been holding those cards back for so long; it was a real relief to actually be able to show our hands here.\n\n\n\nCan you talk about creating the life and death stakes for Eleven going into the series finale? That if she survives, the military will just continue to hunt her down and make more of her from Henry’s blood?\n\nRoss Duffer: This is one of the reasons we want to bring Kali back — there’s really been dual threats throughout the run of “Stranger Things.” There is the supernatural threat, which is represented by Vecna this season. But the military has always posed a threat, from Season 1 on. Even when Brenner is gone, he gets continually replaced by someone else. In this case, in Season 5, by Kay. So we needed Kali to represent maybe a more pessimistic, but perhaps realistic, version, compared to Mike’s worldview of we’re gonna have butterflies and rainbows. And Kali’s going, “How is this going to work? And what is the solution here, that you can live a normal life?” That’s really a huge part of Eleven’s journey this season.\n\nSo did Eleven create the Upside Down? Because this is a debate we’ve been having at Variety since Season 4.\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: Oh! Yes. The answer is yes. Not her fault, I would say!\n\n\n\nIt was Brenner’s fault.\n\nMatt Duffer: She was forced to do that.\n\nWhen did you come up with the idea that Brenner had used Henry’s blood to create more Henrys — with El being the most successful manifestation of that — presumably to be Cold War-era weapons?\n\nMatt Duffer: I think that came about when we were working both on the play and Season 4, if I recall. Because so much of it ties into Henry, into One. Once we started to really explore that, we felt that it was interesting to then use that to explain and delve into where these powers actually originated from.\n\n\n\nIs there a way for Eleven not to have Henry’s blood in her?\n\nMatt Duffer: The idea is no, because we like that this is something that’s in her DNA. It’s unchangeable. There’s no magic antidote that’s going to solve this issue. And we like that, because it just creates a very complicated, messy situation.\n\nIt’s very easy to say, “Hey, we’re going to go fight the bad guy and defeat the evil!” But even if they’re able to do that and survive that, there’s this other, almost even darker, more complicated question on the other side of that.\n\nJoe Keery and Gaten Matarazzo Courtesy of Netflix\n\nHow is it that Steve, of all people, came up with the final plan of what they’re going to do?\n\nRoss Duffer: Well, Steve’s grown up a lot over the years. And particularly this season, he’s been beaten up a little bit by Dustin. He’s a little behind a lot of time; he’s like Donnie in “The Big Lebowski” sometimes, where he’s just a step or two behind. But Steve is a smart guy, and I think he’s shown that over the years. As we were working on that penultimate episode, we thought, “Who better to come up with the final — and arguably the most important plan — they’ve ever had than Steve ‘The Hair’ Harrington?'”\n\nMatt Duffer: And his favorite childhood story was “Jack and the Beanstalk.” That’s the other thing.\n\nIs the Abyss/Dimension X, the other world where Henry is, the place he originally entered as a child?\n\nMatt Duffer: Correct. Yes. I don’t think in the show we ever call it Dimension X — maybe that was in a script, and maybe we’ve referred to that in interviews. But it was never officially Dimension X. So that’s now always the Abyss, just to keep things as confusing as possible.\n\nJamie Campbell Bower Courtesy of Netflix\n\nShawn Levy told my colleague Jenny Maas in a postmortem coming out soon that the answer is no to them being the same thing. He said to ask you guys! He said he doesn’t think the Abyss is Dimension X.\n\nMatt Duffer: I’m gonna have to text him and clarify this for him.\n\nThe man with the briefcase that young Henry meets in that mine shaft — is there more to that story of how Henry got his powers that day that we’re going to see in the series finale?\n\nRoss Duffer: Yes, we will see that briefcase again. You’re going to get the answers to those questions in the final episode.\n\nMatt Duffer: You’ve only seen half of that core memory.\n\nI wanted to ask about other beats you wanted in Volume 2 as you wound the show down. We talked about Will coming out — Nancy and Jonathan figure themselves out, Dustin and Steve make up. Can you just talk about tying up threads and what you felt was essential to do?\n\nRoss Duffer: It was really important for us that all of our characters, as they head into the final battle, have really resolved those tensions or conflicts. That they’re all working on the same page — whether those conflicts are external with others, or internal with themselves. Because in our mind, if the party’s actually going to be able to defeat this great evil, they have to be all working at the best of their ability, and be all on the same page. So it was important just to resolve those tensions and conflicts. There’s one left, really.\n\nMatt Duffer: The Eleven one. The Eleven one is sort of the big outstanding issue that has not been resolved going in finale.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown Courtesy of Netflix\n\nMeaning, can Eleven survive and have the world be safe?\n\nMatt Duffer: Yes, exactly. How can there be a happy ending here? That’s the question going into the finale. Is Mike right, or is Kali right?\n\nCan you talk about how you resolved the Nancy-Jonathan story? Like, like an “I choose me” situation?\n\nMatt Duffer: Yeah, that was probably the scene we spent the second longest on. It’s quite a long scene; it’s complicated, what they’re going through. It’s very messy, because they do love each other very much, but we always felt that at the end of the day, they need to let each other go in order to grow as people and be independent.\n\nBut at the same time, there’s a very real — and I think a lot of people experience this — conflict, in the sense that they have gone through something very unique, and in their case, challenging. And how could anyone else ever understand them the way, say, Jonathan understands Nancy or vice versa, having not gone through this? Can they ever form a connection with someone that is as meaningful as this? But also, how do you grow as a person on your own? You need that independence.\n\nSo that was the idea behind the scene, and what we really wanted to explore. We had been planning to get there for a while, just figuring out how to exactly articulate that was challenging. But we’re really proud of that scene and, and specifically, how good Charlie and Natalia are.\n\nWhat was that goo, and why did it stop dripping, or whatever it was doing?\n\nRoss Duffer: We just wanted to put Jonathan and Nancy in a situation where they thought they were going to die — and, of course, don’t. But the backstory is that when the exotic matter, or dark matter, is disturbed, it disrupts the environment around, in this case, the lab, causing it to melt. But at a certain point — as you see earlier in Episode 5, when Jonathan and Nancy are on the upper levels of the lab — they see that this goo, this melted stuff, has hardened. At a certain point, it does harden. And in this case, we show how long it takes.\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: You can think of it like the sun — the exotic matter is circular, and then as it dies down over time, the melting slows and stops. The nightmare scenario for Jonathan and Nancy would be end up like those soldiers you saw in the prior episode, where they get trapped.\n\n\n\nYou guys answered so much in 5, 6 and 7, but —\n\nMatt Duffer: The table is set, so to speak, going into the finale. But the big thing is Henry’s backstory specifically, and his connection to the Mind Flayer. So those are the two areas that I think are the most revelatory or impactful as we move into the final episode.\n\nSadie Sink and Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler Courtesy of Netflix\n\nHow useful can Max be, having spent a year and a half in Vecna’s mind?\n\n\n\nRoss Duffer: Pretty useful, because she knows she knows his memories, and that is where Eleven is going — she’s going into his mind, or into “Camazotz,” in order to fight him. So I think if Max hadn’t spent all that time there and hadn’t learned her way around, it would make this final battle nearly impossible.\n\nThe last time we talked, you still had work to do, and you weren’t there yet in terms of feeling like this experience was coming to an end. Where are you now?\n\nRoss Duffer: Well, we don’t have work to do anymore!\n\nMatt Duffer: It’s a weird feeling. We finished last week — or it was yanked away from us last week. I mean, we would be working on it for another year if we could.\n\nIt feels very odd. But on the other hand, we’ve been working on it for three years, and it felt right — the right time to let it go. And we’re just excited for people to finally see it.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 1 spoilers\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:31:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T04:38:57.592336"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.\n\nJamie Campbell Bower‘s Vecna only gets more terrifying in Volume 2 of the final season, which sees the monster get another step closer to enacting his plan to merge the human world with another dimension.\n\nAs viewers learn over the course of the three episodes, the Upside Down is a wormhole that has connected Hawkins to this alternate dimension that Dustin dubs “The Abyss,” which they believe is the true home of the mind flayer, the demogorgons, and the rest of the evils that have been haunting them for the past four years — even, it seems, Henry Creel.\n\nThe characters have been completely unable to locate Vecna all season, because, as it turns out, he’s been hiding in this alternate dimension that they were unaware of and can’t access (since it is situated thousands of yards above them). While they’re unraveling this mystery, Vecna is busy trying to keep Holly (Nell Fisher) and Max (Sadie Sink) from escaping his mind prison. The girls realize that, in order to get out, they’ll need to trek their way through Henry’s memories instead of their own, leading to a heartbreaking moment where they witness a very young Henry murder a man he encounters…in a cave. This seems to give insights on why Henry won’t enter the cave that Max and Holly have been hiding in within his mind, though there are still some questions left to be answered in the finale.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWhile Max manages to get out, Holly isn’t so lucky. By the end of the penultimate episode, she’s back in his clutches and Henry begins his process to merge the worlds, teasing one final face off to come in the 2-hour finale.\n\n“[Episode] 8 comes in steaming hot, right off the back of 7. It’s go time. It’s really, really explosive,” Campbell Bower tells Deadline.\n\nIn the interview below, the actor unpacks his descent further into the madness of Henry Creel for Volume 2 of the fifth and final season of Stranger Things.\n\nL-R: Noah Schnapp as Will Byers and Jamie Campbell Bower as Vecna in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: Was any of this information we’ve learned about Henry since Season 4 pitched to you when you took the role? How much did you initially know?\n\nJAMIE CAMPBELL BOWER: I don’t think any of it was pitched to me when I joined. I do remember towards the end of filming the Henry portion of Season 4, Matt and Ross, sort of, we had a little aside conversation, and they were like, ‘This has been amazing. We were always going to bring you back as Vecna, but now we feel like we should bring you back more as you.’ and I was just like, ‘Cool. Sounds great. Whatever you guys want.’ So, with regards to the story arc, none of it was pitched to me, and I think it was, from what I’ve heard and read from Matt and Ross, it was something that sort of developed in the in-between time.\n\nDEADLINE: I do really enjoy that we get to see more of Henry this season. And I’m curious how it was for you working with some of these younger kids, especially having to be so cruel to them? What did you gain from that experience? Because they’re giving you so much back emotionally. And I wonder, for you as such a as a more seasoned, older actor, how that was to kind of get to play in that sandbox with them.\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: It was awesome. I mean, there were definitely times where it was terrifying for me. I’ve been vocal about this today and when we were discussing the first chapters as well. The Mr. Whatsit side of things, this is a presentation, and the intention is buried. So when you’re sat opposite a child, burying the intention, children, naturally, can see through the BS and lies. It’s a very terrifying experience at times to be sat there…but it was also a lot of fun too, because the kids were so great. There was so many funny moments where we’d be playing games between takes, and particularly that last scene in Episode 7, where we’re all sat round the table, it was one of the first times where, I mean, you know, obviously, aside from the beginning of five, we were all together, and we had a lovely day. It was just a beautiful, fun experience to play with them. They’re so great and so receptive, and it was a joy to be able to get to know them and work with them. All of them are amazing. I love Jake dearly. I just think he’s the loveliest boy, and I got to know his family too, and he’s just a great kid. I’m so glad that the fan base and the world has taken Derek into their hearts. It was always the thing that I hoped most for him. I was like, ‘He’s so cool. I hope that that happens,’ and it has, and I’m so happy for him.\n\nDEADLINE: You’ve talked about Henry and especially Vecna’s head being a hard place to live in as an actor, and I’m curious how this was for you to get to unpack some of what happened to him as he was a kid? I’m thinking particularly about the scene where we get to see Henry as a young boy kill that scientist in the cave, and that’s a really jarring scene.\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: It is something that I thought about going into Season 4, even, and had qualified between 4 and 5 when I went to go and see the play. So, getting to play those scenes out, I felt at times like a huge release, and it was also really important for me to go into those scenes understanding the trauma and the experience to bring that level of humanity forward. I’ve been describing Henry this season, and the way I approached it as, like, memory retention, but buried far away. So when I get to uncover that, dig that up, it does humanize the experience and the character for me, because there are times where I feel wildly inhuman, monstrous, and I know that sounds obvious, but like truly monstrous. So I took great pleasure in those moments for sure.\n\nDEADLINE: There’s a scene in Episode [5] that I really like where we see in real time Henry kind of transitioned from One to Vecna. How did you think about the subtle differences in the evolution of that character throughout those periods of time to be able to pull off something like that?\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: I mean, I think it was always that thing of, like, the mask failing, it falling away, and where I got to with Henry at the end of Episode 7 of Season 4 was the way in which I wanted to be bringing him back when we saw him again. It was in that emotional space. Having lived in Mr. Whatsit already in Season 5, there is a difference for me between them, subtle though it may be, there is a difference. So yes, there are emotional differences and difficulties, but also physical [ones]. That particular moment, the physicality of that was something that we worked on with, actually, with somebody who works in the video game space, and using things like called nodes, which are like particular moments that you strike and that you’ll come back to. So the shift between Whatsit and Henry was something that we worked on off set prior to shooting it.\n\nI was going through my videos the other day, and I’m there on the stage doing it, trying out different things, trying out how I wanted my head to move and where my arms were going to be. Yes, that is a very short moment, but it is something that we spent a long time on, just to make sure that it was right and that it felt cool. So much of that is about intuition and the work that goes into it beforehand, so that when you get into the space, it’s just like, ‘Oh, this is what naturally these characters would do here.’ It was really fun. It was really cool to do the sort of more shape-shifty bits. In England, we have three exams in your years between, like, 13 and 18, and the middle one is called your AS (Advanced Subsidiary) Levels, and I did dance AS Levels. I got to lean quite heavily into that dance side of my childhood, which was really fun. It was nice to know that that was still in there, and, God, like it hasn’t completely gone.\n\nJamie Campbell Bower as Henry Creel in ‘Stranger Things’ Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: How you view, emotionally, that separation between Henry and Vecna? Is it just a loss of humanity? How do you make that distinction in your head when you’re playing those characters?\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: I mean, it depends on what we’re referring to as a loss of humanity, really. Because, is it the distance from the heart, or is it like monstrous in the sense of monsters? I think Henry was so close, was much closer to innocence, was much closer to the experiences, and then when he was sent to that slippery, veiny demise at the end of [Season] 4, it became about resentment, and at that point, it felt like humanity had gone. It felt like the possibility of love was so far away. I refer to love as that thing that keeps us alive, and so I think Henry, if we look at it this way, like Henry is close to innocence, Whatsit is further removed, and Vecna is just like…it’s impossible — virtually impossible — for there to be anything that feels like love.\n\nDEADLINE: What are you excited for from the finale, and what you ultimately hope people take away from this character that you’ve spent so much time thinking about and playing?\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: So with regards to what we can expect for the finale, I am genuinely, really excited for Episode 8 to come out. I feel like Episode 7 is — because I obviously know what’s coming in 8, and we do leave on quite, in my opinion, knowing what’s coming, quite a hefty cliffhanger, and 8 comes in steaming hot, right off the back of 7. It’s go time. It’s really, really explosive. I’m really excited for people to see that, because I know how it felt to work on it, too, and that’s really cool. What do I hope people take away from this character? Wow, I’m still in process on that. Like, I’m genuinely still in process on that, because I spent so much time in it, and I don’t know if I can yet see the wood from the trees. I’m not sure. So much of this character is based on the idea of loneliness. So much of this character is based on the idea of salvation. I had to fall in love, and I did fall in love with Henry Creel. I had to want to protect him. I had to want to nurture him and love him, because that’s my duty as the person that’s playing him. I have to understand him, and I don’t know how it feels to be a viewer, yet, watching that from afar, I don’t know. I’d have to give myself another six months to truly be able to absorb that.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T04:38:58.106394"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.\n\nWill Byers (Noah Schnapp) takes a big leap of faith in the penultimate episode of Stranger Things 5.\n\nAfter escaping Vecna’s mind invasion, Will realizes that he’ll continue to be vulnerable to the monster unless he comes clean about a secret he’s been keeping. So, rather than continue to let Vecna pray on his guilt and shame, he takes control of his own destiny. In a moving scene in Episode 7, “The Bridge,” Will comes out as gay in front of all of his friends and family.\n\n“It was so freeing. I mean, there’s been so much build up for this scene for so long. Since, I would argue, episode one of the first season,” Schnapp tells Deadline. “So getting to finally have that moment and just have that dialogue… Will is always speaking through so much of his facial expressions, but to actually verbalize his emotions and express them to everyone was so freeing to finally get to do.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWhile this is the first time that Will has said out loud that he doesn’t like girls, creators Matt and Ross Duffer seemed to be dropping hints regarding his sexuality in earlier seasons. Throughout Season 5, it became much more obvious when Will found out about Robin’s (Maya Hawke) relationship with Vickie (Amybeth McNulty) and began peppering his friend with questions about how she came to terms with her own sexuality.\n\nBut, it isn’t until he’s tortured again by Vecna that he realizes the only way forward is to open up about this part of his identity. In part, Schnapp says, Will refrained from doing so sooner because, even though he’d come to accept his sexuality, he was still grappling with his feelings for his best friend, Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard).\n\nBy the time he comes clean, Schnapp thinks he’s made peace with the fact that Mike is likely not going to reciprocate those feelings — a realization he says felt quite relatable.\n\n“He accepts his own identity by the first volume, and that’s what allows him to unleash these powers,” Schnapp explains. “But then, like he says, it takes him through kind of Volume 2 to really understand that it was never about [Mike], it’s about himself. I mean, I think it was just really well done and really authentic to how the story unfolds. I know I could definitely relate to some of those feelings of being in love with a best friend who’s not in love with you. It feels [like a] realistic representation of being queer and growing up.”\n\nNoah Schnapp as Will Byers and Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler in ‘Stranger Things: Season 5’ Courtesy of Netflix\n\nSchnapp has been very vocal about his thoughts on Will’s sexuality, though it was never explicitly confirmed by series creators Matt and Ross Duffer before now, which has only fueled online discussion as fans began to suspect that it might play a pivotal role in his Season 5 arc. As he pointed out, the series has been alluding to this moment since Season 1, when Will’s friends used to tease him about not liking girls.\n\nNow, creators Matt and Ross Duffer admit the scene is “something we’ve been building to for a long time,” as the latter tells Deadline.\n\n“I think mostly we were nervous, as we just wanted to do right by Noah. Obviously, we’ve been working with him for so long, since he was a little kid, and we knew that this scene, obviously, we’ve talked about it over the years with him,” Ross continued. “We knew it was important, and we all wanted to get it right. There’s not a scene, I don’t think, in the entire series that we spent as long on as we did that coming out scene, just working it and working it until it felt right to us.”\n\nHow did they know when they got it right? Getting the seal of approval from the actor who has been playing the character for a decade and arguably knows him better than anyone.\n\n“The litmus test was giving it to Noah, but then seeing how he responded to it and reacted to it gave us confidence,” Ross added.\n\nSchnapp says that, in some ways, Will’s coming out felt parallel to his own, allowing him to draw from his own experience to access his character’s emotions for that moment and “make it feel so real.” Still, there were some cultural and political differences in the 40-year span between the two boys’ revelations that the actor wanted to ensure were taken seriously as well.\n\n“[It was about] making sure I really understood the environment and the landscape that I’m declaring this in, where the AIDS epidemic was rampant, the Reagan administration wouldn’t even acknowledge that gay was a real word. If you even so much as came out, people thought you were sick and were contagious,” he said.\n\nWill has a genuine concern that he “could be abandoned and lose everything,” Schnapp says, “so just having the stakes in my head that I really wanted to make sure I got right.”\n\n“I just, of course, wanted it to feel as authentic as possible. It’s such an important scene, because it’s going to affect so many real young Wills out there struggling with their own identity, and I wanted it to be perfect for them and do justice to this character, which has been leading up to this for so long. So, yeah, just making it feel as authentic and natural as possible,” he continued.\n\n(L to R) Noah Schnapp as Will Byers, Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler, and Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers Netflix\n\nDuring the scene, Will breaks down as he confesses that Vecna had tried to convince him that his loved ones wouldn’t stand by him if they knew the truth. While he was trapped in Vecna’s mindscape, he says the monster showed him a false reality where he lost several of them to this admission. It wasn’t that they outright rejected him, but according to Vecna’s vision of the future, many began to slowly distance themselves from him once he revealed his full self. He says he hopes that, by telling them the truth, he can prove to himself — and to Vecna — that won’t happen.\n\nWhile trepidatious at first, once Will begins his monologue, the words just start pouring out of him, almost uncontrollably.\n\n“He had [the scene] months in advance, and he just worked it and worked it,” Ross Duffer recalls. “I remember him telling us…he wanted to not even have to think about the words on the day, because it would just allow him to sort of access this part of himself where he’s not thinking about the language of it all, he’s just letting the emotion come through. That’s exactly what we did, and we’re so proud of him [and] what he accomplished on that thing.”\n\nTo his relief, Will is met with unwavering support from everyone in the room. And, when it came time to film the scene, so, too, was Schnapp. To capture both Schnapp’s performance and the reactions of the rest of the cast took an entire 12-hour production day, after which Matt Duffer says the actor “looked like he was about to collapse.”\n\nEven when the camera was firmly on Schnapp, the rest of the cast made sure to be there for every single take. Likewise, Schnapp repeated the lengthy speech several times with the same fervor when the cameras were focused on coverage of everyone else.\n\n“He poured everything into every single take,” Matt said. “I think that brought out these incredible performances in [the cast], and I think they got lost in what he was saying, and it was moving them in a very real way, because Noah was very, very, very emotional that day, and very moving.”\n\nAs a result, says Shawn Levy, who directed the episode with the Duffers, “the thing that makes that scene even more beautiful and memorable is the reactions of the other characters and actors.”\n\nThroughout Will’s speech, the camera cuts repeatedly to Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Robin, who are both beaming with pride at his extraordinary display of vulnerability, and the rest of the teenager’s closest confidantes — all of whom are giving them their undivided attention as he pours his heart out to them.\n\nUsually, “it’s always so loud and chaotic on set, especially when the whole cast is there. There is no silence. Everyone’s messing around. Everyone’s making jokes,” Schnapp says. But, on that day, “you could hear a pin drop.”\n\nStranger Things 5\n\n“They were so respectful and gave me so much space to get into the character, which I really appreciated. I didn’t really get to fully take note of all their reactions, just because there’s so many people in the room, and I’m so emotional,” he continued. “So it really only hit me after, when I watched it, seeing how genuine it felt. And then, of course, when we cut the cameras, Charlie and I started hugging and crying for real. So it definitely hit home.”\n\nWill’s coming out is a big milestone not only in his personal life but also, presumably, in the fight against Vecna. As for how things will pan out in that department, Schnapp is staying quiet for now.\n\n“I guess you’re gonna have to wait and see,” he teased. “I’m excited to to share it with the world.”\n\nThe finale of Stranger Things arrives on December 31.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T04:38:58.435499"}

The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art graduate, who gained recognition [&#8230;]", "content": "Rukmini Vasanth is having a moment. Fresh off Rishab Shetty‘s blockbuster “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” the Indian actor has Yash‘s “Toxic” and a Prashanth Neel film with NTR Jr. on deck, and her approach is clear: women with agency who make decisive choices.\n\nThe Royal Academy of Dramatic Art graduate, who gained recognition for her nuanced work in the critically acclaimed “Sapta Sagaradaache Ello” films (2023) opposite Rakshit Shetty, tells Variety that her performance as Kanakavathi in Rishab Shetty’s mythological prequel was carefully architected from the start.\n\nSet centuries before the events of the 2022 sleeper hit, “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” follows the conflict over sacred forest land, with Vasanth’s character harboring secret ambitions that ultimately drive the narrative. The pivotal nature of her role was established from her first meeting with Shetty and his writing team of Anirudh Mahesh and Shanil Guru, with the character’s carefully concealed motivations and dramatic reveal integral to the film’s structure from the beginning.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“When Sir [Rishab Shetty] called me in for my first narration with him, and he told me upfront that this is all going to hinge on this girl’s sudden twist and the deep-held desire of hers to take over this land that she doesn’t reveal until the last moment,” Vasanth says. “That was very much planned, and that was something that I walked into fully aware of from the first meeting.”\n\nThe actor acknowledges the responsibility was daunting, particularly given the massive success of the first “Kantara” film. However, the prequel’s distinct historical setting and visual identity helped establish different audience expectations.\n\n“From all the material that the film’s team had released, audiences were kind of prepared for the fact that this is a very different world that we’re going into,” she explains. “It’s not the same 1990s Kundapura that we had seen in the previous film. This is a very different world, and I think that leveling of the ground helped me because I didn’t feel as if people were expecting to see a certain kind of character.”\n\nBringing her London drama school training to bear, Vasanth discusses the challenge of calibrating performance style to match the scale of “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” while maintaining emotional authenticity – a marked departure from her breakthrough work in Hemanth M. Rao’s “Sapta Sagaradaache Ello” films, which she describes as prizing silence and spaces within dialogue and interaction.\n\n“One of the beautiful things that I’ve been able to learn over my career is which style and where it belongs,” she says. “In the world of ‘Kantara: Chapter 1,’ some of the more restrained stuff can look too subtle to register because the scale is so large that you need to be able to match that scale.”\n\nVasanth uses a vivid analogy to explain her approach to calibrating performance. “You kind of need to regulate what is needed of you,” she says. “It’s like speaking – in a quiet living room, you can afford to whisper, but if you’re in the tube, you need to shout a little bit.”\n\nRukmini Vasanth – “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” Hombale Films\n\nThe actor credits her disciplined approach to her background, with a father in the military and a mother who is a dancer. However, she emphasizes that her time at drama school was where she truly internalized the necessity of preparation and consistency.\n\n“The discipline and preparation gives you the ability to show up regardless of what the outside variables may be,” Vasanth says. “You can’t really be too precious about the kinds of environments that you require in order to put out a good performance for a film that deserves that.”\n\nShe describes the challenging production conditions on “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” with constant rain and limited shooting windows. “You’d have the crew members carrying these giant rigs up and down a hill. So at that point you can’t really be like, it doesn’t feel right to me. You just have to get on with it and do it as well as you possibly can.”\n\nLooking at her filmography, Vasanth has gravitated toward characters who are emotionally decisive, even when constrained by circumstances. She attributes this pattern to what makes for compelling storytelling.\n\n“Characters that make decisions, that may not be the right ones necessarily or the wrong ones, but that make decisions of some kind, and then that pulls the story along – I think I know what to do in those moments,” she says. “It’s just women with some sort of agency doing things.”\n\nVasanth’s upcoming projects include “The Elder One” director Geethu Mohandas’ highly anticipated “Toxic” opposite “K.G.F” star Yash, and a film with “Salaar” and “K.G.F” filmmaker Prashanth Neel featuring “RRR” lead NTR Jr.\n\nOf “Toxic,” she says that it has challenged her in unprecedented ways. “It’s unlike anything that I’ve taken on before, which has equal doses of nerves to see how it unfolds,” she says. “The working style has been really, really fascinating and very different from anything I’ve encountered. The way that Yash Sir and Geethu approach this film, the scripts, the way that we’ve gone about shooting has been an incomparable experience for me.”\n\nAs for working with Neel and NTR Jr., she praises their continued enthusiasm for the craft. “It’s always very lovely when you work with people who come with such a strong body of work, but are very unencumbered by whatever that may have brought. You still see the sense of play and the sense of enjoyment.”\n\nOn the topic of pan-India casting, Vasanth suggests the label is more relevant to the commercial side of cinema than the creative. She points to historical precedents, including actor-director V. Ravichandran’s multi-industry production “Shanti Kranti” (1991).\n\n“I think pan-India films have been happening. They’ve been attempted for a really long time,” she says. “Those are just labels and actors have been working across multiple industries all the time. We’re all very lucky that it’s successful and lucrative also now.”\n\nVasanth is now working across multiple South Indian film industries, with upcoming projects in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu cinema, representing a new generation of actors operating fluidly across linguistic markets.

For the first time in their more-than-a-decade-long history, they would use their uninterrupted alone time to tell each other the truth about how they feel. No more burying their emotions or expressing them in a language the other can’t understand –– no matter how beautiful Ilya’s Russian revelation was in Episode 5.\n\nIt didn’t take long for them to make good on that promise. Ilya teased Shane about maybe marrying his best friend, Svetlana (Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova), or another woman so as not to blow their cover. But then he admitted he had a problem –– none of those women were Shane. Shane, in turn, pulled an all-nighter churning out a plan for them to slowly ease the world into the idea of their relationship, starting with Ilya joining the Ottawa team to be closer to him in Montreal, and then they would co-found a charity to start melting the supposedly frigid animosity between them. It was a long-game plan, but the mere mental gymnastics of trying to set up their future together moved Ilya to tears, and left him coughing up those three words–– “I love you.” Shane immediately reciprocated it with lightning-fast urgency, obliterating one of the last barriers between them.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHudson Williams, Connor Storrie, Dylan Walsh and Christina Chang Courtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\nFrom there, the tenor of their cottage getaway changed, and ultimately felt more romantic than ever. That is, until Shane’s dad, David (Dylan Walsh), walked in on them kissing and fled before his son could explain. Shane had put off telling his parents about being gay or loving his archrival. But now, Shane and Ilya both went to see David and Yuna (Christina Chang) to break the news. It was a tough pill to swallow, but not because they don’t approve of their son. Rather, it completely shatters his hockey-loving parents’ 10-year-plus belief they hated each other. Instead, they finally see two young men, who have been crazy about each other since rookie year (or rather, the summer before!), now sitting at the Hollanders’ dinner table as a couple. Ilya even comforts Shane in a moment of panic by calling him his boyfriend, a simple but monumental step for Hollanov, as the internet has dubbed them.\n\nSeason 1 ends as the boys drive back to their refuge away from the world, staring down a beautiful sunset that hides everything that waits on the other side of their cottage chapter, which will play out in an already-ordered Season 2. That’s a little different from the conclusion of Rachel Reid’s book, on which the series is based, in which they launch their foundation to lay the groundwork for the future. However, series creator/writer/director Jacob Tierney wanted something more romantic for his final shot, just in case the series didn’t become the phenomenon that it has.\n\n“I wanted to leave the viewer with what the book left me with emotionally, which was the warm, fuzzy feeling of them getting to be happy together,” Tierney tells Variety. “I thought of doing something with just a bit of elegance, and there’s a simplicity to the two of them in a car, driving off into the sunset, and not over a cliff. That was all I ever wanted out of this story.”\n\nBelow, Tierney tells Variety about how he pulled the much-anticipated cottage episode together; whether fan-favorite couple Scott (François Arnaud) and Kip (Robbie GK) will play a bigger role in Season 2 — and why he thinks women have gravitated toward this unabashedly queer love story between two men.\n\nThere are some things that happen at the cottage in Rachel Reid’s book that aren’t here in the finale. Shane and Illya playing against each other in Shane’s hockey training facility, and a pretty explosive oral sex scene that could have been an homage to the beginning of “Queer As Folk.” How did you figure out what would make the cut for your version for this chapter for Shane and Ilya?\n\nI wanted to make sure we were still on the same journey with them, and still learning things about them. If we are talking specifically about the sex scenes in the book, they’d eaten ass in Episode 2, so I didn’t really feel like I needed to hit that hard here. I wanted to make sure that we were still watching this change and evolve for them, and the sex that we were seeing this time around was more intimate, playful and sweet. And as evolved as it could be, particularly from the stuff that we were seeing in Episodes 1 and 2. Ultimately, the stuff that mattered to me at the cottage was the stuff that continued the journey of understanding them and their relationship. There was no set agenda. It ended up being the stuff I remember from reading it, if I’m being honest.\n\n5 Courtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\nBy the end of the episode, they have learned to better communicate with each other. Not perfectly, but previously sex was their only means of doing that. Does that mean you envision less sex in Season 2, and more sitting on the couch scrolling their phones and touching toes now that they can use their words more efficiently?\n\nOh, the touching toes! I love that scene. You know, Rachel talks a lot about the promise that I made to her to take her characters seriously. She takes them very seriously in “The Long Game,” and that doesn’t mean there’s no sex. There’s quite a bit of sex in “The Long Game.” But I think it functions differently in the second book, and that’s just what I want to do. The journey of this show, no matter how long it goes on for, will always be centered around the relationship between Shane and Ilya. Sex will always be a big part of it, like it is with any romantic relationship. But it’s really about continuing that progress of what happens after that first blush of love, what happens after you decide you’re in love and how do you sustain it? That’s a very adult question: “We love each other, and now what? Does that mean everything’s easy?” No, it does not. There’s loads of challenges that get thrown Shane and Ilya’s way. Beyond what’s in the books, I really don’t have an agenda besides that I love this couple and I love these characters, and I want to just hang out with them more and watch them grow more and watch them become better for each other.\n\nSince you loved the touching toes scene, was that something you planned ahead of time or was it a choice you and Hudson and Connor made in the moment while filming?\n\nNo, that was planned. What I really wanted to be part of the cottage episode was that, when you’re in a relationship, you’re just doing things like being on your phones at the same time. I want them to live in the real world, and to do those little things that people do when they are in a relationship, because Shane and Ilya are. They can’t always be fucking. God knows, that’s just exhausting! I just wanted to capture little normal couple moments and I don’t think I’m the only one in a relationship who occasionally sits on a couch scrolling on our phones separately and then showing our partner what we are seeing.\n\nIt certainly shows how far they have come since their fleeting hotel meetups. But there is still a little bit of Reid’s book that you don’t cover in the finale. In the book, months later they announce Shane’s big plan to start a foundation together, the first step in chipping away at their rivalry until they can come out as a couple. But your season ends with them riding home from Shane’s parents’ house in the car, just holding hands and laughing. Do you see Season 2 starting with that announcement, or was this your end to the first book?\n\nWell, books are so different from TV and I didn’t know if I was even going to get to make more of these. As much as I care about their charity and what they’re going to do, I don’t know that we need a bunch of exposition at the end of a season of TV like this. I wanted to leave the viewer with what the book left me with emotionally, which was the kind of warm, fuzzy feeling of them getting to be happy together. I thought of doing something with just a bit of elegance, and there’s a simplicity to the two of them in a car, driving off into the sunset, and not over a cliff. That was all I ever wanted out of this story.\n\nPart of the balancing act of the storytelling for me was always that you get this big moment with Scott and Kip in the last episode. It is this massive rom-com public declaration of love, and what I love about Shane and Ilya’s story is that you get another version of that kind of happiness, which is this small moment with the two of them just being allowed to be in love. That was the sweetest ending I could come up with for them, for now.\n\nSpeaking of Scott and Kip, there has been such an enthusiasm for them, maybe more than some people expected. Last week’s episode, which ended on Scott bringing Kip out on the ice to announce their relationship, now shares the top spot on IMDb’s list of the highest-rated episodes of television of all time. Does that encourage you to include more of their story in Season 2, or do you foresee keeping this format of seeing them when they intersect with Shane and Ilya?\n\nThis will continue to be Shane and Ilya’s story, and Scott and Kip will continue to intersect with them on occasion. But just because “Heated Rivalry” is Shane and Ilya’s story doesn’t mean that precludes potentially doing stuff with Scott and Kip outside of that specific show. We optioned all Rachel’s books, and part of the reason we did that was because, obviously, these characters appear throughout all the books. There’s a real richness to a lot of the stories there, and fans will know that Scott and Kip feature very strongly in “Common Goal.” They are all over the place. I don’t know exactly what we’re going to do yet, but there are places we could go with them that I would definitely be excited to explore.\n\nCourtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\nIn the finale, we get a scene with Shane and his mom, Yuna, after he comes out. This is a bit of a change from the book, where the conversation is entirely between Shane, Ilya, Yuna and David. Why did you give Shane and his mom this separate moment?\n\nYuna is such a crucial character in the story. I know it’s not always on display in this season, but as fans of the books know, Yuna is such a big part of both Shane and Ilya’s lives moving forward. In trying to take this stuff seriously, I wanted to show complicated, interesting adult relationships here, and that includes the parents. It was just really important to me for Shane and Yuna to have a conversation. They needed to have a moment together. They’re obviously very close. They’re obviously very similar, and his mom has very similar blinders that he does. So there’s something really important about reminding people that even though we can hurt each other in these relationships, and they can be difficult, there is love and allyship there as well. Sometimes, it just requires a little conversation.\n\nThe queer community is understandably hooked by this show, but there has also been an intense embrace from female viewers, specifically straight women. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think that’s a very complicated question, and there are a lot of answers to it. Women love these books. These are books written by a woman. These are books largely consumed by women. So I wouldn’t want to speak on behalf of a female audience, but I think that what women are presented in romance is not always something that interests them in that way. I think that women are also, in real life and in culture, endlessly exposed to sexual violence. Seeing things like this, that are depictions ultimately of male vulnerability, can be very refreshing. From what I’ve heard, from the women who have written to me and Rachel and the boys, there’s a safety in seeing a woman being removed from the conversation. So you’re watching something happen between two men, and there is no fear of violence. There is no fear of things turning into stuff that women have to deal with too much in real life, and don’t want to deal with in their fantasies, and ultimately, this is a romantic fantasy. I think it’s also that maybe romance — which is a genre that women love and write and read and are the primary consumers of — just doesn’t get treated with a lot of respect. Nor do the people that make it, or those that adapt it either. So I think that they are responding to, at least I hope, the fact that we came to it pretty fullhearted, and as fans and as people who want to honor this material and want to honor the genre and make it as romantic as we can. That’s certainly what I wanted to do.\n\nEvery week, despite the soaring success of your show, you have had to respond to controversies and people wanting to tear it down. This week, Hudson responded to Deuxmoi’s comments about his personal life, and who he might be dating. But Deuxmoi also said the show has no plot and bad acting. What do you say to opinions like that?\n\nThis show wouldn’t work if any of that were true. I mean, it just wouldn’t. Nobody would give a shit about this if the acting was bad, or if there was no story. I think this is a show that actually requires you to pay attention. If you’re glib and you’re on your phone the whole time, or you’re looking to not pay attention, then God bless, and do whatever you want. But you have to be there in the moment if you want to watch. This is a show where there’s a lot of communication between the lines. It’s a lot about behavior. It’s a lot about watching. And if you don’t have the attention span for it or the interest, then I’m gonna be super honest with you. I could give a fuck what Deuxmoi’s criticism is of the show. I literally don’t even know who these people are. I don’t give a fuck what they think about anything. But I understand that, from what I have read multiple times now, people say this is a show that is not a co-viewing experience. You can’t be on your phone. If you wanna get what it’s doing, you have to pay attention to it. It’s definitely made to hold your attention. And if it doesn’t, then that’s a good criticism too. This is not for everybody, and that is A-OK. But I think at a certain point, the show speaks for itself, and the reaction to it speaks for itself, and there’s no way that these boys would be on the receiving end of the attention that they’re getting if they weren’t good. The papa bear in me does not like comments like this, obviously, because I know how hard they work. I think they’re fucking amazing. But we also live in a time where everybody gets their opinion, then they get to put it out on whatever platform they have, and so I get it. Keep doing your thing, Deuxmoi!\n\nLooking ahead to Season 2, you’ve spoken about how you haven’t started writing yet, but is there anything specific you are most looking forward to adapting from “The Long Game?”\n\nThere’s so many new characters that are going to be really fun to bring in. But I think that next season will end up feeling different because it’s a more focused book. It takes place over a shorter amount of time. There’s more a sense of getting to know that team in Ottawa that Ilya is going to play for and getting to know Hayden and Jackie more. And there’s more Yuna and David. Hopefully what will happen, like with any good second season in general, is that we will get to enrich the stuff you already know and how those threads began, and then pull on them and really get into it. But I’m also really looking forward to seeing Ilya in therapy. It’s probably a really good thing for him. I know that my therapist has been crucial to getting through the past few months.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 06:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T06:40:26.106149"}

His own father derisively called him queer, as his mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) recounts early in Season 1. And while he shared his friends’ affinity for playing Dungeons & Dragons, biking around town and geeking out on the latest pop-culture, fantasy or scientific phenomenon of the show’s 1980s setting, Will disappeared during the very first episode, setting the wide-eyed, bowl-cutted boy apart from the group.\n\nDespite his friends rescuing him from the Upside Down at the end of the first season, Will only grew more distinctive as the series continued. As his friends came of age and found girlfriends, he remained outside the group, not only from his traumatic abduction, but from a more elusive feeling of isolation. In Season 3, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) snaps at Will for not liking girls, which further sparked fan speculation regarding the character’s sexuality.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThose speculations seemed to be confirmed, though never explicitly stated, in Season 4 when Will breaks down trying to profess his feelings toward Mike. However, it’s not until Season 5, Episode 7, “The Bridge,” when Will finally admits to his friends— “I don’t like girls.”\n\nThe emotional monologue rounding out the series’ penultimate episode is a powerful, touching and poignant delivery on Will’s highly anticipated coming out. It pays off on Will’s arc toward self-acceptance and assurance. While the character has spent much of the series as the victim, he takes center stage as a hero in Season 5, revealed to have sorcerer-like supernatural abilities in the season’s fourth episode that concluded Volume 1.\n\nThese triumphant moments also demonstrate Schapp’s growth as an actor over his 10 years playing Will. The coming out monologue is Schnapp’s most emotionally intense and verbose in the series. The performance is further accented by Schapp’s real-world relationship to the topic, having publicly come out as gay in 2023.\n\nVariety spoke with Schnapp to unpack the distinguished scene, how he shaped it with series creators Matt and Ross Duffer and director Shawn Levy and his feelings about closing the book on his decade-plus role in “Stranger Things.”\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nAt what point did you find out that Will was going to come out in Season 5, Episode 7?\n\nYou know that it’s coming. This season, we read the first six episodes together, and I was like “OK, it didn’t happen yet, so it’s going to be in Episode 7 or 8,” which hadn’t been written yet. So then from January of filming on through the year, I kept texting the Duffers, “Is it done? Did you write it? Is it in 7 or 8? How are you gonna write it?” Eventually, they said they had it, and I read it by the end of the year in August or September. And I was just in tears. It was perfect.\n\nDid you get the opportunity to workshop the script with the Duffers or with Shawn Levy, who directed “The Bridge” with the Duffers?\n\nI was worried that I might need to, but honestly, it was perfect. I really had no notes about it.\n\nDo you recall your co-stars’ reactions the first time that you rehearsed the scene, or did a table read? Shawn Levy told us that the reactions on camera were genuine.\n\nHonestly, I was so wrapped up in my emotions and what I was feeling that I kind of blocked out everyone around me. I kind of had to because it was so nerve-racking to know that the entire cast was there watching me. I had Winona next to me, and the boys and Maya [Hawke] around me. It was all a blur. I don’t really remember anyone’s reactions, but watching it back, it was nice to see. It did feel genuine.\n\nHow many takes did you do of the scene?\n\nOh my God, it was endless. It was like a 12-hour day of just that monologue. And we weren’t even done after the 12-hour day. We came back a week later to reshoot certain parts of the scene for another 12 hours. It was like, “Oh my God, how many more times can I do this scene?” But it was also nice because it allowed me to try so many different things. I never felt stuck to anything. I got advice from Maya on how to prepare for it, because there were so many lines, more lines than I’d ever had before.\n\n\n\nMaya speaks like a madman so I asked, “How do you learn all these lines and not think about it in the scene?” She said, “It’s not about how well you know it, it’s how long you’ve known it for, so just prep for months before.” So I’d just go through it morning and night every day for months before shooting, but I wouldn’t prep how to say it or how to feel. It would just be plain saying the lines out loud with no emotion, just to sink it in. But then on the day, I was able to explore the feelings and emotions, and it was fun to have those 12 hours to play and feel. The cast was so gracious. I’ll never forget how supportive they were on that day and how respectful and giving they were to me, because they had to sit there through an entire night just hearing me ramble. They were supporting me on all these angles where they weren’t even caught on camera. They could have gone and sat in Video Village or hung out, but they all sat there in their spots through the whole day. It was really special.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nIn those 12 hours of takes, did you film versions of the scene that are different from what ended up in the final cut?\n\nThere were so many different choices in the different takes. I remember being asked, “Do you want to do your close up first or do you want to do it at the end of the day?” Because that was the most important shot. So I could either start with a wide and kind of explore it and feel out the scene and then go to the close up, or go straight into it. I was really struggling with whether I was ready to bang it out first or get comfortable before it. I decided last minute, “Let’s just start with the close up. I’m ready to go and I just want to do it.” And then it was like one of the first takes of the day, and that was most of the meat of the scene. It was so nice because it hadn’t been exhausted yet. It was real and raw and I’m glad I did it that way.\n\nWas there anything that surprised you in the final cut of the scene and the way it was edited?\n\nLiterally for every scene, I’m like “Oh I didn’t expect that.” You don’t realize the power of editing and how it can change a scene. For this scene, it was nice because there were moments where I tried the first paragraph of the monologue to the boys where it was a lot more sad, and then there were times when I was a lot more happy reliving the memories with them. I’m glad that they edited it the way they did, where it’s nice to see him not just sob through the whole scene, but kind of smile through the memories and give that lighter feel. It makes it hit harder.\n\nIt’s interesting that Will says “I don’t like girls” rather than “I’m gay.” How was that wording decided on? Was there fear about being too explicit, or do you think Will is still sort of figuring out his identity?\n\nYeah, I noticed that and I spoke to the Duffers about it specifically. We have to remember that its the 1980s. When I came out, I didn’t say the word “gay.” It’s hard, and it feels scary to say it. In the ’80s, I can’t imagine how much more pressure there was and how much more there was to lose. When Will is first coming to terms with it in front of his friends, he’s probably scared to use that word, but there’s nothing wrong with it. I think he just felt more comfortable phrasing it that way.\n\nDo you think discovering that he’s a sorcerer has given Will the confidence to embrace what makes him different? How has discovering Will’s newfound power changed your approach to the character?\n\nI think it helps him accept himself, and you totally see it from the beginning of the season. He’s kind of more assertive and self-assured. It’s nice to play that side of him, and not just play someone who’s always walked all over. Even with the coming out scene, having that much dialogue and actually getting to express myself through my words, which this character has never really done until then, was so nice.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nA lot of those scenes you share with Winona Ryder. What was it like working so closely with her this final season after having played her son for almost a decade?\n\nIt was really special. I was kind of sad in Seasons 3 and 4 that I got separated from her, and I really missed working with her. She’s one of my favorite scene partners and people, and it was so nice to be with her for most of this season. I feel so comfortable around her, and it was hard to say goodbye. I didn’t expect to have such trouble letting go of her on that last day. I didn’t want to let her go, and I realized she really became this motherly figure to me at work during these 10 years.\n\nYou also share a lot of scenes with Maya Hawke this Season. How was collaborating with her?\n\nWe definitely got closer. I’d barely spoken to Maya before then. I mean, I don’t even think we were friends. Now, we spent the whole season together, and she’s part of my little “Stranger Things” family.\n\nLastly, you had the ability to collaborate with younger actors this season. For so long, you and the main ensemble were the youngest people on the show. What was it like to now have new rising actors on set who might have looked up to you?\n\nIt definitely helped me realize, “Wow, we’ve come so far. We’re not kids anymore.” They’re looking to us. You always feel like you don’t know anything and you have so much more to learn, but then it makes you realize that we’ve spent 10 years here, and we do have some experience now. It was nice to get to work with them and they were so cute. They just brought this childlike energy that reminded us that we were still kids too. I was making handshakes with them and I felt like I was 12 years old again. It was so fun.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 2 spoilers\n\n• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 1 spoilers\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 05:55:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T06:40:26.768023"}

Ahead of the highly anticipated Season 1 finale &#8216;The Cottage&#8217;, which is [&#8230;]", "content": "SPOILERS: This post contains details about the Heated Rivalry, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nWith the conclusion of Heated Rivalry‘s rookie season, writer/director/creator Jacob Tierney is taking a breath before hitting the ice again with the wildly popular LGBTQ hockey drama series.\n\nAhead of the highly anticipated Season 1 finale ‘The Cottage’, which is now available to stream on Crave and HBO Max, Tierney teased that despite the satisfying closure of the episode, Season 2 and beyond “will always be centered around” Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov’s (Connor Storrie) love story, with author Rachel Reid’s final book in the series, The Long Game, serving as the basis.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“But we have a whole universe here, and so there’s loads of other things that we’re thinking about and that we’re gonna explore and that we’re gonna start to take more seriously now that we know that there’s an audience for it,” explained Tierney, following the show’s Season 2 renewal. “And that’s pretty exciting, so I’m looking forward to really digging into this world.”\n\nTaking LGBTQ and female audiences by storm with its bold depictions of gay sex and romance, Tierney revealed that his favorite intimate scenes were in the finale.\n\n“What I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it’s one thing to just make smut—which I’m thrilled to be doing. No shame in that game,” he said. “But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. Who cares at a certain point? We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers.”\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nTierney added, “That’s why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it’s both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. And I like those two juxtapositions. That’s when I feel like they’re a real couple, like when you’re giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. That’s what a boyfriend does.”\n\nRead on about the Heated Rivalry, Season 1 finale’s sex scenes, why the show’s depiction of LGBTQ fame appealed to him and what’s ahead for Season 2.\n\nDEADLINE: Are you surprised that the show has taken off on this level, outside of Canada?\n\nJACOB TIERNEY: No, this is exactly what I expected—yes, I’m very surprised. We’re all a bit overwhelmed by the reaction to the show. Obviously, it’s very gratifying and it’s very nice, but it’s certainly not anything you can expect, and then coupled with, plan for anything like that. It’s crazy.\n\nDEADLINE: And it was awesome seeing the fan reaction to the Scott [François Arnaud] and Kip [Robbie GK] kiss in the last episode. It was such a good wrap-up for that episode.\n\nTIERNEY: It was very moving to see all those reactions. It was very, very moving for me.\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’ (Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max)\n\nDEADLINE: And now, all of the gays and the girls are super excited for ‘The Cottage’.\n\nTIERNEY: I’m telling you, no Canadian’s that excited.\n\nDEADLINE: Was the pressure on to bring that part of the book to life? Because I’ve seen a lot of people are really anticipating it.\n\nTIERNEY: I mean, I made the show. I didn’t think anybody was gonna care this much. I’m relieved that I made it the way that I did. I mean, there was pressure for me internally to end the show well. And I think that the thing that I was aware of, though it might not seem that way on the surface, it’s a big swing cause it’s a two-hander essentially. To go from an episode like 5, which is so big and epic, into ‘The Cottage’, which is relatively tiny—I think 38 of the 52 minutes are the two of them alone in a cottage. That’s kind of a big structural and narrative swing to pull off, or to attempt, I suppose. But I just wanted to continue to do right by this relationship, these characters, and to give their journey the kind of last push that I thought it needed to successfully finish the book.\n\nDEADLINE: And I really appreciated the scene with Shane’s parents because coming out was obviously such a big fear for him, and just seeing how perfectly they handled it. Tell me about bringing something that gay kids really need to see to the screen like that.\n\nTIERNEY: Yeah, it’s a big part of the book, so I certainly didn’t invent it whole cloth. But yeah, that stuff is very important, and it’s always been an interesting distinction between Shane and Ilya. And I think it’s quite stark when Ilya—it’s a small line that he says in episode 5, but he says that about his father, “I wish he could have known me.” And I think that’s what he means, and I think that Ilya’s very aware. Part of the reason that he’s kind of gently probing Shane in that episode and being like, “Do they know about you?” And he’s like, “No, about you. Who f*cking cares about me? Do they know you? If they don’t, you’ll regret it at a certain point. You need to take this leap.” And it’s scary as those of us who’ve come out to parents [know], which is most gay kids at this point, or queer people in general. It’s very scary and it’s a big deal, but it’s something that’s pretty important in that journey. And what was important to me throughout the show was to make sure that we had sophisticated and complicated relationships with parents going on here. It was why it was so important for me to keep Skip’s dad in the show, to see somebody be supportive like that, to see somebody whose love cup is endless. And I think that to see Yuna [Shane’s mom, played by Christina Chang] is such an important part of this show, and she’s such an important part moving forward, especially. And I think that in these moments, you see that her and Shane are so similar, and they have very similar limitations, and that it was really important to me for the two of them to have a moment together beyond what was already in the book and what was already in the story. It felt very important to me that these two have—I don’t think it’s a reckoning, but that they have their own moment of intimacy where they can clear things up for one another. Because I think they’re both the kinds of people that build things up in their heads, and when you say things out loud, I think you can kind of take the air out of them, and it suddenly becomes a lot more manageable than whatever you’ve created in your brain. And it helps to have two very, very good actors there to do the heavy lifting for me.\n\nChristina Chang as Yuna and Dylan Walsh as David Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’ Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’ (Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max)\n\nDEADLINE: And one thing that’s really tragic, even though it was such a great finale, just the fact that Shane wants to just keep their relationship a secret until they retire. And it kind of struck me how it’s almost like art imitating life, or vice-versa, with the pressure and speculation that the actors are facing. Was that exploration of fame in the back of your head when you were making this?\n\nTIERNEY: I mean, I’ve been an actor my whole life. I know what that’s like. I’ve known loads of actors in the closet. I’ve known loads of actors who have come out. And I do think that part of the reason that this story appealed to me is because I can relate to it. I can understand that pressure, especially when you come up at a young enough age that you don’t know, that you don’t know what an answer to a question like that would be, but you certainly live in a world where you got a lot of people telling you not to talk about it, and that if you want the things you want, you’ll kind of keep toe-ing a line. And I think that’s also part of what makes the story resonate with so many people is that we’re not pretending we live in a world without homophobia, and we’re not pretending we live in a world where coming out is easy. I think that’s part of the beauty of what Scott does is so brave, and it’s so big, and it does crack something open for other people, but I think what it cracks open for them is just allowing them to know that they are allowed to be together. The rest of it, they can figure out at a later date—and the fans of the book know how this is gonna go—but I think that part of what is interesting and different and unique about Shane and Ilya’s story is that this journey that we’re watching them go on in this first book, in this first season of TV now, is a journey to just understanding that they love each other. And that’s such a hurdle for them. That’s hard enough for them, that to then add in the rest of the world, I think will take a whole other season of television. So, that’s kind of part of the journey that will be explored down the road. But I have a lot of empathy and I have a lot of time for Shane’s journey with that stuff. It’s not easy. It’s hard, and I do think that there’s actors, a lot of professionals, especially people who begin their professional journey at 12 years old. There’s so much baked in, and there’s so much built in around you that you can often lose yourself. I think it’s quite easy to do that, and again, I’ve seen it happen with so many actors that I came up with.\n\nDEADLINE: Speaking of which, I just recently discovered that you were in Are You Afraid of the Dark?, which was such a big part of my childhood.\n\nTIERNEY: I am a campfire kid forever.\n\nDEADLINE: I love that. Were there moments on Heated Rivalry where you had to compromise your vision or the story?\n\nTIERNEY: Sure, there were moments along the way … my execs at Crave were so f*cking amazing about that. There were people along the way. But my execs, they didn’t want it toned down at all.\n\nHudson Williams as Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nDEADLINE: Well, it’s great to see such a fearlessly queer show, especially when GLAAD recently released their study that almost half of LGBTQ characters are disappearing. So, it just feels very needed right now, and I love it.\n\nTIERNEY: We added a bunch, so at least there’s that. It’s not a great time for stuff like that, and I think, unfortunately, the more there’s consolidation among broadcasters and streamers too, it’s not gonna get a lot better, I don’t think. But it is nice to be a part of a show that is doing something like this, that’s reminding people that there’s loads of audiences here and that they can be queer and queer adjacent, our allies, our friends, our families. If this was just gay people watching this show, we wouldn’t be talking about it right now, let’s be real. So, the fact that it’s gotten to this level of conversation in the culture is because there are people that want to watch this, and they don’t care if it’s two men in a love story, or maybe even want that specifically. And then even more so, it’s just such a pleasure to be involved in a show that’s making people happy and that is providing joy. I still read people being like, “I know that this show is gonna end on a cliffhanger.” And I keep wanting to shout it from the rooftops, “It won’t! I don’t want to do that to you, that’s not what we’re doing here.”\n\nDEADLINE: Honestly, I had that thought too, watching it. It’s such a good ending, and then they get in the car. I’m like, “Oh, they’re about to get into a car accident or something. I just know it.”\n\nTIERNEY: You know what’s really funny, is that if I let that footage just run and run and run, because we shot that in the studio, my producing partner Brendan [Brady] will run out in front of that car and get hit by it. So you will see our straight producer dying. Does that help? Is that the secret twist that nobody saw coming?\n\nDEADLINE: That’s the one we want.\n\nTIERNEY: There you go. That’s it.\n\nDEADLINE: Another thing I thought was funny, I’m reading a lot of the social media reactions, and you’ve introduced a lot of viewers to frottage.\n\nTIERNEY: Frottage at the cottage, baby!\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nDEADLINE: Yeah, exactly. So that’s cool, it’s really opening a lot of eyes to queer sex. And I’ve also seen some people talk about how very accurate the sex scenes are to the book, and I’m wondering if you were very committed to maintaining accuracy to those scenes.\n\nTIERNEY: Some of them are super accurate to, or close to the book, and some of them go different ways. But what I would say I was committed to, that Rachel and I are both committed to, was kind of using this sex to tell their story, that this is not separate from their story. The sex isn’t like, “And then they fuck! Let’s put it in a new room or do it on a kitchen counter.” Their sex is the way that they understand each other, and it’s the way that we understand them as a couple. So, what I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it’s one thing to just make smut—which I’m thrilled to be doing. No shame in that game. But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. Who cares at a certain point? We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers. You can go watch sex wherever you want to. So, what would have to keep this interesting, is to watch it evolve and to watch their intimacy change. That’s why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it’s both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. And I like those two juxtapositions. That’s when I feel like they’re a real couple, like when you’re giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. That’s what a boyfriend does. That’s annoying. That’s great. That’s what I want to see.\n\nDEADLINE: Another thing I loved, as great as the sex scenes are, I noticed that episode 5, there’s not as many sex scene.\n\nTIERNEY: There’s none.\n\nDEADLINE: But there’s a lot of more emotional intimacy, and it made it feel so earned and real. Like when Ilya tells Shane “I love you” in Russian.\n\nTIERNEY: I think that’s part of the evolution too, it’s a story. It was really important to me that you have to earn these moments. That’s why episode 3 is where it is, and that’s why 5 ends the way it does. This stuff, it has to imprint on you, and then, you get that those big feelings like that. And I don’t think you get those big feelings that you get in 5 if you haven’t sat through how painful 4 was for them, or the ending of 2, where you’re like, “Oh God, will these two ever f*cking learn to talk to each other?” And then when they do in 5, it’s in two different languages. I think that’s also part of what’s amazing when romance works, that you’re just endlessly watching two people bypass each other. When they hit, you’re like, “No, wait! It’s not that.” And that aching. Yeah, it’s been so fun to see people react to that.\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nDEADLINE: Where are you at with Season 2, or are you just kind of letting it ruminate?\n\nTIERNEY: It’s all gonna be underwater. It takes place in the lost city of Atlantis—no, listen, Season 2 will be based around The Long Game. I don’t have details. I have not started writing, so I’m not just trying to be evasive. I genuinely don’t know yet. I’m so lucky to have a whole world of books here to grab things from, to use, to add color, to add context, to add story. I can tell you I’m really excited to get back to writing. I’m excited to get back into this world with them, and I’m looking forward to it. I guess, here’s what I can say too, is that Heated Rivalry will always be centered around Shane and Ilya, this show. But we have a whole universe here, and so there’s loads of other things that we’re thinking about and that we’re gonna explore and that we’re gonna start to take more seriously now that we know that there’s an audience for it. And that’s pretty exciting, so I’m looking forward to really digging into this world.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 06:01:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T06:40:27.655201"}

The organization’s new name, after what the White House claimed was a unanimous vote by the board of trustees, is “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Experts say the renaming of the Kennedy Center is illegal.\n\nBut the Kennedy Center is not the current owner of trumpkennedycenter.org or trumpkennedycenter.com — because back in August, comedy writer Toby Morton registered those two domain names, expecting Trump and his allies to add Trump’s name to the D.C. landmark.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“As soon as Trump began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year, I thought, ‘Yep, that name’s going on the building,’” Morton recently told the Washington Post. “The Kennedy Center has always been a cultural institution meant to outlast any one administration or personality. It’s meant to honor culture, not ego. Once it was treated like personal branding, satire became unavoidable.”\n\nSnapping up domain names and using them to troll politicians has been an active pursuit for Morton, who has “South Park” and “Mad TV” writing credits (and once provided the voice of Scott Tenorman, the half-brother and nemesis of Eric Cartman, on “South Park”). Morton, whose bio on BlueSky says he is a “Creator of Anti-Fascist websites,” hasn’t launched websites on trumpkennedycenter.org or trumpkennedycenter.com at this point. But he pledged that when he does, they will “absolutely reflect the absurdity of the moment. Lots of surprises. Some things are truly hard to parody, though.”\n\nVariety has reached out to the Kennedy Center’s press office for comment.\n\nMorton, in a post on BlueSky this week, marveled at supportive comments from readers responding to the Post story. “I’m so used to hate comments that these from the Washington Post article feel downright refreshing. Also, a few longtime heroes of mine are quietly on board now, which helps. PRO TIP: Maybe don’t mess with an institution like The Kennedy Center? The support is growing. Watch this space.”\n\nPer the Washington Post, Morton operates about 50 political parody sites. Those mtg2026.org, which lampoons Rep.

This actress, still resplendent, emerges onstage and receives a round of applause, a bit of homage from an audience that knew her years before, and is waiting to see what she can do now — how time has changed her. To this point, we’ve seen her deny her ambitions, as well as her lust for the film’s title character: She’s too composed to give herself away. Now, though, the audience cannot see her face as she turns her back on them, but the camera follows her and so we can. She has burst into the gladdest grin, remembering, all at once, what the attention of the crowd felt like.\n\nThe performer is Kay Stone, a fictional mid-century star who’s receded into private life. And the performer playing her is Gwyneth Paltrow, whose very public life has, for years now, not made room for acting. To see Paltrow at work is to be reminded of what a vital and urgent screen presence she is, how alive she manages to be in every moment and how adept she is at showing the way her characters hide that vividity behind shades of cool. It’s also to be aware that perhaps Paltrow needed the time away to conjure a performance quite this majestic.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPaltrow made no secret of her ambivalence about acting after becoming a mother; her business interests, in the form of her Goop suite of media entities and products (kicked off with a newsletter in 2008), have allowed her to more proactively define her brand, and what roles she’s held on to have plainly not been that exciting anyhow. (She practically seems to delight in going viral when, in various on-camera interviews, she can’t remember appearing in various Marvel films.) Many actresses, past 40, find opportunities drying up. As if to pre-empt the question, Paltrow stepped away from the set and found opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThat choice compels us in other ways. Many people who are not inherently interested in wellness culture, or in self-help jargon, or in a woo-woo redefinition of the concept of “divorce” as “conscious uncoupling,” got on board the Goop train, at least as gawkers. I reserve judgment on whether the ideas Goop puts forward are valid. They’re interesting to the onlooker because the figure speaking about them has that Paltrovian assurance and composure.\n\nBut while Paltrow has been making her way in the world of business, something’s been missing on-screen. The passionate anger thrumming under Margot Tenenbaum’s seen-it-all glare in “The Royal Tenenbaums”; the lust for life Viola de Lesseps must tamp down under boy drag in “Shakespeare in Love”; the slowly dawning repulsion Marge Sher- wood struggles to hide in “The Talented Mr. Ripley”: Those weren’t flukes. They were proof of Paltrow’s particular interest in playing with the concept of concealment, of showing us just how hot her blood can run under the hauteur. The defining pre-Goop image of Paltrow in the public imagination is of her facade breaking while accepting an Oscar. Done up in princessy Ralph Lauren, she openly, loudly wept: The passion underlying the pink couture is what she’s shown us in movies too.\n\nThat’s also at work in “Marty Supreme,” and perhaps it’s no wonder the script appealed to Paltrow. By contrast to the frosty but secretly yearning Kay Stone, Timothée Chalamet’s Marty Mauser is all bravado, pushing his career as a table-tennis player forward through his insistence that he is destined for the pantheon. (Marty, too, makes for a metatextual meal for the actor playing him — Chalamet is as un-shy about his ambition for himself as any star currently working.)\n\nTheir pairing is one of opposites: Marty seems, for much of the film, resistant to the idea of an inner life. Life, for him, is meant to be lived aloud. Kay, though, has been seasoned enough by the Hollywood system and life’s disappointments to know just how much of herself to keep in reserve. And so when Paltrow lets loose and shows us the flare of uncontrollable emotion undergirding Kay’s careful control, we who have missed this talent of hers are powerless to do anything but mirror the audience on-screen, and let out a cheer.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T15:27:33.332177"}

Welcome to 2025 at the multiplexes!\n\nIt was a roller-coaster year at cinemas and for the studios tasked with keeping their screens filled. Warner Bros. enjoyed an epic run at the box office, fielding hits as diverse as a vampire flick set in the Jim Crow South (“Sinners”), an old-school star-driven racing drama (“F1: The Movie”) and a sandbox-game-turned-big-screen-smash (“A Minecraft Movie”). Meanwhile Paramount, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars on yet another “Mission: Impossible,” barely released anything that turned a profit.\n\nAnd then there’s Disney, which backed three movies that topped $1 billion (we’re assuming that will be the case with “Avatar: Fire and Ash”) and stands out as the only studio to cross a combined $6 billion globally, but also distributed nearly twice as many big-budget duds (“Elio,” “Snow White” and “Tron: Ares,” to name a few). More troubling, Marvel, once Hollywood’s biggest hitmaker, struggled to regain its mojo. It’s all coming down to next year’s “Avengers: Doomsday” to get the franchise back on course.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOur annual report card includes the five major studios as well as A24, which is nominally an indie, but spent lavishly on “The Smashing Machine” and “Marty Supreme.” But it doesn’t include streamers such as Amazon and Apple, which didn’t release enough movies in cinemas for us to judge their slate. Come on, guys, start spending those Bezos bucks!\n\nAs 2025 draws to a close, it’s time for Hollywood to get its report card. Some of you may not want to hang it on your fridge.\n\nDisney\n\nHighs: “Lilo & Stitch” ($1.03 billion against a $100 million budget), “Zootopia 2” ($1.31 billion against a $150 million budget), “Freakier Friday” ($153 million against a $42 million budget), “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($506 million and counting against a $250 million+ budget)\n\nLows: “Captain America: Brave New World” ($415 million against a $180 million budget), “Snow White” ($205 million against a $250 million budget), “Elio” ($154 million against a $150 million budget) “Tron: Ares” ($142 million against a $180 million budget), “Predator: Badlands” ($181 million against a $105 million budget), “Ella McCay” ($4 million against a $35 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: Disney deserves props for fielding two (and likely three after “Avatar: Fire and Ash” gets through the holiday season) billion-dollar hits, a feat that illuminates the chasm between the studio and its rivals, none of whom had a single film cross $1 billion since 2023. Yet almost nothing else worked for Disney beyond the live-action “Lilo & Stitch” remake, “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar 3.” Marvel continued its lousy streak, producing three consecutive commercial duds in “Captain America: Brave New World,” “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” (Next year’s Sony-produced “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and “Avengers: Doomsday” can’t arrive soon enough.) “Elio” underscored Pixar‘s continued struggle to launch original animation. Meanwhile, “Snow White,” “Tron: Ares” and “Predator: Badlands” proved that some aging properties are better left in the vault. That’s a problem for Disney, which relies almost entirely on recycling what’s worked in the past. Let it be a mantra for Hollywood: Brand recognition doesn’t equal box office dollars.\n\nGrade: B\n\nParamount\n\nHighs: “Smurfs” ($124 million against a $58 million budget), “The Naked Gun” ($102 million against a $42 million budget), “Regretting You” ($90.4 million against a $30 million budget)\n\nLows: “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” ($598 million against a $400 million budget), “Roofman” ($33 million against a $20 million budget), “The Running Man” ($68 million against a $105 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: In its defense, Paramount spent most of the past year stuck in a painful limbo as it waited for government regulators to approve its sale to Skydance. That left studio executives — many of whom correctly deduced they’d be shown the exit as soon as David Ellison’s crew took over — punching the clock. Paramount did write a blank check to Tom Cruise, only to find that he had embarked on one impossible mission too many. It also gambled that Edgar Wright and Glen Powell could crack “The Running Man,” the second adaptation of the Stephen King novel; the first attempt flopped when it hit theaters with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sadly, the pair shouldn’t have bothered lacing up their sneakers. Paramount fielded a few cost-effective hits, like “Smurfs” and “The Naked Gun,” but these are not the kind of modest successes one expects from one of Hollywood’s most storied studios. Will the new management fare better?\n\nGrade: C\n\nSony\n\nHighs: “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” ($664 million against a $20 million budget), “Chainsaw Man” ($153 million), “One of Them Days” ($51 million against a $14 million budget), “Karate Kid: Legend” ($117 million against a 45 million budget), “28 Years Later” ($151 million against a $60 million budget), “I Know What You Did Last Summer” ($64.8 million against an $18 million budget), “Materialists” ($71 million at the international box office)\n\nLows: “Caught Stealing” ($32 million against a $40 million budget), “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” ($20 million against a $45 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: Sony didn’t have any home runs, but it also avoided any strikeouts. It wasn’t a terribly strong year for the studio, to be sure. But we’re grading based on what’s been released and not what could have been. Anime was a massive boon, with Crunchyroll’s “Demon Slayer” and “Chainsaw Man” scoring back-to-back wins while demonstrating a voracious appetite for manga adaptations in the U.S. The studio also kept the theatrical comedy alive with the Keke Palmer and SZA-led “One of Them Days,” and turned A24’s romantic drama “Materialists” into an international hit. Neither “Karate Kid: Legend” nor “I Know What You Did Last Summer” were necessary sequels, but both films scraped together modest grosses. As for “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” the collective wattage of Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell couldn’t overcompensate for terrible reviews and bad buzz. Star power only gets audiences to theaters if the movie is, ya know, good.\n\nGrade: B\n\nUniversal\n\nHighs: “How to Train Your Dragon” ($636 million against a $150 million budget), “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($868 million against a $180 million budget), “Black Phone 2” ($132 million against a $30 million budget), “Wicked: For Good” ($488 million and counting against a $150 million budget), “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” ($206 million against a $36 million budget)\n\nLows: “Wolf Man” ($34 million against a $25 million budget), “Love Hurts” ($17 million against a $18 million budget), “M3GAN 2.0” ($39 million against a $25 million budget), “Him” ($28 million against a $27 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: Sequels and reboots delivered in a big way for Donna Langley and her team. On paper, rebooting “Jurassic World” a mere three years after the last installment in the “when dinosaurs attack” franchise might have seemed like a bad idea. But it turns out people really like watching velociraptors dine out on some pesky humans, especially when Scarlett Johansson is trying to avoid becoming dessert. The studio also scored with follow-ups to “Wicked” and “Five Nights at Freddy’s” that won’t do anywhere near the same business as their predecessors but should turn a tidy profit. There were flops, of course. But failures like “Wolf Man” and “M3GAN 2.0” didn’t cost much to produce. The main issue that Universal faced is that Blumhouse, which made both those films, was uncharacteristically inconsistent. “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” and “Black Phone 2” helped the company get back on track, but it needs to deliver new franchises instead of just servicing old ones.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nHighs: “A Minecraft Movie” ($958 million against a $150 million budget), “Sinners” ($367 million against a $90 million budget), “Final Destination Bloodlines” ($315 million against a $50 million budget), “F1: The Movie” ($631 million against a $250 million+ budget fronted by Apple), “Superman” ($616 million against a $224 million budget), “Weapons” ($268 million a $38 million budget)\n\nLows: “Mickey 17” ($133 million against a $118 million budget), “The Alto Knights” ($10 million against a $50 million budget), “One Battle After Another” ($204 million against a $140 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: It’s the comeback of the year. After a rough end to 2024 (“Joker: Folie à Deux,” anyone?) and a rocky start to 2025 (“Mickey 17” and “The Alto Knights” were pricey bombs), the studio rebounded the old-fashioned way — by banking on bold directors and new ideas at a time when reboots and sequels reign supreme. Seven consecutive releases, from video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie” and Ryan Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners” to the Brad Pitt-led sports drama “F1: The Movie” and Zach Cregger’s genre-bending mystery “Weapons,” opened above $40 million domestically, a first in Hollywood history. Although Paul Thomas Anderson’s comedic adventure “One Battle After Another” isn’t in danger of turning a profit against its hefty $140 million budget, the film surpassed the $200 million mark and achieved a milestone by getting adult audiences to theaters for original fare. Plus, “One Battle” could be valuable beyond the balance sheet as a major Oscar contender. This might be Warner Bros.’ last year as a stand-alone studio. If that’s the case, it went out with a bang.\n\nGrade: A\n\nA24\n\nHighs: “Materialists ($104 million against an $18 million budget), “Bring Her Back” ($39 million against a $10 million budget), “Friendship” ($16.5 million after being acquired for $3 million), “Eternity” ($28 million against a $12 million budget)\n\nLows: “The Smashing Machine” ($21 million against a $50 million budget), “Eddington” ($13 million against a $25 million budget), “The Legend of Ochi” ($4.9 million against a $10 million budget), “Warfare” ($33 million against a $20 million budget), “Death of a Unicorn” ($15 million against a $15 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: The indie studio is trying to play with the big boys by moving beyond its low-budget roots. But it found out the hard way that spending more money doesn’t always result in bigger profits. Benny Safdie’s “The Smashing Machine,” featuring a change-of-pace performance by Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson as a troubled MMA fighter, was too dark for the actor’s fans and failed to earn the critical acclaim it needed to pack in art-house audiences. Oh, and it cost $50 million to produce and millions more to market, making it one of the year’s bigger bombs. The same was true of Ari Aster’s “Eddington,” a political satire set during COVID that discovered that most moviegoers would rather memory-hole the pandemic. A24 did score with “Materialists,” a starry rom-com from Celine Song that became a true mainstream hit. And it has a chance to end things on a high note with “Marty Supreme,” a table-tennis drama starring one-man hype machine Timothée Chalamet. If it scores, A24 deserves some extra credit.\n\nGrade: B-", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T15:45:52.625245"}

But for now, we’ve got a lot of questions.\n\nDuring the Christmas Day release of Volume 2 of “Stranger Things 5,” many key plot points were fleshed, and we received a lot of information heading into the series finale, dropping on Dec. 31. We learned things we never knew — like, that Eleven’s powers come from Henry’s blood, as transfused by Dr. Brenner, and that the Upside Down isn’t its own dimension, but instead is a wormhole connecting our world and Vecna’s, which Dustin has named the Abyss.\n\nAs we process “Shock Jock,” “Escape from Camazotz” and “The Bridge,” the latest “Stranger Things” episodes, we’ve rounded up the biggest burning questions ahead of the finale.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBIG QUESTION: What is the ultimate importance of Nov. 6?\n\nIt’s the night Will Byers went missing in the series premiere in 2016, and it’s the night Vecna wants to enact his plan to use the children he’s kidnapped to bring the Abyss and Earth together — but why on this date? What was the significance in the first place that led Vecna to take Will?\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nAND, why does Vecna want to bring the Abyss and Earth together?\n\nIs he just a nihilist who wants to burn it all down at this point? Or is something else going on?\n\n\n\nSOMETHING WE’D LOVE TO KNOW: How did Hopper, El and Kali get out of the Upside Down?\n\n\n\nThe Upside Down was in chaos, falling apart at the seams, and Nancy, Jonathan, Steve and Dustin were still stuck down there — but Hopper, El and Kali managed to get out off-screen. By the start of Episode 7, Hopper and the girls are back in Hawkins, but we don’t see how they managed to get out amid the chaos after Nancy shot a hole in the exotic matter barrier. What did they do to get back out?\n\nWHILE WE’RE AT IT: What blocked the Demogorgon from getting into the elevator to get Max and Lucas?\n\nThat Demo was coming right at them and when it jumped, something prevented it from getting through. And Karen Wheeler could only do so much in a day to save the kids, so what else was going on there?\n\nBIG QUESTION: What stopped the white goo from spreading in the Upside Down?\n\nNancy and Jonathan were saved from certain death in the Upside Down when the world stopped melting into white goo around them, and hardened enough that they could walk on it. While this happened just in time to keep the two alive — but not their relationship — it’s not clear what caused it all to stop and stabilize, as the Upside Down is still seemingly compromised after Nancy shot through the barrier.\n\nSOMETHING WE’D LOVE TO KNOW: Also, what happened to the ring?\n\nNo, it’s not that important, but it was flung on the floor and ultimately, it was what showed them that everything had hardened so… did someone pick it up?\n\nBIG QUESTION: Who is the man young Henry finds with the briefcase down in that mine shaft in the Nevada desert?\n\nFans who have seen the Broadway play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” will have a leg up on what is going on here, but it’s still largely a mystery. We know Henry had a traumatic experience in the desert as a child, after which he was never the same. “First Shadow” reveals Henry entered an alternate dimension, known as Dimension X, and returned after 12 hours with altered blood, a changed personality and psychokinetic powers. Who is the stranger Henry came across, what was he holding onto — and what exactly happened to Henry to make him into this darker person?\n\nBIG QUESTION: What is the connection between Dimension X, the Abyss and the Upside Down?\n\nWe now know the Upside Down is a wormhole that connects Earth to this other world Vecna inhabits, the Abyss. Vecna was banished to the Abyss at Hawkins Lab by El back when he was Henry/One. Despite their shared mistreatment from Brenner, El refused to join Henry in his plans for world domination and ripped a hole in reality that pushed him through to the Abyss. And Brenner, the other scientists and the military put up the exotic-matter barrier that stabilizes the Upside Down and separates the wormhole that goes between the Abyss and Earth from nothingness. And are the Abyss and Dimension X the same thing?\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nBIG QUESTION: Will Eleven sacrifice herself?\n\nAt the end of Episode 7, Kali told El that, for everyone’s benefit, they should kill themselves after defeating Vecna. It’s a sacrifice, Kali says, the two need to make so that the military cannot use their blood to try to create new kids like them, ending the cycle that began when Brenner gave Henry’s blood to pregnant women to create El, Kali and the other telekinetic kids at Hawkins Lab. But will El actually go through with that?\n\nBIG QUESTION: Will any main characters die in the finale?\n\nIn Episode 5, El got very angry with Hopper for having revealed that he would have tried to fight Vecna alone, and for wearing the suicide vest as a failsafe. But now she’s hiding her own secrets — from Hopper, and from everyone — about Kali’s plan. If Eleven does somehow make it out alive, doesn’t someone have to die, even if Matt Duffer told Variety that the show “is not Game of Thrones'”? (And will it be Hopper, in some incredibly noble way?)\n\nALSO: Is Will going to reveal his feelings to Mike?\n\nWill came out in Episode 7, and was embraced by support and love from his friends and family members. And he seems to accept himself for who he is, and, on Robin’s advice, not to rely on reciprocated feelings from someone to feel validated. But does that mean Will won’t have a more direct conversation with Mike about his crush before the end of the series? And if he does, how will Mike react to it? (Also, not that Mike understood this slight, but was it kind of mean for him to refer to Mike as his Tammy?)\n\nBIG QUESTION: How much will Max be able to get inside Henry’s head?\n\nAfter Max died and was brought back to life in the Season 4 finale, her physical body was in a Hawkins hospital — but her mind was in the Abyss with Henry, in Vecna’s mindspace. As Max makes it clear to Holly, she’s spent the past 18 months exploring that terrain as she successfully hid from him. She knows he’s afraid of the cave, and that he has vulnerabilities. As they gear up for their final battle with Vecna, Max tells Eleven to call upon her so they can use that knowledge against him.\n\nAND FINALLY: Will Nancy and Steve end up together?\n\nLet’s end with some silliness. Now that Nancy and Jonathan have called it quits, does this pave the way for Steve to get his dream of having a bunch of little nuggets with his ex?

The images are what Snyder showed to Warner Bros. executives when he was trying to cast Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman in his new DC Universe, which was kicking off with 2013’s “Man of Steel.”\n\n“Henry Cavill. The original Superman suit. This photo. It was undeniable,” Snyder wrote in one caption, while adding in another: “With the last image I shared, and this one, we showed WB [and] everyone agreed: Henry Cavill was Superman. That’s where the journey began.”\n\nCavill played Superman across three movies in Snyder’s DC Universe: “Man of Steel,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Justice League.” Then things got complicated. After a five-year hiatus that left fans wondering about Cavill’s Superman future, he popped up as the Man of Steel in the post-credits scene of 2022’s “Black Adam.” Cavill’s reappearance coincided with reports that a standalone Superman sequel for him was finally in development with the studio soliciting pitches from writers. The post-credits scene teased the DC Universe would then be heading towards a battle between Cavill’s Superman and Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I am back as Superman,” Cavill wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “Thank you for your support and thank you for your patience. I promise it will be rewarded.”\n\nTwo days later, Cavill spoke publicly for the first time about his Superman return during a live recording of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast at 92NY in New York City and said: “There is such a bright future ahead for the character. I’m so excited to tell a story with an enormously joyful Superman.”\n\nCavill’s return was not long for this world, however. Just a day after the announcement, news broke that James Gunn and Peter Safran were taking over DC Studios and launching a new DC Universe. This would effectively end Snyder’s DC Universe, in which Cavill had been front and center. Gunn said on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast earlier this year that an “unfair” situation was created when his deal to take over DC Studios closed just as Cavill was announcing his return. Gunn had planned on rebooting Superman from the start, which he successfully did this summer with his David Corenswet-starring “Superman.”\n\n“The day our [DC] deal closed, all of a sudden, they were announcing that Henry was back,” Gunn said. “And I’m like, ‘What is going on?’ We know what the plan is. The plan was to come in and do ‘Superman.’ So it was really unfair to him and a total bummer… “That was really unfortunate. So Peter and I [thought] the right thing to do was to sit down with [Cavill] and talk to him. And we sat down and we talked to him. He was an absolute gentleman, a great guy about it. He said, ‘The only thing I ask is that I’m able to reveal it myself as opposed to it coming from you guys.’”\n\nThrough all of the presumable drama, Gunn and Snyder stayed in touch. Gunn revealed on X shortly after taking over DC Studios that he had touched base with Snyder and there were no hard feelings between them. Gunn told Fandango earlier this yea that he even consulted with Snyder when it came to designing the new Superman suit and whether or not to add the red trunks.\n\n“One of the biggest questions was, ‘Were we gonna have trunks, or were we gonna not have trunks?’” Gunn said. “I talked to Zack Snyder, who was like, ‘I tried a billion different versions with the trunks, and at the end of the day, I tried it, but I just couldn’t get there.’ And I was feeling exactly the same way. … Theoretically, I liked the idea of trunks because it’s the Superman I grew up with.”\n\nGunn’s DC Universe continues in summer 2026 with “Supergirl” and then the “Superman” sequel film “Man of Tomorrow.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:23:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:25:02.868607"}

In comparison, “Avatar: The Way of Water” made $29 million on Christmas Day in 2022, though the holiday fell on a Sunday, and $90 million over its four-day frame. Even though it’s behind Cameron’s previous film, the sci-fi threequel “Fire and Ash” should have a strong hold through the end of the year to offset its large budget.

Full of shocking twists and turns and gruesome violence, which are par for the course with all of Coben’s works, the show is an entertaining maze from its opening scene until the close. “Run Away” reminds audiences that one secret is typically just the tip of the iceberg; as you begin to dig into it, more mysteries often reveal themselves.\n\n​\n\nSet in the U.K., “Run Away” follows financier Simon Greene (James Nesbitt), whose life appears picturesque on the surface. He’s happily married to his pediatrician wife, Ingrid (Minnie Driver), and he has three lovely children, Paige (Ellie de Lange), Sam (Adrian Greensmith) and Anya (Ellie Henry). Unfortunately, the Greene household is in disarray. Sam and Anya are thriving at university and high school, respectively, but Paige has gone missing. After a troubling start in college and becomin g dependent on drugs, she has now disappeared completely. While Ingrid insists on letting their eldest child hit rock bottom, Simon is driven to bring her home.\n\n​\n\nWith his tenacity and a wealth of financial resources, Simon discovers Paige’s whereabouts after six months of no contact. Unfortunately, the father/daughter reunion turns sour quickly, as Simon violently pummels Paige’s volatile boyfriend, Aaron Corval (Thomas Flynn), in front of a park full of spectators. When Aaron is found slaughtered a short time later, Simon becomes the prime suspect for Detectives Isaac Fagbenle (Alfred Enoch) and Ruby Todd (Amy Gledhill). Desperate to clear his name and find Paige again, Simon joins forces with private investigator Elena Ravenscroft (Ruth Jones), who connects Paige to a separate missing person’s case she has been hired to work on.\n\n​\n\nFans of Coben’s frequent adaptations, including Netflix’s “Fool Me Once,” “Missing You,” and “The Stranger,” know his series are tapestries of riddles, and “Run Away” is no different. The mystery around Paige’s disappearance stands at the center of this story, yet it is only one component of the tale. Shocking revelations, horrifying cruelty and complex lies engulf the narrative itself, even when it leans toward the preposterous. Still, the stellar cast, taut pacing and inventive storylines keep the show engaging, even when it could’ve very well fallen apart.\n\n​\n\nFrom the Greene family to Elena’s personal life and the biases of Inspector Fagbenle, there is a wealth of information embedded in the series. However, what’s most compelling, as is the theme in many of Coben’s works, is how little we really know about our loved ones. As human beings, we all have secrets, things we’ve tried to forget or instances we’re ashamed of. These are fragments of our beings we are scared to confess, for they could alter how others perceive us or how we see ourselves. “Run Away” does an exquisite job at honing in on why we choose to bury traumas and destructive behaviors, both past and present.\n\n​\n\nFascinating and intensely detailed, “Run Away” is an astonishing web involving an array of seemingly unrelated characters and circumstances that all weave themselves together in the end. The show puts a spotlight on the secrets we keep from those we love most, and how, once exposed, those skeletons can alter who we are and how we view our loved ones forever. Amid the vast array of clues that slowly reveal themselves, to shootouts and haunting flashbacks, the show is as expansive as it is intense. Moreover, just as viewers believe they’ve grasped the truth, the plot shifts, moving the narrative into a different direction. In the end, the series reminds us that digging into other people’s lives may bring you answers, but you may not want to face these truths when they come to light.\n\n“Run Away” premieres on Netflix Jan. 1.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:25:03.986340"}

We even broke news about one of them this year. That got us thinking about buzzy projects down the years that were made but still haven’t seen the light of day.\n\nCheck out our piece below on 18 such projects, all starry features that were largely shot, but sadly haven’t had a release for one reason or another.\n\nA Woman of the Sea\n\nA Woman of the Sea, also known by its working title Sea Gulls, is the unreleased silent film produced in 1926 by Charlie Chaplin. The love story set against the sea was a starring vehicle for his former leading lady Edna Purviance. But it is one of only two lost Chaplin films, having been destroyed by Chaplin himself as a tax write-off, despite six months of filming and an estimated $90,000 spent on production. Filmmaker John Grierson, who reportedly saw some of the film before the negatives were burned, called it “extraordinarily beautiful — but empty.”\n\nThe Deep\n\nOrson Welles worked on this film from 1966-1969 and still harbored hopes it might be completed in the years after that. The drama was to follow a couple’s honeymoon trip aboard a yacht. The production was plagued by financial and technical problems and as work on the film became more sporadic and difficult, Welles is said to have become increasingly withdrawn. The original negative was lost and the film only exists in two work prints. Despite its challenges, lead Jeanne Moreau was among those to look back on the production as “a fantastic experience,” adding that “the only disastrous thing was that later on, the film disappeared.” Another lead actor in the film, Laurence Harvey, died in 1973, effectively ending hopes the project could film its last remaining scenes.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe Day The Clown Cried\n\nJerry Lewis in ‘The Day the Clown Cried’ Everett Collection\n\nThis 1972 Swedish-French drama, directed by and starring Jerry Lewis, was about a circus clown imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. The film has gained notoriety and mystique over the decades both for its controversial premise and because it never saw the light of day. Lewis repeatedly insisted the film would never be released, but later donated an incomplete copy to the Library of Congress in 2015 under orders that it wasn’t to be made available until 2024. A journalist screened the five-hour footage that year but said that the film wasn’t complete. It later emerged that a complete copy had existed but was stolen by an actor in the film.\n\nBig Bug Man\n\nThis unreleased American animated TV film starred Brendan Fraser and Marlon Brando, marking the latter’s last film role. It followed a candy company worker who gains special abilities after being bitten by insects. The hand-drawn film is reported to have cost as much as $20 million. Pic was written by Bob Bendetson, who also wrote episodes of The Simpsons, and was directed Bendetson and Peter Shin. Brando was originally asked to voice a male character, but Brando thought it would be fun to voice the old lady Mrs. Sour instead. Brando reportedly wore a blonde wig, a dress, white gloves, and full makeup while recording the voice. An unwell Brando died shortly after recording his part in the film. It was originally scheduled for release between 2006 and 2008, but never got a release.\n\nHippie Hippie Shake\n\nHippie Hippie Shake is an unreleased UK drama from Working Title chronicling the release of an Australian satirical magazine in 1960s London and the staff’s trial for distributing an obscene issue. Cillian Murphy and Sienna Miller starred in the film, which was repeatedly delayed. In 2007 the film finally began shooting, but by 2009 creative differences led to director Beeban Kidron quitting during post. By 2011, Working Title admitted the film wouldn’t be released.\n\nBlack Water Transit\n\nBlack Water Transit is an unreleased 2009 American crime-drama directed by Tony Kaye of American History X fame. Laurence Fishburne and Karl Urban are among cast of the film set in post-Katrina New Orleans, where a shipping exec finds himself getting more than he bargained for after agreeing to help feds expose a smuggler. The film got bogged down in various complex lawsuits over many years. Along the way, exec producer David Bergstein went to prison for a separate fraud charge.\n\nThe Magic 7\n\nThe Magic 7 is an animated TV film written and directed by Roger Holzberg. The film centers on the adventures of two children and a dragon as they fight the arch-enemies of Earth. The stellar voice cast included John Candy, Michael J Fox, Ted Danson, Ice-T, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore and James Earl Jones. It was slated to air on Earth Day, April 22, 1997, but was postponed. After later plans for a 2005 release, the film was again suspended.\n\nGore\n\nBased on Jay Parini’s biography of Gore Vidal, the 2017-shot film was in post-production when Netflix decided to cancel it following the sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey. It would have been an early prestige Netflix original and came on the heels of the streamer’s hit collaboration with Oscar winner Spacey on House of Cards. But the film was killed in post. There’s speculation online that the largely finished film privately screened for one or two top-ranking Netflix executives at the time.\n\nLeslie Grace as Batgirl Warner Bros Discovery\n\nThe DC Comics adaptation is possibly the highest-profile instance of an unreleased movie. Directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film starred Leslie Grace as Batgirl alongside JK Simmons, Jacob Scipio, Brendan Fraser, Michael Keaton and Ivory Aquino. Joss Whedon was originally attached to write and direct but left a year into work on the movie. El Arbi and Fallah were hired to direct in 2021 when the film was confirmed as an HBO Max original. In summer 2022, DC Films and WBD announced that, while the film had entered post-production, the studio no longer planned to release it as scheduled due to the company’s cost-cutting measures and a refocus on theatrical releases. The shelving of a nearly complete, $90 million film for tax write-off purposes drew widespread condemnation, but it wasn’t the last time a studio pulled such a move.\n\nScoob 2\n\nThis HBO Max mystery-comedy, scheduled for release in 2022, was a prequel to the studio’s 2020 film Scoob!, both based on the Scooby-Doo franchise. Mark Hamill, McKenna Grace and Maya Hawke were among cast but WBD shelved the film citing cost-cutting measures and an intent to refocus on theatrical films over projects made for streaming.\n\nNewborn/Solitary\n\nThis Nate Parker drama, shot back in 2020, follows a man who is released into a newly self-isolating society after years of solitary confinement. David Oyelowo is in the lead role and support comes from Barry Pepper, Olivia Washington and Jimmie Fails. Parker’s career hit major turbulence some years before this movie was shot and the film’s financier Bron has subsequently gone under, making a release even harder. We hear from sources that there may still be hope of a release for this one, however. Watch this space.\n\nThe Way of the Wind\n\n‘The Way of the Wind’\n\nFew films have been shrouded in more mystery over the years than Terrence Malick‘s The Way of the Wind, a perennial entrant on our list of movies that could appear at major festivals. Malick drew a typically stacked cast for his retelling of Jesus’ life including Mark Rylance, Matthias Schoenaerts, Aidan Turner, Ben Kingsley, Joseph Fiennes, Tawfeek Barhom, Matthieu Kassovitz and Douglas Booth. Rylance is said to play Satan and some in the cast play Saints. The film is understood to have shot in 2019. Kassovitz told French media that Malick filmed an average of five hours per day, leading to 3,000 hours of footage by the end of filming. As of 2025, Malick is reportedly still editing, so there’s hope we may still see this one.\n\nAs we revealed, the conspiracy thriller directed by Mark Pellington and starring Bryan Cranston, Lily Gladstone, Jennifer Ehle and others, shot early this year but came to an abrupt halt when the money ran out and cast and crew stopped being paid. Cranston told us he wouldn’t return to set until the crew got their money, but so far, the project remains in limbo.\n\nKung Fury 2\n\nThis martial arts comedy sequel, directed by David Sandberg, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Tyler Burton Smith, features a starry cast of Sandberg, Michael Fassbender, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Alexandra Shipp, Jorma Tacone and David Hasselhoff. Filming took place in 2019 but wok on post stopped in late 2020 due to a lawsuit with investors, and the film’s release was indefinitely delayed. As of December 2025, the film remains incomplete, with legal issues still ongoing.\n\nAll Starr Weekend\n\nThis all-star sports comedy-drama, written and directed by Jamie Foxx, marked his directorial debut. Foxx also acted in the film with Jeremy Piven, Eva Longoria, Robert Downey Jr, Ken Jeong, Gerard Butler, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Szohr and others. The premise is said to be about two truck drivers who get tickets to see their favorite players in the NBA All-Star Game. After many twists and turns, the guys find themselves and their NBA heroes in a precarious life-or-death situation. Filming began in 2016. Foxx previously said he would portray a “white, racist cop” and “managed to convince Robert Downey Jr. to play a Mexican” in the film. The project was originally scheduled for release in 2018 but was delayed multiple times. By 2022, it was shelved.\n\nThe Long Home\n\nJames Franco directed and stars in this indie drama alongside Josh Hutcherson, Tim Blake Nelson, Courtney Love, Ashton Kutcher, Josh Hartnett and Giancarlo Esposito. Filming began in May 2015 and the film went through post, but after an actress on the film accused Franco of inappropriate sexual behavior it has never been released.\n\nThe Mothership\n\nHalle Berry in ‘The Mothership’ YouTube screenshot\n\nThe Mothership, another unreleased Netflix project, is a sci-fi starring Halle Berry, Molly Parker and Omari Hardwick. The synopsis for Matt Charman’s directorial debut reads: “One year after her husband mysteriously vanishes from their rural farm, single mother Sara Morse and her children discover a strange, extraterrestrial object underneath their home, which leads them to embark on a race to find their husband and father.” Filming wrapped in 2021, but by 2024 Netflix announced it no longer planned to release the film due to the lengthy post-production and said it was never completed. Netflix content chief Bela Bajaria would later say of the film’s canceled release: “Everybody just felt like it was the right thing to not do it.”\n\nGolden\n\nMichel Gondry’s musical, shot in 2024, was said to be inspired by Pharrell Williams’ childhood in Virginia Beach, with Williams on board to write original songs for the film. Kelvin Harrison, Halley Bailey, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Janelle Monae and Brian Tyree Henry were among the starry cast of the ambitious project, which was initially slated to be released in the U.S. by Universal in May 2025. In February, it was reported that due to producer disagreements the $20M+ film would be permanently shelved and not offered to other studios for completion and/or distribution.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:25:04.322481"}

The adorable videos were discovered by rabid “Heated Rivalry” fans shortly after Storrie became an instant star when the first two episodes of the queer hockey romance series premiered on HBO Max just a month ago.\n\n“He was on to something,” Storrie says looking back at his pre-teen self. “He got me here. He was part of it.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhat would 25-year-old Storrie say to his younger self now? “I would say, ‘Cut that damn hair,’” he cracks, before pausing to give it a think. “I would tell him to make more stuff sooner, make more of his own stuff sooner. Just be more diligent about not just being an actor, as in trying to get cast in something and waiting for opportunities. I would be like, ‘Try putting yourself in your own things.’”\n\nStorrie continues, “I love that little guy. I love him. I used to not like him.”\n\nIt wasn’t easy for a kid like him growing up in Odessa, Texas.\n\n“I was this artist, sissy boy in West Texas that didn’t want to play football,” he explains. “I wanted to play pretend and play dress up and disappear into weird worlds and entertain and try to connect with people that way, and that was just not the norm out there.”\n\nThat kid is now one of Hollywood’s hottest young talents.\n\nStorrie stars in “Heated Rivalry” as Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hocky champion having a steamy sex-filled years-long affair with his Canadian counterpart Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams). The show — an adaptation of the “Game Changers” novels — chronicles Rozanov and Hollander’s relationship as it goes from something purely physical to to being a deeply romantic and emotional relationship.\n\nThe sixth and final episode of Season 1 finds Rozanov visiting Hollander at his cottage. They finally admit to each other that they’re in love. But then Hollander unexpectedly comes out to his parents as not only being gay but also in a relationship with his career arch-nemesis as his father walks in on the couple kissing after making an unannounced trip to the cottage.\n\nI spoke to Storrie over Zoom video from his Los Angeles-area home ahead of the season finale.\n\nWere you surprised Ilya was the first to say, “I love you”? He said it in the Russian monologue in Episode 5 but this was different because he says it in English and in person.\n\nYeah, but I think this shows Ilya is in it for the long haul and he’s enthusiastic about that.\n\nHe’s also the first to refer to them as boyfriends.\n\nThat’s the thing about these eastern Europeans. They don’t let you in on it. But once you’re in, you’re in for life.\n\nWhat was it like walking into the cottage for the first time?\n\nThat was the element of the story that I was most excited to get to because it’s really cool the way that Jacob Tierney wrote it. There’s this kind of cool crescendo where it was so fast and rapid — the editing, the writing – with so much energy upfront, and then it kind of lands and we’re just two people in a house for a few days. As an actor, that’s where a lot of the cool acting moments are, where we really get to sit in some of those scenes for a long, long time. It’s kind of the episode where there’s officially a catharsis. People don’t realize because of all the intimate scenes but this story really is about people falling in love at a distance. To finally see that come together, there’s a catharsis.\n\nI think viewers may go into Episode 6 thinking it’s going to be a sex fest because Shane and Ilya will be by themselves. There’s some sex, but the episode is about much more than that.\n\nYou get to kind of breathe. They get to be normal on some level, which is what Jacob talks about when he says the “happy ending.” I think what he’s referring to is being emotionally regulated, emotionally aware enough to look each other in the eyes and be like, “I love you, let’s do this.” And then whatever that looks like afterwards, they’re like, “We’re going to sign up for it. We’re signed up and we’re locked in.”\n\nAnd then you literally ride off into the sunset when Shane and Ilya get in the car and leave Shane’s parents’ house.\n\nWe filmed that twice. I don’t know which take they ended up using, but the first take, because we sit there for three or four minutes — we do the full length of that song, which I fucking love — Hudson and I just kind of rode in silence and just cried during that whole scene. As actors, we were like, “We’re killing. We’re in it. This is real, we’re so in love.” Then the music stops and Jacob comes around and is like, “Alrighty, let’s do one where you guys don’t look like you want to kill yourselves. Let’s start over.” He was like, “Be cute. This happy. This is fun.” We interpreted it in a very dramatic way. But, yeah, we literally get to ride off into the sunset.\n\nI think Shane and his mom’s talk outside is going to resonate so much with people. Every kids wants to hear their parents apologize for something they had or hadn’t done.\n\nThey’re both accepting the truth of the matter, and that lets them actually heal from it, rather than it just being a placate-y kind of thing to each other.\n\nMy friend Ben texted me this morning and said the show has “rewired” his brain and he feels he can now finally be able to pursue a relationship.\n\nWow. It’s all about love, baby and realizing the stuff we internalize from the outside world hurts and it affects us. But at the end of the day, you gotta do your thing — whatever that is.\n\nYou’ve talked about being ostracized in high school when some classmates found those Actorboy222 videos. What would you say to those people now?\n\nI don’t feel any sort of way about it. I don’t really villainize anyone no matter how nasty they get because I fully do believe that people are doing their best. I think that people are hurt. I think everyone is so insecure and sad, and we all have these things that are so tender to us, and I just feel blessed to be to have had a human experience that’s been just rugged enough to give me that perspective, to be like, “I don’t really give a shit what words you use to describe me, or if you try to embarrass me because I’ve embarrassed myself a million fucking times. I don’t give a shit anymore. So bring it on. I don’t feel bad about it because, especially how visible everything is now on the internet, if you’re a nasty person, I think that just makes you look nasty. I don’t need to try and make you look nasty. I just try to hold myself with grace and understanding. If you’re trying to belittle someone, it’s probably because you feel pretty small yourself because I know when I’ve been mean in the past — we’ve all done things — it’s because I felt this big [he pinches a thumb and finger together]. I felt itty bitty.\n\nBefore we go, I have to ask – do you actually like tuna melts?\n\nI don’t think I’ve had a real legit tuna melt. Maybe I had one from Subway once. We didn’t eat the best when I was growing up.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:43:12.172211"}

The guy was much like Marty.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAround the same time, he became obsessed with Gabriel’s 1982 song, which he says he listened to over 1,000 times. “I decided to set the footage to that song, and it just worked. Something was happening there; it felt mythic,” Safdie explains. He adds, “There was a contemporary quality to seeing the anachronistic music paired with the ‘40s or early ‘50s.”\n\nSafdie explains how the new wave-flavored music actually makes sense with the film’s themes. “President Reagan was nostalgically in that first era of postmodernism, actively trying to recall the ‘50s. In the face of defeat from Vietnam, culture was really just starting to redo itself in the vein of the ‘50s. You saw it in style. You saw it in movies. ‘Back to the Future’ is literally going back to the ‘50s. But on a very simple level, what happens when you do that is the past starts to feel like it’s haunting the future, and the future feels like it’s haunting the past.”\n\nAt one point, Safdie had written a version of the film where Marty was shown in the 1980s. It was an alternate ending. Safdie says, “He’s at a Tears for Fears concert with his granddaughter, listening to the lyrics of ‘Everybody Wants to Rule the World,’ and reflecting on his youth.”\n\nThat scene was ultimately removed. But Safdie stayed committed to the 1980s tunes including New Order’s as “propulsive, energetic, and fun” while still exploring the concept of the past and future in conversation.\n\nFor the score, Safdie turned to composer Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never), who scored both “Good Time” and “Uncut Gems.” Lopatin, known for inventing vaporwave — a genre of electronic music from the 2010s that offers a nostalgic, surreal take on 1980s music — was the perfect choice to tie the film’s needle-drop moments together. Lopatin says there was no real differentiation between the game of table tennis that Marty plays and his spirit. “He’s buoyant and energetic, and no one believes in him. There’s an energy to him, a buoyancy and a lightness that is mirrored in the game itself,” he says.\n\nLopatin used fast, percussive strikes to keep the score melodic, incorporating mallet strikes to mirror the ping-pong balls. He notes, “Those mallet sounds are also really prominent in new wave music and synth-pop of the ‘80s.”\n\nLopatin was inspired by the concept of memory and time, as well as that original ending. “The score goes back to, what would it be like to think back on your coming of age in the 1950s while hearing Tears for Fears blasting in your ears, and maybe you’re side by side with your children, but somewhere else in your mind?” The result, in Lopatin’s words, was “an abstraction of that Tears for Fears concert.” He describes it as what happens when the present dissolves, and memory and the present converge. “The score is a kind of abstraction or an undercurrent — a symbolic wave of what was in the script.”\n\nTo align with the songs, which also include New Order’s “The Perfect Kiss,” Lopatin used digital synthesizers from the 1980s, including the Yamaha DX7 from 1983. He also incorporated flutes, saxophones, and string arrangements on top.\n\nHis score became was an expression of Marty’s youth, energy and ambition. If Marty is a builder and a bridge between worlds — past, present, and future — so too is the score and its accompanying songs. Safdie concludes, “I think all those things coming together in sync with one another — the synchronicity — has that additive effect of like, ‘Oh my god, this movie’s teeming with life.’”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:45:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:55:50.728184"}

Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Morton said he decided to purchase the domain names after Trump “began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“I thought, Yep, that name’s going on the building,” Morton said in the interview. “The rest followed on schedule.” Morton had previously bought domain names domain names associated with Rep.

But I expected that I would’ve been on the stage too with all the other actors. When Garrett [Morris] and Laraine [Newman] went on the stage there, I was curious as to why I didn’t. No one asked me to. Why was I left aside?”\n\nHe added, “I did bring it up once in a text to Lorne [Michaels] and then took it back. I said, ‘Okay, I take it back, silly.’ But it’s not that silly. Somebody’s made a bad mistake there. I don’t know who it was, but somebody made a mistake. They should’ve had me on that stage.

Maybe shoot something else while she gets used to doing this stuff the way you want it,’” Weaver remembered.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCameron took her advice, she added. Weaver said: “He’s a good guy. I really do think Jim has mellowed.”\n\nThe actor also remembered getting dinner with Cameron after the two wrapped production on “Aliens” and “he hadn’t been like that directing. He was wildly funny, witty. I can understand why that guy couldn’t come out during ‘Aliens,’ because that was a tough shoot, especially for him. Let’s put it this way: I’m glad I wasn’t shooting ‘The Abyss’ with him.”\n\nWeaver is referring to Cameron’s 1989 thriller starring Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The film’s production was fraught, to say the least, with the cast and crew’s health and safety constantly in jeopardy. As recounted by SyFy: “Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on set, and Harris admitted he broke into a fit of sobbing while driving home one day because of the stress. At one point, a lightning storm ripped a hole in the black tarp covering the tank, and since repairing it took too much time and production was already running over, they started shooting at night. Too much exposure to chlorine burned divers’ skin and turned their hair white.”\n\n“We were guinea pigs, in a way,” Harris once told Entertainment Weekly. “Jim wasn’t quite sure how this was all gonna go down… [in the drowning scene I was] screaming at her to come back and wake up, and I was slapping her across the face and I see that they’ve run out of film in the camera — there’s a light on the camera — and nobody had said anything. And Mary Elizabeth stood up and said, ‘We are not animals!” and walked off the set. They were going to let me just keep slapping her around!”\n\nWhatever Cameron was like on past sets did not deter Weaver from reuniting with him on the “Avatar” franchise. She’s starred in all three “Avatar” movies so far. Her co-star Stephen Lang told The Times that “a part of Jim that has leavened and lightened much over the years,” adding: “I think he embarked upon a course of self-improvement, and I don’t say that this is actually necessarily a conscious thing that he did; I just think that he’s kind of geared that way.”\n\n“Marinating, maybe, is a good term, right?” Cameron himself told the publication. “It’s not like I was a screamer all day long. But every once in a while. Everybody’s entitled to a bad day. If you’re not doing the job, then get out of my way.”\n\nCameron’s latest, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” is now playing in theaters nationwide.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:59:36 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T20:28:32.391130"}

At a holiday party Saturday night celebrating the birthdays of Roadside Attractions co-president Erik d&#8217;Arbeloff, who turned 60, and his son Lucas, who turned 21, I had a number of conversations with various industry types and Academy voters in the crowd at Smog Shoppe on [&#8230;]", "content": "A column chronicling conversations and events on the awards circuit.\n\nAt a holiday party Saturday night celebrating the birthdays of Roadside Attractions co-president Erik d’Arbeloff, who turned 60, and his son Lucas, who turned 21, I had a number of conversations with various industry types and Academy voters in the crowd at Smog Shoppe on La Cienega. It is always interesting to see — especially on the cusp of the new rear — just how many have yet to see so many of the Oscar contenders at this late date in the game.\n\nNomination balloting begins on January 12 at 9 a.m. PT and ends January 16 at 5 p.m. PT. Fortunately, they have the two-week holiday break (some key companies shut down for the entire time) so, if so inclined, Oscar voters who are usually last on the trail have a chance to catch up after slews of critics orgs and even President Barack Obama have weighed in on the field.\n\nWB AWARDS\n\nYes there is a dedicated crowd of AMPAS voters who try to keep up and see what’s out there in a timely fashion, yet unless you are One Battle After Another, Sinners, Frankenstein or Avatar: Fire and Ash, or maybe a handful of other titles, an average audience of AMPAS members and their guests on a decent turnout might be around 200 in the 1000-seat Samuel Goldwyn Theatre, where official Academy screenings are held. On a recent weekend, about 90 turned out for the prime Sunday show of Gus Van Sant’s Dead Man’s Wire, a little more than half that for Lucy Liu’s terrific performance in the indie drama Rosemead the next Saturday — and that was with Q&As with many of the principals involved. Of course the Academy has a digital screening room now — like most voting groups — so it is harder to lure voters out of their homes unless it is very high profile and a “must see” on a large movie screen (the Academy’s is the best in town). Other screening opportunities that come with Q&As receptions and food at places like Ross House, Soho House, The London Hotel and other favored venues draw their fair share, so it is not for lack of opportunity to see these films.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nNetflix\n\nIn a good move, AMPAS tweaked voting rules last season to assure that those casting ballots have actually seen the films nominated. Again, that is only after nominations for the final ballot in all categories. “You do not need to save movie stubs, tickets or receipts,” the academy wrote in its Octeber 30, 2024 email to its voting members. “This is an honor system.”\n\nSo how it works is members who watch on the Academy’s official steaming site will be automatically verified. For films that members watch somewhere else, they must indicate it by marking “watched” next to the film’s name on the service or app. Thus the Academy is able to notify members what films they still need to watch before voting. Of course, who is to say some don’t just begin a movie on the service and leave the room? I don’t believe that happened widely and this is a good step forward, but it is only after nominations, not deciding what gets nominated, a much wider swatch of films that can be daunting for any diligent member.\n\nIncreasingly though, it feels like the Academy, and to be fair many other groups including critics, zero in on a handful of movies and vote down the ballot, even with requirements to see everything. The triumph of Anora seemed like that kind of case, an indie movie more widely seen than you might imagine in the Academy (and that might have been due to the new requirements for viewing every nominee) and getting checked off on the ballot in just about every category it was in. It’s a distinct advantage for those movies that can break through at the last minute and not be on members’ “Oh yeah, I have to see that one” or “I should see that, just haven’t had time yet.” lists. So hopefully in the next two and a half weeks voters will find the time to see more films pre-nomination balloting, though I am getting the feeling this might be one of those years where the ultimate winners seem more predictable, at least in conversations I have been having.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio in ‘One Battle After Another’ Warner Bros./Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n“So is it already a done deal, we know what’s winning?” one veteran producer and Oscar voter asked me as I stood at the bar at the Roadside party. And yes, I immediately knew he was talking about One Battle After Another, the Warner Bros title that is not also a description of its current status as a studio for sale. I moderated the official AMPAS screening back in September to what is quite unusual: a turn-away crowd at the Goldwyn and a massive standing ovation for Paul Thomas Anderson in addition to enthusiastic receptions for its cast members, so its success and popularity in the industry is not surprising. Anderson is overdue and the movie is one that filmmakers love.\n\nI am sure the producer was also referring to the endless drumbeat of early wins on the critics awards circuit for the movie; it won at the Gothams, the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles and New York film critics, and has racked up numerous other Best Picture prizes wherever it seems to go. Usually, critics groups aren’t so aligned with industry sentiment, but that appears to be the trajectory here. With a leading nine Golden Globes nominations and 14 more at Critics Choice, it is in as strong a position as you can possibly be at this point in the game. But being a front-runner this early is treacherous: The aforementioned Anora didn’t establish itself as the one to beat until February, when it won at the delayed Critics Choice ceremony and then back to back the next night at the DGAs and PGAs. Without question the most important voices are yet to be heard from, and won’t be until after the New Year with all the guilds, BAFTA and then finally the Academy. Many a front-runner has been tripped up on the way to Oscar Sunday, so always beware.\n\n‘Sinners’ Warner Bros.\n\nWhat could stop it in its tracks? Start with another Warner Bros title, Sinners, which is also not a name the WBD board uses to describe the Ellisons. While One Battle has 14 CCA nominations, Sinners leads everyone with 17 and was named in every single category it was eligible for on the Oscar shortlists. Could that film change the momentum game and surprise, especially for a movie released in the unfriendly Oscar month of April? Will Warners find itself split with love for both Anderson and Sinners director Ryan Coogler? These are the questions I am asking. If there is a split, will it be to the benefit of Guillermo del Toro’s Netflix hit Frankenstein? Wouldn’t that be a touch of irony considering all that is going on in town these days. Del Toro is enormously beloved and the movie is a marvel of the kind of craft Oscar has always loved, or at least used to love.\n\n‘Hamnet’ Agata Grzybowska/Focus Features\n\nThen there is Focus Features’ Hamnet, a gut-wrenching wallop from Oscar winner Chloe Zhao (Nomadland). This isn’t just some indie movie. Its producers are Amblin’, Steven Spielberg and Sam Mendes, okay? They have a lot of power and persuasion in Hollywood, and this film does what overall you want every film to do, to leave you with a shot to the heart and an emotional ending like no other. That counts for a lot, and you could tell right from the first screening in Telluride that it landed. Focus has never won the Best Picture Oscar (neither has Netflix), and Universal is likely to be lending its heft to its campaign too, but remember they also have their own Wicked: For Good , hoping it finds its mojo in the Best Picture race this year or is relegated again ulitmately to just crafts recognition. It’s impressive showing on the Oscar shortlists with a co-leading 8 is promising. Yest it is always hard for Part 2’s to prevail, but don’t tell that to The Godfather Part II or Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.\n\nTimothée Chalamet in ‘ Marty Supreme A24\n\nAnd what of A24’s Christmas juggernaut, Marty Supreme which already seems a shoe-in for marketing movie of the year thanks to its star Timothee Chalamet who also seems in line for the top marketing job at A24 in his spare time. Critically and perhaps boxoffice-wise (it came in a surprising second to Avatar: Fire And Ash on Christmas day) it is poised to be a spoiler since it also set records for limited release last weekend. Can the Chalamet express go all the way to the Dolby station?\n\nThen there is the question of the ever-growing international vote in the Academy, the swing voters who really can make a difference and this year there are some prime contenders with Sentimental Value, It Was Just An Accident, Sirat, The Secret Agent all coming out of Cannes and gunning next for Oscar. This year can especially be telling in terms of the power of the international vote where purely America-centric movies like One Battle and Sinners may find a tougher audience – or not. Great filmmaking is great filmmaking no matter what part of the world it is showing us.\n\nSo thinking about it my response to that producer I told you about might be not so fast. Stay tuned.\n\nOSCAR’S COMEBACK OF THE MONTH – DECEMBER\n\nIf One Battle After Another has been the presumed leader of the Oscar race since its September debut, Warner Bros took a distinctly different campaign strategy with their other juggernaut, Sinners which debuted way back in April, a release date where it is easy to be forgotten by the time the actual season rolls around and Fall releases, even Summer releases in some cases (we’re talking about YOU Oppenheimer and Barbie), take precedent in the race for Hollywood’s most prestigious honor. Basically Warners held back its relaunch until November when star Michael B. Jordan was available after wrapping shooting on The Thomas Crown Affair in Europe, and especially this month when it seemed Sinners was everywhere on the FYC circuit, with numerous stars hosting FYC events aimed at regaining the attention of Oscar voters, and other groups. It certainly seems to have worked as the film led the aforementioned Oscar shortlists with 8, as well as the aforementioned Critics Choice Awards with a near-record 17 (final voting is now open through Jan 2 at CCA and through Jan 3 for Golden Globes while SAG announced nominations Jan 7), both indicating the enthusiastic backing it has in crafts and below the line categories, something very important within the Academy as it indicates strong across the board support among the overall membership, not just the marquee acting, writing and directing categories. Sinners could very well lead all comers when Oscar nominations are announced on January 22.\n\nAmong those hosting Sinners events were Spike Jonze, Christopher Nolan, Lupita Nyong’o, Questlove, Viola Davis, Austin Butler, Kenneth Branagh, Destin Daniel Cretton, Idris Elba, Ben Stiller, Denzel Washington, and Barry Jenkins.\n\nDenzel Washington (R) moderates ‘Sinners’ with co-star Delroy Lindo at Harmony Gold Theatre.

He meets an injured man protecting a briefcase holding something valuable enough to shoot Henry in the hand to try to protect it.\n\nNoah Schnapp as Will Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThere was Will’s (Noah Schnapp) emotional coming out scene, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy’s (Natalia Dyer) cathartic breakup scene, Max’s (Sadie Sink) epic return to the world of the living and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and so much more.\n\nHere to break it all down for Variety — and tease where things will go in the “Stranger Things” series finale — is executive producer Shawn Levy, who directed Episode 6 and co-directed Episode 7 alongside the Duffer brothers.\n\nWe now know Eleven is the most successful of Brenner’s experiments because she tolerated the blood transfusion from Henry the best. And this means that even if the team kills Vecna, this cycle is not over, because the military wants to use El to make more kids like her. Kali tells El they should kill themselves to end it. Can you talk about creating those life and death stakes for Eleven going into the series finale?\n\nWell, first of all, that was incredibly concisely summarized.\n\nThank you.\n\nI hope that if anyone ever asks me to summarize the plot revelations of Volume 2, I can just remember your words, because they were incredibly succinct. I mean, to your point, these are profound existential questions being asked in Volume 2. And this deep questioning of, what is sacrifice? What is a worthy sacrifice? And how do you put the needs of the many in front of the needs of oneself? These are age-old existential questions, and I am really excited for fans to see our show wrestle with them.\n\nWe hopefully do it in ways that are emotional and still entertaining. But when you have characters like Holly and El questioning profound life and death values, like the ones they wrestle with in Volume 2, those scenes need to be handled with care. They need to be written with nuance, and they then need to be performed and directed with sensitivity to the weight of the issues being grappled with.\n\nSadie Sink as Max Mayfield in Season 4 of “Stranger Things.” Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhat did you want to show with the scene where Max and Holly (Nell Fisher) say goodbye in Vecna’s mind in Episode 6? How did you work through what real-world Max would look like, and what she could feasibly do to help now that she’s back?\n\nThe end of Episode 6, that was a really memorable day because I was given the privilege of directing a scene that required both actresses to deliver big time and with tremendous emotional weight. The writing was excellent. The actors, Nell and Sadie, stepped up so impressively, but it had this added layer of meaning for Sadie and I, because Episode 6 of Season 5 is in some ways an echo of our “Dear Billy” episode [Episode 4, Season 4] that Sadie and I are sort of connected for life in from Season 4. A similar red void, a similar epic run using both real speed and slow motion, and set against, no coincidence here, a new orchestration of “Running Up That Hill.”\n\nIt’s certainly a sequence that I’ll cherish forever, because it served as a bookend to “Dear Billy” in many ways, and it allowed Sadie and I to revisit that sequence from the end of “Dear Billy” that we will carry with us forever. Because even if we wanted to leave it behind, audiences around the world remind us of that sequence pretty much every day of our lives. So the design of this abstract red void with these extraordinary, odd, otherworldly structures, but with a glimpse of the world that is on the other side, the aspirational yearning that Max has carried with her is manifested. And when she looks through that cloudy portal and sees herself with Lucas next to her, still holding vigil, it was such an emotion premise for a scene, and I think it’s clear that it resonated emotionally for Sadie and all of us who were part of that sequence.\n\nOne day I’ll never forget filming Season 5 was that first scene after Max comes back to life when she is on that table in that laundry room. And it took, like, one take for her and Caleb to deliver some of their most beautiful work in any season. Many of us were teary as we watched these beautiful actors do such great work. I think that Max’s superpower, having returned to life, to the world, is that, as I think we say in the show, she’s been on the other side. She has, in some ways, mapped the target, and can therefore be an essential ally in strategizing how we go at that target, how we go after Vecna.\n\nNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nCan you talk about the choice to have Nancy and Jonathan’s relationship, which was built on a deep trauma bond, end by them having a new deeply traumatic shared experience that caused them to be honest?\n\nI love that the Duffers and the writers named the fact on camera, in character, they named the fact that the Nancy-Jonathan connection has been rooted in shared trauma. So I like that there’s an awareness, not only in the writing of the show, but in the characters. And we always knew that this was going to be the watershed “Jancy” scene that was almost a decade in the making, and it’s a long scene. It’s incredibly rich in its writing, and it’s acting, and Natalia and Charlie prepared for months for that scene. And I think in acknowledging the shared trauma in their history, Jonathan and Nancy are able to be honest about their past and clear-eyed in assessing their present and would-be future.\n\nWhat’s it like to direct the revelations about what Vecna actually going to do, turn the world into the Upside Down? Is Vecna just a nihilist?\n\nWell, for one thing, I would say that for those of us, and anyone who has seen “The First Shadow” on stage, that “Stranger Things” play fills in a lot of blanks about Henry Creel’s backstory. And for me personally, knowing that I was going to be directing Jamie as Henry/One/Vecna in our final season, the stage play gave me a much deeper empathy for Vecna, and it gave me an understanding of the wounds he carries, where they came from, and how formative they were in his youth.\n\nSo yes, current day Vecna seems to be just straight up nihilistic, but the world has hurt him so much that now he just wants to hurt it back.\n\nDirecting Noah Schnapp in Will’s coming out scene in Episode 7, did you have any specific discussions about preferences in what Will would do and how others would react — even subtle details?\n\nCertainly that’s a question worth asking the Duffers. So Matt, Ross and I all chatted and worked with Noah well in advance of shooting that scene. And I personally ran through the scene with Noah and talked through it and the evolution of Will’s sharing in it. Bear in mind that Noah, quite famously and quite publicly, brings personal experience to that scene. So we came with a lot of instincts about how to approach it. And between Matt and Ross and I, and with the benefit of exceptional writing by the Duffers, it was about calibrating the feeling and calibrating how emotional Will gets at what stage of the scene.\n\nAnd as far as all of the listeners, all of those reaction shots that for me personally, as just a viewer, those are what really break me. Those cutaways to Jonathan to Robin to Max to Mike, those are just authentic reactions of Noah’s castmates and friends as their buddy gave a powerhouse performance in an all-timer of a scene. What you see on screen is what went down on that set, and it’s just authentic and honest and required very little prep or discussion.\n\nMatt Duffer, Ted Sarandos, Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy and Bela Bajaria attend “Stranger Things” Season 5 World Premiere at TCL Chinese 6 Theatres on November 6, 2025 in Hollywood, California. Courtesy of Getty Images for Netflix\n\nWhat was your final day on set like?\n\nLike for everyone, the last day was an emotional day. The two moments I will personally never forget are the very small, intimate read through of the final episode. It was literally the cast and maybe a half-dozen other people that were allowed in that room. I was lucky enough to be one of them — because I’ve walked the long road over a decade with the show — that day. And the way those actors, and particularly those young actors, came undone emotionally as we read it, is something so beautiful. I’ll never forget it.\n\nAnd then on my very last day, I went to the Wheeler basement, and it was empty. No one was shooting there, and I sat on those stairs, and I sat on that couch, and I just steeped myself in 10 years of memories, 10 years of this challenge, and above all, 10 years of this privilege of being a part of this show as both an executive producer and frequent director. It’s changed me forever, and I sat there in the quiet of that iconic basement feeling very grateful.\n\nThe man with briefcase that Henry meets in that mine shaft in the Nevada desert. What’s in that briefcase, Shawn? Is there more to the Henry/Dimension X story of how Henry got his powers that day in the desert than was shown in “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” that’s coming in the finale?\n\nYes. Hard, yes. Emphatic, “yes,” he said, as he nodded his head vigorously.\n\nIs the Abyss, the other world where Henry is — which is connected to Earth via the Upside Down/wormhole — also Dimension X, the place he originally entered when he first got his powers in the desert as a child?\n\nThat is a really great question you should ask the Duffers. And you can tell them that I believe I am correct in saying, no. It’s the Abyss, and I believe the Abyss is not Dimension X. Ask the Duffers, and I can’t wait to read your article, so I can finally understand the answer.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers\n\n• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale\n\n• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T20:46:19.622584"}

I wasn’t sure how I would feel… whether it would be something very emotionally connective because I put the Man of Steel suit back on.

According [&#8230;]", "content": "Tyler Perry has been sued over allegations of sexual assault brought by a new accuser, an actor who appeared in the 2016 movie “Boo! A Madea Halloween.”\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mario Rodriguez alleges that Perry assaulted him on multiple occasions over several years at Perry’s Los Angeles home. According to the complaint, Perry allegedly made unwanted sexual advances toward Rodriguez, including a 2018 incident in which Perry “tightly hugged” him and “grabbed his penis.”\n\nRodriguez, who played “Frat Guy #10” in Perry’s “Boo! A Madea Halloween,” is suing for sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He is also bringing a claim against Lionsgate, distributor of “Boo! A Madea Halloween,” for allegedly ignoring Perry’s actions. Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe complaint describes an incident that allegedly occurred in Perry’s home screening room a few months after they met in 2015. “Mr. Perry then put his hand on Mr. Rodriguez’s leg and began rubbing his inner thigh right next to his penis. Mr. Perry told Mr. Rodriguez ‘It’s ok,’ while he continued to rub his thigh.”\n\nRodriguez alleges that the two broke off contact in 2019 but that Perry would periodically reach out to him after that. The complaint states that Rodriguez was motivated to bring his claim against Perry after reading reports about Derek Dixon’s lawsuit earlier this year.\n\nIn response to Rodriguez’s suit, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Perry, said in a statement shared with Variety, “Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab.”\n\nSpiro was referring to another lawsuit against Perry filed in June. Dixon, an actor who appeared on Perry’s BET series “The Oval,” accused the filmmaker of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nDixon, who appeared in 85 episodes of the drama show, alleged that while staying at the entertainment mogul’s guesthouse in June 2021, Perry grabbed his buttocks while intoxicated. The lawsuit also cited alleged text messages in which Perry is said to have made repeated sexual comments and advances over several years. Dixon is seeking at least $260 million in punitive damages.\n\nJonathan Delshad, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represents Rodriguez and Dixon, pointed to numerous text messages allegedly exchanged between Rodriguez and Perry that bolster his client’s claims.\n\n“Mr. Rodriguez is looking forward to his day in court and holding Mr. Perry accountable for his actions. We do hope a jury awards enough money to make Perry regret his actions,” Delshad said. “Unfortunately, statements like those made by Perry’s attorneys do nothing but enable Mr. Perry to continue to victimize people like Mr. Rodriguez. My client looks forward to a jury’s determination of what happened.”\n\n“Mr. Rodriguez realized that Mr. Perry was continuing to use his power and influence to sexually assault hopeful actors and, with the voice of others, decided that it was time to tell his story, to obtain justice, and to finally stop Mr. Perry,” the new complaint states. “When Perry became aware that Rodriguez was going to file this action, Perry once again reached out to Rodriguez by text, telling Rodriguez that Perry did so much to help Rodriguez and was that Perry was feeling betrayed by Rodriguez.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:05:57 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T22:25:42.100213"}

The Oscar-winning director has been vocal on the “Fire and Ash” press tour that the future of the “Avatar” franchise depends on the third movie being a financial success. Cameron is prepared to end the series if it’s not.\n\n“I don’t know if the saga goes beyond this point. I hope it does,” Cameron told EW. “But, you know, we prove that business case every time we go out… “If we don’t get to make 4 and 5, for whatever reason, I’ll hold a press conference and I’ll tell you what we were gonna do. How’s that?”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCameron said his other option is to novelize his scripts for “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5,” adding: “There’s so much culture and backstory and lateral detail in these characters that’s been worked out. I’d love to do something that’s at that level of granular detail.”\n\nDuring an interview with Variety, Cameron said “we’re getting ahead of ourselves” when asked about “Avatar 3” because “we’ve got to make some money with this one. Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business case yet again. The world has changed. We all know the stats, where theatrical is. It’s been a bad year. It’s starting to perk up a little bit with a couple of recent releases: ‘Wicked: For Good’ has done well, and ‘Zootopia 2’ is doing well. So, we’ll see.”\n\nIt appears Cameron might not need to hold a press tour to reveal the final two “Avatar” movies because “Fire and Ash” is performing quite well at the box office. The movie crossed the $500 million mark at the worldwide box office after one week in theaters and is expected to have strong holds into the new year. The previous two “Avatar” movies both cleared the $2 billion mark worldwide.\n\nJon Landau, the franchise’s late producer, let it slip to Gizmodo in 2022 that “Avatar 5” brings the Na’vi characters to earth, adding: “And we go to it to open people’s eyes, open Neytiri’s eyes, to what exists on Earth.”\n\nCameron has left it up in the air whether or not he will direct the next two “Avatar” movies himself. He told Empire in 2022 that helming the franchise is “all-consuming” and he might want to “pass the baton” to another director starting with “Avatar 4.” But he recently said before “Fire and Ash’s” release that “there’s no reason not to” direct the next sequel himself.\n\n“I’m healthy, I’m good to go. I’m not going to rule it out,” Cameron added. “I mean, I’ve got to make it in a vigorous way, to handle the kind of volume and energy of the work for another six or seven years. You know what I mean?

But what really sold star Hudson Williams on the series was the quiet yet heavy scene in the Season 1 finale that shows Shane’s mother (Christina Chang) asking her son for forgiveness for not allowing him to feel safe enough to come out to her sooner as gay.\n\n“That scene was the scene that ruined me the most when I read the script,” Williams tells me. “It was the scene that I was like, ‘If I don’t get to play Shane Hollander.’ It’s also a scene that’s not in the book, but to me it is the quintessential wrap-up scene to that arc for him and his mom. Period.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFor those who may not already know, “Heated Rivalry” is Jacob Tierney’s six-episode adaptation of Rachel Reid’s queer hockey romance novel series “Game Changers.” The show, acquired for U.S. distribution by HBO Max from Canadian streamer Crave, follows Shane Hollander and Ilya Rosanov (Connor Storrie), two superstar hockey players who fall in love as they navigate a secret years-long affair. The show has been greenlit for a second season.\n\nThe mother-and-son scene filmed over two days. “The first time we couldn’t get through it because it started raining,” Hudson recalls. “And then we came back the next day to shoot it, Jacob goes, ‘I rewrote it.’ So Christina and I are in the little makeup room of this little cottage, memorizing the scene, and it was so beautiful. It made so much sense. It stands on the right side of what I think a parent should be because there are outdated notions. There are old school ways of parenting that maybe we can leave in the past…As someone who thinks of raising their kids in the future and wanting to be a father, this is the environment you have to foster.”\n\nWe truly don’t know until we see her accept him if she is going to accept him or reject him. Will she be like, “You’ve just ruined your career?” But in the end, she’s talking about how this could be good for endorsement deals.\n\nShane gets a release to a degree, but I’m not sure it’s a full one. I think there’s still a degree to Shane where it’s like, a part of me wanted a bigger release. I remember leaving and going, “I wish I could pour myself into it and completely get vulnerable.” As an actor, that’s never really been that hard for me. I was retroactively trying to figure out why am I not fully able to get this. But then, I was like, “Oh, it’s Shane who isn’t able to get that fully.” It’s a little bit of a release he gets but even still, he’s avoiding her a little bit. He can’t look her in the eyes and feel completely like he’s lived to all the standards of what he thinks this unwritten idea of what a man is between them.\n\nI love that Ilya was the first to say, “I love you.” He said it in the Russian monologue, but that doesn’t count for Shane because he didn’t know what Ilya was saying.\n\nThe motherfucker beat me.\n\nWere you surprised he said it first?\n\nYeah, but even though Shane doesn’t say it first, he says all these things that are, if they’re not love, what the fuck are they? You know, “Let’s start a foundation.” He’s staying up in the middle of the night plotting their way. When Ilya says, “You think that far ahead, Hollander?” “I do about this.” Hollander is not a planner. He’s a diligent worker. He’s someone who is routine — dial in, show up in the game today, show up in practice right now. Forget in five years. Be the best hockey player now. It’s out of character to let this game plan run so far ahead. But it is because he loves Ilya so dearly. So I think he, even though he didn’t say it first, he made that cottage a home for Ilya to be able to say it.\n\nI thought the cottage was going to be, excuse my French, a fuck fest. But this was more about the emotional journey and being a couple.\n\nJacob Tierney recently said it — it’s boyfriend.\n\nBut then there’s the blowjob scene. That was comedy.\n\nThat was improv.\n\nWhat?\n\nYeah, to a degree. Connor and I were kind of goofing off in the makeup trailer, which was a cottage that was a two-minute drive away from that cottage, getting ready. I was preparing my monologue the whole morning. I’m prepping it, working it. Then Connor, being the great scene partner he is, he was like, “I’ll be here doing this.” Then he did something and we were hitting each other, goofing off. Then he’s hitting me, hitting me and he did this slap. I was filming myself on my phone doing this. I was like, “Do that again.” I couldn’t hold in my laughter because it was so brilliant. It’s so funny, and it makes sense for where they’re at in the story. I remember showing that to the intimacy coordinator. She was cackling. She’s like, “You have to do that.” Then Jacob was like, “Go for it. Go crazy.” The first take was the first time I broke broke because Connor is taking all the liberties. I am shoving him. I’m slapping him back. I’m putting the phone away to get in the gasps and moans. I’m so happy with how that scene turned out.\n\nShane and Ilya are finally comfortable with each other enough for that. They’ve let their guards down.\n\nI heard Jacob say earlier today, “That’s boyfriends.” You don’t get the blow job on the phone from your fuck buddy or your friends with benefits. You get that when you’re in a relationship. In Episodes 1 and 2, it’s lust — it’s charged and fast. But now we have humor and levity within the sex.\n\nWhat was it like filming in the cottage for the first time?\n\nIt’s when sentiment of the show really matched the sentiment of where we are in filming. That was the last two days of shooting. The last scene we shot was Ilya talking about his mom when he’s on my lap. I remember the first time we walked through there, I was like, “Damn right, Mr. Real Estate! This is a pretty nice cottage.” That was finally where Shane can be as boring as he wants and as fun as he wants. He gets to be everything. They have those two weeks.\n\nAnd then you literally ride off into the sunset.\n\nIt’s still bittersweet. A lot of people have said that’s a very happy ending, but I’m like, “This isn’t a straight story.” This is not the happy ending because they’re still in the closet. They’re not coming out to Reebok, they’re not coming out to anyone. They got caught. It looks more like forgiveness than pride. That’s where they’re at. Forgiveness implies there’s something that was wrongfully done.\n\nThere’s shame around being caught. Just the word “caught” implies something to be ashamed about.\n\nAnd they were just kissing. They’re not fucking butt naked on the countertop.\n\nDo you have any plans to leave the internet?\n\nI have been periodically leaving the internet. I touch into the internet. I try to stay gone, but very luckily, it’s been pretty warm. The hateful comments are easy to disregard to a degree because they’re coming from such vile places of bias or they’re just obnoxious. It’s closer to trolling than it is criticism.\n\nAlso, “Heated Rivalry” is not reality. It’s like a good rom-com where we get to fantasize about love and romance.\n\nIt’s optimistic.\n\nIt’s OK to be optimistic. So many people just want to be negative.\n\nEven queer storytellers sometimes want to double down on pessimism. I think the reason why our show is doing so well is it doesn’t want to reinforce the worst fears.\n\nDo you like tuna melts?\n\nI do, but I don’t eat carbs or cheese. But as a treat, I’ll take a tuna melt with a nice brioche.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:47:24 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T22:58:02.825037"}

With 2025 expected to file between $8.8 billion-$8.9 billion, essentially, it’s the difference of one tentpole not working, so, take your pick: Paramount‘s Running Man, Disney’s Tron: Ares and/or Elio.\n\nThat miss aside, the domestic box office post-Covid has a good thing going on with the third $8.5B+ year in a row. How long then can the entertainment industry keep theatrical moviegoing alive in the face of the potential gloom and doom from Netflix‘s anticipated swallow-up of Warner Bros? The pandemic and the 2023 strikes dashed all hopes of box office rebuilding to a $10B-$11B annual business. Give thanks for what we have: the second-best year at the B.O. post Covid after 2023’s record $9B.\n\nSome studio execs, counting the approximate 12-month regulatory period for Netflix to wed Warners, believe that the theatrical business has three years left of great juice before ticket sales head for a downturn — that is if Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos collapses the exclusive theatrical window to 17-days.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThat’s the worst-case scenario, not a calculated forecast by Ernst & Young.\n\nAnd true, when it comes to David Ellison‘s bid for Warner Bros, it ain’t over, till it’s over; the Paramount CEO unwilling to go quietly into that night. A Warner Bros combo with the Melrose Ave. lot is a whole other set of agita. Still, there’s a small sense of ease with Ellison as he’s known to be a champion for theatrical; he’s even made the lofty promise to keep two major studio slates afloat at 30 movies a year.\n\nThe bigger paranoia for the future of moviegoing lies with a Netflix-Warner Bros dystopian future, particularly since the latter has accepted the former’s bid officially.\n\nHowever, at this point in time, there’s a mixed bag of theories out there in regards to Netflix’s long-term impact on theatrical.\n\nYes, yes, Sarandos has been on a press tour of late, exclaiming that he’s pro-theatrical (despite whatever he’s said in the past), that he’ll respect the terms of Warner Bros theatrical commitments for the slate he inherits (figuring it’s from 2027 or 2028 onward). Netflix and Warner Bros, aside from HBO Max, arguably complement each other: Netflix gets access to a global theatrical distribution network that they’ve never had before, a whole other line of cash.\n\nFor some of the executive sources, who asked to speak anonymously to us, Netflix’s $83 billion pending purchase of Warner Bros was symbolic in a bad way: A price that high indicates that the streamer is out to decimate the theatrical business.\n\nWhy spend all that money, Netflix, when you can license content at a fraction of the cost?\n\nThe belief by cynics is that Netflix wants to be a streaming service. The end. Anyone who is watching a movie in a theater, isn’t at home watching Netflix. How does the streamer even begin to wrap its heads around a downstream ancillary model of international TV windows? Will they, gulp, embrace the cottage industry that is PVOD? But that’s so old fashioned by Los Gatos tech standards. Their desire for a 17-day theatrical window is a farm-to-table model that gets big screen fare on the service ASAP.\n\nHowever, shorter windows leads to the failure of more movies (particularly original and indie titles), which leads to cinemas closing and rising average ticket prices which some say are already too high (EntTelligence reports average ticket price was $13.29 for 2025, premium large format ticket was $17.65).\n\nOther major studio production bosses have a Zen mindset and that’s one studio alone can’t unilaterally crush the theatrical window. But isn’t there a drip factor? Aren’t moviegoing patterns already changing post-Covid? The programmatic reason to attend the cinemas has eroded greatly. Exhibit A: All those dark, upscale, sophisticated movies that failed in the fall. One of the reasons blamed are that shorter windows post pandemic have influenced older adult moviegoers to skip cinemas and wait for titles at home.\n\n(L-R) Netflix-co-CEO Ted Sarandos, WBD Ceo David Zaslav & Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters\n\nNow there’s a faction who gives Sarandos the benefit of the doubt, that he’s not completely the grim reaper of theatrical.\n\nSays who? Myriad Warner Bros insiders who heard him and co-CEO Greg Peters speak on Dec. 17 on the Burbank, CA lot. They say he’s excited about theatrical and the WB asset, and he relayed that passion. Don’t bet against him.\n\nAlso, those giving confidence to Sarandos, are his former exec colleagues who’ve relocated to other motion picture-streamers. They say he’ll size Warner’s theatrical business up, notice its worth properly, be open minded, and not destory it. Not to mention, movies that played in cinemas constantly rank in Netflix’s top 10, and are the drivers of subscriptions and views. Currently, Sony has a pay-one U.S. window with Netflix that’s up for renewal next year.\n\n“If Netflix wanted to kill theatrical, they could have just bought the top three exhibitors for close to $20 billion, which is significantly less than Warner Bros” says one cinema partner who is optimistic about a future with the streamer.\n\nThe next test how Netflix handles theatrical is with Greta Gerwig’s $200M Narnia movie which is on a 28-day exclusive window in global Imax auditoriums. Does the movie go wide? That hasn’t been announced yet. Netflix just bungled the handling of Rian Johnson’s Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery which didn’t play the top three circuits -AMC, Regal and Cinemark- due to a shortened window. As such, the movie made $4M in its first five days versus the $15M+ first week that the previous Netflix-released Knives Out franchise title, Glass Onion, posted (Netflix’s defense is that they kept all their awards prestige titles, i.e. Frankenstein, Jay Kelly, A House of Dynamite on a 17-day theatrical window).\n\nA stat for Netflix to keep in mind: Of the 760 million who attended movies this year in North America per EntTelligence, 21% of them went to see a Warner Bros movie (compare this to Disney, the No. 1 studio, which repped 25% of 2025 annual admissions. Universal pulled in 18.5% of admissions, with Paramount at 6.4%, Sony at 6.3%, Lionsgate at 3.7% and A24 at 2.4%). There’s several billion-dollar plus potential tentpole movies in the mix for next year, i.e. Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, Star Wars: Mandalorian and Grogu, Super Mario Bros Galaxy, Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Some event pics are even fearlessly facing off against each other next Christmas, i.e. Dune: Part III (which will keep Imax screens, and not move) against Avengers: Doomsday. Ya don’t get to $1 billion in 17 days like Zootopia 2 unless people are aware they can’t watch the movie in 17 days (successful Disney movies have an exclusive theatrical window to SVOD that’s typically 100-plus days). After one of the best Christmas holidays at the B.O. post Covid at $68M, and with a mid-budgeted movie like Marty Supreme heading to a $25M-$30M 4-day start, along with a 3D spectacle like James Cameron’s Avatar: Fire and Ash (already past a half billion worldwide), it’s clear the audience still crave the theatrical experience. Audiences delivered Netflix their first No. 1 grossing movie in KPop Demon Hunters Singalong back in August with $19M. The Stranger Things series finale in theaters over New Year’s Eve and Day is buzzed to have sold out myriad auditoriums.\n\nBut after the Warner Bros merger honeymoon is over, two-to-three years from now, if Netflix attempts to take the industry to a 17-day theatrical window, who will stop them? Will exhibition truly back-stop them? Or will they cave in out of financial desperation like they did when they played KPop Demon Hunters after the movie already streamed on Netflix for about a month? Would they reject playing Matt Reeves’ The Batman 2 on a 17-day window? Or play it, because it’s Batman? The movie is currently dated for an Oct. 1, 2027 release. Will the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences protect the theatrical window by insisting that all movies yearning to qualify for the Oscars play at least 30 days exclusively in cinemas? Highly unlikely as Netflix is already a $5M-$10M donor to the Academy Museum. Will the talent reps rise up like they did against former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar’s popcorn project and speak truth to power? And anti-trust federal regulators? Hello, Bueller, are you there?\n\nNo doubt, it will take a village to keep the legacy studio model and the theatrical business alive.\n\nObserves one film financier about the streamer vs. theatrical hostility: “A casino is a great business, yes, for the owners of the casino. It’s bad for everyone else. Everyone who goes through it is a loser, and it’s bad for the town where the casino exists. It’s bad for culture at large. Likewise, a streaming service is a great business for the owner of an SVOD service. Stable cash, no risk to your content. But is it a great business for culture? No.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:42:33 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T02:14:52.172833"}

It’s safe to say, love is in the air. So is horror and the paranormal.\n\nWhose House? Ron’s House\n\nMercedes Ron is a Wattpad star writer, so much so that Prime Video has created a ‘House Of Ron’ brand for all of the upcoming film and series interpretations of her novels. Ron’s Culpables series has defined the modern era of Wattpad adaptations, and in Culpa Mia (My Fault), Culpa Tuya (Your Fault) and Culpa Nuestra (Our Fault) have delivered Prime a hit franchise.\n\nIvory & Ebony Wrapped\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nTwo Enfrentados movies are coming, based on Ron’s two-book series. Marfíl (Ivory) and Ébano (Ebony) are made by Pokeepsie Films, which produced the Culpables trilogy and they tell us they are taking things up a level with the new movies. Ester Expósito (Élite) plays Marfil, the daughter of a Spanish tycoon whose NYC lifestyle is shaken after she is kidnapped and then released. Hugo Diego García (The Substance) is Sebastian, who is recruited as her bodyguard. The two movies were filmed back-to-back and shooting took place in Spain and New York.\n\nBoulevard Of Forbidden Romance\n\nThe first three of Flor M. Salvador’s ‘Boulevard’ series have racked up over 140M reads on Wattpad, and a fourth instalment is on the way. Hopes are high for the movie adaptations, with Sony Pictures and Webtoon making the features. The first movie, Boulevard, is in production in Spain with a screenplay from the pen of YA author Javier Ruescas. The books trace the forbidden romance between high school students Halsey Weigel and Luke Howland. She knows she should stay away from Luke, but is inexplicably drawn to him, seeing beyond the damaged exterior that everyone else is quick to judge.\n\nRunning Hot: Chasing Red\n\nChasing Red is filming in AlUla, Saudi Arabia, and is another much-anticipated Wattpad movie adaptation. Based on Isabelle Ronin’s novel, the plot turns on a straight-A student, Veronica, who refuses to be college heartthrob Caleb’s latest conquest…despite the undeniable chemistry between them. Circumstances see Veronica end up under Caleb’s roof, and secrets unravel in the slow-burn romance. Madelaine Petsch (The Strangers) and Gavin Casalegno (The Summer I Turned Pretty) have signed on as the leads. Mackenzie Munro directs from Lauren Schacher’s screenplay. Stampede Ventures produces alongside Wattpad Webtoon Studios.\n\nThree’s A Charm: Third Shift Society\n\nFlipping the script from webnovel to webcomic, and romance to paranormal, is Third Shift Society. Another one from Wattpad Webtoon Studios, Rehab Entertainment and the Jim Henson Company are also on board the adaptation of Meredith Moriarty’s title. It is being worked up as a supernatural series with Ray Utarnachitt (DC’s Legends of Tomorrow) on writing detail. The story follows Ellie whose world is upended when she meets paranormal detective Ichabod, who may hold answers to her psychic powers. The pair investigate paranormal mysteries involving ghosts, vampires, witches, demons, and more.\n\nSomething’s Wrong In Stagtown\n\nAnother webcomic adaptation in the works is Stagtown, with Benjamin Brewer, Lead VFX Artist on Everything Everywhere All at Once, writing and directing, and Margot Robbie’s Lucky Chap Entertainment and Wattpad Webtoon Studios producing. Comic artist Punko created ‘Stagtown’, and Brewer will bring it to life as a live-action movie. The webcomic follows Frankie, Jeremy, and Felix as they discover something is terribly wrong in the town of Stagtown and attempt to escape the horrors that the residents ignore.\n\nFrom The Heart: Love Me Love Me\n\nJune White moves to Italy for a fresh start after her brother’s death. At her new elite school, she is drawn to James, a dangerous bully involved in clandestine MMA fights, but then begins dating his best friend, Will. That’s the set-up for Love Me Love Me, an Italian YA movie, based on the first novel in the four-book series from Stefania S, and which has notched 23M-plus views. Prime Video has talked up the global appeal of the picture, which starts streaming in early 2026.\n\nDrive Get Into Gear\n\nTamara Lush has been one of Wattpad’s most popular writers for some time and has finally landed her first feature adaptation with her 2022 Wattpad original, Drive. The story follows a young female race-car mechanic who pretends to be engaged to the most scandalous racing star in the scene – officially for his reputation, but secretly to get her own chance behind the wheel. Soon the lie threatens to destroy everything, including what has long since become more than just a game. Amazon has teamed with Bavaria Fiction to adapt the webnovel, which Karsten Guenther is producing, Chris Silber and Malina Nwabuonwor wrote the screenplay, and Sergej Moya is directing. The film is set for a 2026 release.\n\nBad Boy’s Girl On The Starting Grid\n\nSpanish filmmaker Marçal Forés began shooting his latest feature, Bad Boy’s Girl, in early December. The film is adapted from the hugely popular Wattpad novel series of the same name, written by Blair Holde. The movie is a co-production between Italy and Spain with Lotus Production and Diamond Films España on board. The story follows Tessa O’Connell, who has only two goals for senior year: to keep her head down, and to get over the heartbreak of seeing her longtime crush date her ex-best friend.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 00:01:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T02:14:52.999574"}

Very good start here for Anaconda especially in regards to its budget of net $45M (Marty Supreme cost $65M before P&A).\n\nAnaconda‘s social media was propelled by Jack Black’s 48.7M fans along with Selton Melo’s 9.9M, however, Paul Rudd is off the grid. Social media analytics corp RelishMix says, “Convo runs positive for Anaconda when the crowd leans into self-awareness and comedy as the point, not the apology. There’s a clear pocket of viewers clocking the film as a deliberate tonal pivot, closer to Tropic Thunder, Jumanji, or Be Kind Rewind than creature-feature horror. These comments frame the cast as a feature, not a flaw, treating Black and Rudd as genre translators rather than sacred-cow desecrators. Nostalgia works when it’s playful, not reverent, and that’s where enthusiasm clusters. Humor-forward fans applaud the meta energy, soundtrack drops, and Christmas counter-programming angle. ‘Anaconda meets Tropic Thunder!!! I love it!’ and ‘Whoever thought of making Anaconda comedy action genius move!’ anchor this side of the conversation, often comparing it favorably to the original’s camp reputation rather than its scares.”\n\nParamount’s SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants at 3,570 sites is seeing $3.4M in its second Friday, 3-day of $10M, -36%, for a running total of $36.9M.\n\nFocus Features’ Song Sung Blue at 2,587 theaters is seeing $2.6M today, $7.6M for the 3-day and $12M for the 4-day. Rotten Tomatoes audience score is super at 98% certified fresh. Net production cost for the Craig Brewer directed title is $30M. The social media universe for the Kate Hudson and Hugh Jackman movie counts 128M, which is under A Complete Unknown‘s 187.4M. Still, there’s Jackman pushing the pic to his 80.5M followers and Hudson to her 23.1M.\n\nObserves RelishMix: “Convo on Song Sung Blue lands strongest with audiences craving warmth, nostalgia, and communal musical comfort. The positive thread treats this less as prestige cinema and more as a feel-good jukebox experience, repeatedly framing schmaltz as intentional and welcome. Jackman’s musical credibility is defended through comparisons to The Greatest Showman and earlier stage-forward performances, while Neil Diamond’s catalog is viewed as emotional shorthand that does the heavy lifting. Fans lean into sing-along energy, cross-generational memory, and sincerity over subtlety, positioning the film as counter-programming to darker or more ironic releases. The tone here is knowingly corny but emotionally confident. ‘I think we all need a movie like this right now,’ and ‘Cheesy but also brilliant and heartfelt, perfect for Neil Diamond,’ neatly capture the pro argument.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 03:03:17 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T03:41:02.801902"}

A Madea Halloween distributor Lionsgate.\n\nSpiro, who has successfully repped Alec Baldwin, Jay-Z and many an A-lister over the years with a slugger’s approach is certainly putting forth the narrative of how he wants the Jonathan Delshad represented Rodriguez’s LA Superior Court case to go down in flames.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThere is no denying Rodriguez’s suit is very similar in tone and format to the ongoing $260 million seeking sexual harassment and assault suit initially filed in June in LASC by Delshad for his client The Oval actor Derek Dixon against Perry. At the same time, there is no denying also that Rodriguez’s 23-page complaint of December 25 is full of potentially damning text message screen grabs, oral sex remarks and other suggestive conversation from an allegedly predatory Perry. There are also apparent cringey proclamations by the filmmaker of “You know Mario, I’m not a bad person to know and have in your corner.”\n\nFocusing on the making of Boo! and number of subsequent meet-ups, such as a November 14, 2018 Beverly Hills dinner at Mastro’s Steakhouse to discuss more potential roles for model Rodriguez that saw a cameo of sorts from John Cena, the complaint is also full of graphic and specific details. “Mr. Perry reached into Mr. Rodriguez’s underwear and grabbed his penis,” the filing exclaims of an allegedl assault eight years ago. “Mr. Perry was making sexual moaning noises and saying, ‘Stay here, stay here,’ while he pressed his body against Mr. Rodriguez and continued to grab his penis.”\n\nCapping off that alleged incident, the filing claims Perry “stuffed $5,000.00 in Mr. Rodriguez’s pocket” as the slightly inebriated latter was waiting for an Uber to take him home from Perry’s house. Other alleged attempts by Perry to offer Rodriguez financial security and on-screen roles for what the plaintiff understands to be sex followed up to 2024.\n\nClaiming “PTSD …psychological, emotional and economic injuries” from Perry’s alleged actions towards him, Rodriguez (who did play a “very good looking college student” in 2016’s Boo!) and lawyer Delshad have hauled Lionsgate into all this.\n\nLionsgate Bryan Bedder/Getty Images\n\nTheir argument is disarmingly simple, though with an odd misspelling of the studio’s name. “Lions Gate should have known of Perry’s misconduct as Perry has had many such allegations made against him in the past,” the Christmas Day filed complaint states. “But for Lions Gate’s failure to act and enforce their morality clauses and other safeguards, the sexual assaults would not have occurred as Perry would not have been in a position of power.”\n\nLionsgate, as it is actually spelled, did not respond tonight to Deadline’s request for comment on the December 25 lawsuit and their place in it.\n\nNow, in terms of someone who did have the courtesy to respond, Spiro may be swinging in defense of his client, but the NYC-based Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan partner is not all together off the mark with his strong statement this Boxing Day. Rodriguez decided to take action with his claims after a Sean “Diddy” Combs referencing friend texted him on June 18 with news of Dixon’s case.\n\n“Mr. Rodriguez realized that Mr. Perry was continuing to use his power and influence to sexually assault hopeful actors, and, with the voice of others, decided it was time to tell his story, obtain justice, and finally stop Mr. Perry,” this week’s filing says. “When Perry became aware that Rodriguez was going to file this action, Perry once again reached out to Rodriguez by text, telling Rodriguez that Perry did so much to help Rodriguez and was that (sic) Perry was feeling betrayed by Rodriguez,” the document adds.\n\nInterestingly, with all the text exchanges displayed in Rodriguez’s filing, this possibly explosive one is not there to see.\n\nNow, to Spiro’s slamming of Rodriguez via Delshad and the Dixon matter, it is a bit more nuanced in reality. For instance, the case hasn’t actually “failed,” as New Yorker profiled Spiro claims.\n\nDelshad’s case against Perry for Dixon hasn’t exactly nosedived, but it has had an unconventional path through the legal system so far. Filed in LASC in June, the matter was pulled from state court in California and moved to federal court in the Golden State earlier this year. Then Dixon filed to have his case remanded back to LASC. On December 12, a federal judge ruled that Dixon had not proved he had residence out West and denied the return to state court. A consequence of Judge John Walker’s decision was that Dixon’s case was then shifted to federal court in Georgia, Perry’s home base.\n\nSitting with Judge Sarah E. Geraghty out in the Peach State the past two weeks of this holiday season, Dixon’s case hasn’t seen much more movement. Which means, once Lady Justice picks up the pace and assuming there is no settlement, 2026 could very likely see Tyler Perry fighting pricey sexual assault cases on two sides of the country, which could prove very very messy indeed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:12:36 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T06:39:00.596698"}

Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing [&#8230;]", "content": "Ambassador Richard Grenell, the Trump-appointed president of the Kennedy Center, said the organization will seek $1 million in damages from noted jazz musician Chuck Redd after Redd abruptly canceled this year’s Christmas Eve concert in protest of the center’s renaming to “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nIn the letter sent Dec. 26 to Redd, first reported by the AP, Grenell wrote: “Your decision to withdraw at the last moment — explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure — is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution.”\n\n“This is your official notice that we will seek $1 million in damages from you for this political stunt,” Grenell wrote.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn a post on X Saturday night about his legal threat to Redd, Grenell said, “The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts. But we will not let them cancel shows without consequences. The Arts are for everyone — and the Left is mad about it.”\n\nRedd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRedd had led the annual Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center since 2006. On Wednesday, he told the AP that he nixed this year’s event after Trump’s name was added to the organization’s building and website. “When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd said, per the AP.\n\nWorkers on Dec. 19 added Trump’s name to the center, coming one day after the White House claimed that the Kennedy Center board of trustees — handpicked by President Trump — voted unanimously to rename the facility the “Trump Kennedy Center.”\n\nLegal experts say the renaming of the center was illegal, because a 1964 federal law established its name as “the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts” after the slain president and explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from adding any other name to the building’s exterior. On Monday (Dec. 22), U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) sued Trump and the Kennedy Center’s board seeking to force the removal of Trump’s name from the organization, saying an act of Congress is required to change its name.\n\nThe free Dec. 24 concert at the Kennedy Center had been scheduled to take place Tuesday at 12 p.m. at the center’s Millennium Stage. “Join in our annual Christmas Eve Jazz Jam for an evening of music that’ll fill you with holiday cheer,” the cultural center had said in promoting the event.\n\nRedd, 67, is “well known internationally as a performer on drums and vibraphone” and is featured on more than 80 recordings, according to his website. The musician began recording and touring at the age of 21 when he joined the Charlie Byrd Trio. He also became a member of the Great Guitars (Barney Kessel, Byrd and Herb Ellis) and served as artist-in-residence at the Smithsonian Jazz Café in Washington, D.C., from 2004-08. Redd also was a member of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra for 15 years.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 12:49:36 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T12:51:29.937429"}

It’s rarely quiet, and there’s always something dominating the pixels of this website, so we endeavored to take a moment and reflect on some of the stories that have shaped 2025. From Karla Sofía Gascón’s car crash awards campaign, to the gawp-inducing resignation of the BBC’s top brass, and a new birth for James Bond, here’s a rundown of the WTF moments that shook the global film and TV industry.\n\nJanuary\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón attends the 2025 Netflix Oscar party Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images for Netflix\n\nJanuary 2025 will be remembered as the month that wildfires caused devastation in Hollywood, killing 31 people. It was a heartbreaking time for the town, and the fallout was felt far beyond Los Angeles. International stars, including Anthony Hopkins and Eugene Levy, were among the thousands who lost homes in the blaze. Hopkins spoke for many when he said: “The only thing we take with us is the love we give.”\n\nIn the same month, Karla Sofía Gascón’s bid for Oscar glory was dramatically derailed when the Emilia Pérez star’s ugly historical tweets about Muslims and George Floyd were uncovered. She was the front-runner for Best Actress and would have been the first openly trans person to clinch a golden statuette. In the end, she skipped the red carpet and was roasted by host Conan O’Brien. “YOU TWEETED WHAT?” he screamed — words that will have resonated with Netflix’s campaign team.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFebruary\n\n‘Skyfall’\n\nWe were left shaken (and perhaps a little stirred) in February, when Amazon MGM Studios signaled a new era for James Bond. Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli relinquished control of the British super spy in a $1 billion deal with Jeff Bezos’ studio, paving the way for development to begin on Bond 26, four years on from Daniel Craig’s last tour of duty in No Time to Die.\n\nAmazon later announced that Denis Villeneuve would helm the new 007 movie, with David Heyman and Amy Pascal producing. No word yet on who will fill Craig’s shoes, but Villeneuve will begin the search for a fresh-faced Brit once he’s done with Dune: Part Three. As for Broccoli, our Baz Bamigboye revealed the loss of Bond was like a “death in the family.”\n\nFrom a British hunk to a Spanish one: February was also the month for the “Montoya, por favor!” viral sensation on Spain’s version of Temptation Island. Contestant José Carlos Montoya hijacked our social media feeds as he made a desperate charge across a moonlit beach to confront his girlfriend as she slipped between the sheets with another man. It was a moment of pure cinema from one of the world’s top reality shows.\n\nMarch\n\nAdolescence‘ Netflix\n\nAdolescence went from low-key British original on Netflix to globe-straddling giant in March 2025. The story of a British teenager radicalized by the manosphere — told through the prism of four episodes all captured in one shot by a pioneer of the form, Philip Barantini — became Netflix’s second most-watched series of all time. It established Stephen Graham as one of the UK’s finest acting exports, burnished the credentials of prolific writer Jack Thorne, and birthed a breakout star in the shape of Owen Cooper.\n\nAdolescence went on to win eight Emmys and made its way into political conversation in the UK, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a deal with Netflix to stream the series for free in secondary schools. It also marked a peculiar bit of dissonance: while Adolescence was conquering Netflix, British drama producers were wringing their hands about a funding crisis on home soil. Despite Channel 4 accusing Netflix of “TV tourism,” Adolescence showed that, at its best, UK drama is both a commercial and creative force.\n\nApril\n\nRussell Brand\n\nThe White Lotus and Aimee Lou Wood’s teeth (thanks in part to a Saturday Night Live sketch slammed as “mean and unfunny” by the British actress) were the talk of the internet in April, but it was a slower-burning story that caught the eye. Two years after The Sunday Times published allegations that Russell Brand sexually assaulted four women at the height of his fame, the Forgetting Sarah Marshall star was charged with rape, indecent assault, and sexual assault by London’s Metropolitan Police. In December, the Met brought two fresh charges of rape and sexual assault against him.\n\nBrand has reinvented himself as a Christian convert who evangelizes about free speech and free thinking in MAGA America, but he saved UK authorities a potential extradition headache by appearing in court in May. Brand pleaded not guilty and will face trial in June 2026. “I’m now gonna have the opportunity to defend these charges in court, and I’m incredibly grateful for that,” he told his followers.\n\nBrand was not the only British actor to be charged with rape in 2025: Micheal Ward appeared in court over similar allegations. The Top Boy star, who was quickly dropped by UK agency Olivia Bell Management after the charges were announced, had not long returned from Cannes, where he was on the promotion trail for Ari Aster’s Eddington.\n\nMay\n\nDonald Trump Getty\n\nDonald Trump surprised the industry by revealing that he planned to slap 100% tariffs on film imports, describing overseas production as a “national security threat.” He would later say that luring Hollywood shoots away from the U.S. with tax breaks was like taking “candy from a baby.”\n\nOverseas producers heaved a collective groan of disbelief at Trump’s Truth Social pronouncement, with a feeling that the tariffs would be disastrous for countries that have become heavily dependent on U.S. production, not least the UK. Although the tariffs are yet to materialize, Trump has continued to chunter about the film biz in recent months, and history tells us he’s prepared to follow through with threats.\n\nMay was also the month when the new Harry Potter was introduced to the world. Step forward young Scottish actor Dominic McLaughlin, who will star as the titular wizard in HBO’s hugely anticipated TV adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s behemoth. He will be joined by Alastair Stout and Arabella Stanton, who will play Potter’s trusty sidekicks Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively.\n\nHarry Potter casting has been one of the themes of 2025, with others attached including Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid, John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore and Janet McTeer as Professor McGonagall. Filming has been ongoing for months ahead of a 2027 premiere.\n\nJune\n\n(L-R) Netflix’s Greg Peters and TF1’s Rodolphe Belmer at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival Getty Images\n\nJune was the month that Netflix hugged good old-fashioned linear TV, striking a “new kind of partnership” with TF1 to carry the French commercial network and 30,000 hours of its on-demand content. The distribution pact was the equivalent of NBC, or another major American commercial network, handing over its output to Netflix.\n\nAt the time, Deadline noted that the deal was probably “the start of something bigger.” We were right. Just a month later, Disney inked a content-swap agreement with UK network ITV, under which shows like I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! stream on Disney+ and ITV gained access to Star Wars titles like Andor. Disney has since struck similar deals with ZDF and Atresmedia.\n\nElsewhere in June, punk rap band Bob Vylan became a household name in the UK after their performance at Glastonbury Festival. Frontman Bobby Vylan screamed “Death, death to the IDF” on stage, and his words were streamed live by the BBC, causing an almighty stink. It would pile pressure on the BBC’s director general Tim Davie in a way that would take on extra significance later in the year…\n\nJuly\n\nChristopher Nolan Getty Images\n\nOne of the bigger headlines of July was the defenestration of presenter Gregg Wallace from the UK version of MasterChef following a misconduct investigation, but we wanted to focus on a couple of peculiar movie stories.\n\nChristopher Nolan’s The Odyssey is shaping up to be the cinema event of 2026, so it’s no surprise that details from the movie, as well as first-look pictures and trailers, have gone very viral throughout this year. One story from production that raised eyebrows, however, was the backlash against Nolan’s decision to briefly film in Morocco-occupied Western Sahara.\n\nMorocco’s authority over Western Sahara, which is roughly the size of New Zealand, is not recognized by the international community. Nolan’s entry into this sensitive political arena was painful for indigenous Sahrawi people and their supporters. The Western Sahara International Film Festival (FiSahara), which takes place in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria, issued a provocative statement saying that the celebrated British director was fueling “brutal repression.”\n\nJuly also gave us a literary scandal that had ramifications in the film world, when The Observer newspaper alleged that author Raynor Winn gave misleading information about her life story in her beloved book The Salt Path. The novel had only just been the subject of a film starring Gillian Anderson as Winn and Jason Isaacs as her ailing husband, Moth Winn. Winn denied wrongdoing and said the reporting was “grotesquely unfair.” Number 9 Films and Shadowplay Features said they were unaware of the claims at the time of optioning the book.\n\nAugust\n\nKPop Demon Hunters‘ Netflix\n\nAugust was the month when KPop Demon Hunters confirmed its status as a monster hit, with the Sony Pictures Animation becoming Netflix’s most popular movie of all time. The milestone was announced after a sing-along version of the film hit big screens in the U.S., finishing No. 1 at the box office with an estimated $19.2 million. Little wonder then that, in the same month, Netflix started early talks about a sequel.\n\nSeptember\n\nTilly Norwood Xicioa\n\nWhile Jimmy Kimmel was briefly taken off air by ABC in a real-world, dismay-inducing free speech row, the business was equally spooked by an artificial intelligence creation. Introducing Tilly Norwood, an AI “actress” who went massively viral after Deadline reported on the thoughts of her creator, Eline Van der Velden, at the Zurich Summit.\n\nNorwood was a vessel for all the industry’s worst fears about AI replacement, even if UK-based Van der Velden tried to reassure people that Norwood was less a Skynet baddie and more “a piece of art.” She told Zurich that agents were circling Norwood, but a couple of months later, Van der Velden was still being coy about potential representation in an interview with Deadline. Expect Norwood to be back in the headlines in 2026.\n\nOctober\n\nStudioCanal’s Paddington Bear vs the ‘Spitting Image’ puppet StudioCanal/Avalon\n\nPaddington Bear is the genial literary creation that has spawned a movie franchise, a West End stage play, and now, a bizarre legal tussle. Deadline revealed in October that StudioCanal, maker of the Paddington movies, was suing UK producer Avalon for satirizing the marmalade-loving mammal in its iconic puppet sketch show Spitting Image. A YouTube version of the sketch show depicted Paddington as a potty-mouth podcast host with a series titled The Rest is Bulls*!t.\n\nSpitting Image responded to the High Court proceedings by having its version of Paddington wiping his derrière with the legal filing and declaring: “Your writ, my s**t.” Avalon later removed episodes featuring Paddington, but not before The Rest is Bulls*!t was watched by 191 million viewers. Avalon is yet to file its defense, but is expected to make a full-throated case for freedom of expression against the company described by rogue Paddington as “Studio C Anal.”\n\nAnother big, but less surprising story, was Disney’s decision to drop BBC sci-fi series Doctor Who. Deadline spoke with multiple sources in Doctor Who‘s orbit who said the co-production deal fell apart for a variety of reasons, including concerns over the Ncuti Gatwa show’s failure to break out from its established fan base and big-ticket budget. Others suspected that fears of a “woke” backlash may have been a factor.\n\nNovember\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie Getty\n\nA true shocker dominated November, as the BBC became entangled in a ghastly dispute with the most powerful man in the world.\n\nIn case you missed the scandal, Panorama, the BBC current affairs show, clumsily edited Donald Trump’s January 6 speech to make it appear as if the U.S. president had incited violence. BBC executives spent the better part of a year privately defending the edit. The row then exploded into the open when a BBC editorial advisor’s misgivings about the edit were leaked to The Daily Telegraph.\n\nBBC boss Tim Davie dramatically quit on a Sunday evening, as the Trump scandal became the final straw in a tumultuous year. Deborah Turness, the BBC’s news chief, also resigned. Then Trump promised to sue — a threat he made good on in December, taking the BBC to court in Florida, seeking up to $10 billion in damages.\n\nThe BBC believes it can argue strongly that the Panorama film did not harm Trump, but is now in the invidious position of having to make this case in an expensive legal battle. U.S. networks have folded under similar pressure — will the BBC stand strong?\n\nDecember\n\n(L-R) Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, WBD CEO David Zaslav & Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters\n\nThe war for Warner Bros. Discovery reached something of a climax in December, with Netflix apparently winning out. There’s a long way to run on this one, and it’s still unclear how any takeover will shake out for Warner Bros. Discovery’s international operations. Experts say the EU is unlikely to block any deal, but Europe and beyond have echoed Hollywood’s concerns about theatrical windows, licensed content, and the power that will be concentrated in Netflix’s hands after it has already won the premium streaming wars.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 14:01:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T14:23:58.538946"}

The Peacock series follows Alexander Hale (Simu Liu), an intelligence analyst with The Orphanage, an organization that serves as a watchman for the United States intelligence communities. Founded by the clandestine St. George (Kathleen Chalfant) and with Peter Moira (Brian d’Arcy James) at the helm, The Orphanage has never been compromised. When Alexander is promoted to field work, however, things take a shocking, perilous turn. “The Copenhagen Test” has a great deal of potential, but its overly complicated plot, crammed with too many characters, leads nowhere.\n\nThree years after his last in-field mission as a special forces soldier, Alexander feels stunted in his current role at The Orphanage. Though his personal life is looking up — he recently started dating a woman named Michelle (Melissa Barrera) — his career has gone stale. Disillusioned with his position as an analyst, Alexander interviews for a more expansive role in a newly formed operation, putting him and his work rival, Edmond Cobb (Mark O’Brien), in competition.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBut Alexander isn’t exactly honest about his health: He’s secretly suffering from migraines and panic attacks, mitigated only by the pills his ex-fiancée, Dr. Rachel Kasperian (Hannah Cruz), covertly gives him. What’s more, the last three assets he was assigned to track have been exposed, prompting a review of all analysts at the organization.\n\nStill, following the guidance of his mentor, Victor Simonek (Saul Rubine), Alexander lands the promotion. On the heels of that, he discovers his brain has been hacked for months, thus the headaches: A new technology has given the hacker unprecedented access to everything he sees and hears. Horrified that he might be seen as disloyal, he comes clean to Moira, who, along with St. George, decides to use this knowledge to their advantage and smoke out the perpetrator. The pair enlist Samantha Parker (Sinclair Daniel) to act as Alexander’s handler, documenting and anticipating his every mood.\n\nDespite the intriguing premise, “The Copenhagen Test” never fulfills its promise. What should be a gripping thriller centered on new, uncharted technology and questionable loyalties degenerates into a jumbled mess. The eight-episode first season is so overstuffed that audiences likely won’t be able to follow all the threads, which barely come together in the end. From the sprawling cast of characters to the various missions and timelines, there is too much to wade through. Forming a genuine connection to Alexander, or feeling sympathy for him, is a stretch because the character remains wooden, never fully realized. Moreover, when the villain and their motivations are finally revealed, the discovery feels neither revelatory nor meaningful.\n\n“The Copenhagen Test” presents plenty of compelling plot points. In addition to uncovering who hacked Alexander and why, there is also the history of the previously “unhackable” Orphanage, as well as commentary on xenophobia, racism and birthright citizenship and the question of who is “allowed” to be an authentic American. Yet, because creator Thomas and his writers’ room take viewers on such a dull and unwieldy mission, the show loses momentum and interest as it muddles its way to the climax.\n\nUltimately, the Peacock show may have a stellar cast and a solid concept, but the execution falls flat. The pacing is overlong, removing much of the tension and excitement that make thrillers so fascinating to watch. A tighter episode count and a streamlined timeline likely would have improved the series’ structure. However, amid so much other programming in the thriller genre, “The Copenhagen Test” isn’t clever enough to stand out.\n\nAll eight episodes of “The Copenhagen Test” premiere Dec. 27 on Peacock.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 15:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T15:26:08.654006"}

But Safdie was just as obsessed with getting things right, Fisk says — even down to searching for the right size ping pong balls, since balls were slightly smaller in the 1950s than today’s version.\n\n“Josh has got so much energy and is such a lover of New York, and I was always trying to find things that I could tell him that were a little different. But he was ahead of me,” says Fisk.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWorking with the likes Terrence Malick, Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese, Fisk says, “was exciting times — we thought, like, we’re taking over the film business. And so now this was exciting for me, because there’s a whole new wave of young filmmakers that are brilliant,” he says.\n\n“Marty Supreme” takes place over numerous settings, from the atmospheric Lower East Side of 1950s New York, with its street vendors and small shops, to Japan, where the crew prepped and filmed for two weeks.\n\nLocations included New York’s Plaza Hotel and Indonesian Embassy, which stood in for swanky London hotels, and the Woolworth mansion on East 80th Street, where Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin O’Leary’s wealthy characters lived. “I couldn’t believe they let us shoot there. It was over the top,” Fisk recalls. International table tennis tournaments were recreated at Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey.\n\nFisk worked closely with Safdie to envision some of the film’s biggest set pieces, including the table tennis parlor Marty Mauser frequents that is based on Lawrence’s Broadway Table Tennis Club.\n\nChalamet, too, was involved in the production design, Fisk says. “His enthusiasm and his dedication to acting, and what he was doing was inspirational. I’m married to an actress (Fisk is married to Sissy Spacek), so I’m always building sets for the actors to help them, and he just took advantage of all of it. He knew what kind of research we were doing. He would come in all the time and look at drawings and models, and show up at locations. His excitement about the film made you excited to be a part of it.”\n\nFisk details what went into creating some of the film’s most important settings.\n\nLawrence’s Broadway Table Tennis Club\n\nThe Table Tennis Club\n\nWhen Fisk read “The Money Player,” written by Marty Reisman, the 1950s ping pong champ who loosely inspired the story, he realized that Lawrence’s Broadway Table Tennis Club, where Marty hangs out, would be a central location. Though the building no longer exists, Fisk found vintage photos taken by the city.\n\nHe then asked Safdie’s wife, executive producer Sara Rossein, who was working on research for the film, to see if she could find the blueprints. “Not only did she find the blueprints, but she found an article from Look magazine or one of those magazines that had beautiful black and white photos of the place. We were able to see exactly how it was set up,” he says.\n\nThe art department even added the hand-painted landscape murals that were created when the space housed an indoor miniature golf course, though they aren’t very visible in the final cut.\n\nWhy was this level of detail so important?\n\n“You like to start somewhere, and you think that if it’s closer to authenticity, it might help the actors understand their character,” says Fisk. “We start with the most accurate representation we can find, and then we alter it to work for the film.”\n\n“I think in my heart, I approach a lot of these films that I do as documentaries. So research is fun, exciting, and it gives you a starting point,” Fisk says.\n\nJosh Safdie, right, on location at the shoe store. Atsushi Nishijima\n\nThe Shoe Store and 1950s Orchard Street\n\nFisk lived in New York in the early 1960s, so he had a fairly good idea of the right look. In addition, the crew studied N.Y. experimental filmmaker Ken Jacobs’ short film “Orchard Street,” which shows the crowds and streetscape of the Lower East Side neighborhood in color.\n\n“We actually shot Orchard Street on Orchard Street,” Fisk says. “We found a store there that we wanted to make the Northridge shoe store, and right next to it was a brand-new hotel. So we had a problem up and down the street. Everybody had modernized their buildings and put in tall plate glass,” he recalls. Plus, the street signs were different, and there was graffiti everywhere, which wasn’t there in the 1950s. Fisk explains that set designers built a modular system of tenement fronts that covered the ground-level building fronts.\n\n“Then Adam Willis, our decorator, started doing layers from the awnings over these modular fronts to the tables with all the things they were selling, and the storefronts, the windows we kept working on layers right out into the middle of the street. And it started to look very real.”\n\n“The graphic artist created signs for us, and then the scenic artist aged them beautifully, and we used those to hide a lot of the modern signs underneath and anything else that was offensive.”\n\n“It was fun to be on the street at that time, because you could kind of lose yourself and think you’re in the 1950s,” Fisk remembers.\n\nWhile the tenement interiors were shot on a stage, the shoe store was shot in an actual store that was rebuilt because the ceiling was falling down and the floor was unsafe, Fisk recalls. It was important to him to communicate a 1950s feeling through the colors of the interiors.\n\n“Whenever I go into an old place, I start peeling away paint or moving light switches to see what was under it, trying to get back in time,” he says. “We use a lot of colors from the ’50s, because they were just beautiful. Looking at period color charts, there’s very little white, but a lot of really rich colors. In my career, I’ve tried to always bring that color back in and avoid white like the plague. White just seems more contemporary to me, but it also just burns a hole in the film. If you look at white on a piece of celluloid, it’s just clear there’s nothing there.”\n\nThe Japanese table tennis tournament in “Marty Supreme.”\n\nTokyo\n\nIn a climactic scene, Marty heads to Japan for a championship game. Fisk exchanged drawings and photographs with the Japanese art department for a month before the crew traveled to Tokyo, and they had already pulled together most of the graphics.\n\n“We had a plan on how to design the stage where they were going to have the tournament. We just didn’t know which stage it was,” Fisk says. After touring locations, they found a concert shell in a park outside Tokyo. “It was perfect. It was close to the period and it looked like you were in another country. Our crew put together some towers out of bamboo that we then covered with Japanese graphics.”\n\n“We found photographs of some artwork from the World Tournament in Tokyo, just a year or two after our film, and we were able to borrow from that,” says Fisk.\n\nSafdie, who speaks Japanese, was thrilled with how the scene came together, Fisk says. “It was such an easy place to work, and the people were so kind, and the art department was so talented. You would just kind of wish something and it would show up. The ping pong table was based on an old Japanese table. I sent them a picture of it, and next thing I knew, we had one.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T16:31:12.940028"}

However, it was James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” that led the pack for the second weekend in a row.\n\nDisney’s third “Avatar” installment earned $22.6 million domestically on Friday, a roughly 39% decline from last week’s opening day. The film has grossed $46.6 million since Christmas and looks to add a total of $75 million to $80 million domestically by Sunday. Total North American earnings should reach $176 million by the end of the week.\n\nRounding out the top five were two holiday newcomers, including Jack Black and Paul Rudd’s “Anaconda” and Timothée Chalamet’s “Marty Supreme,” as well as holdovers like Disney’s “Zootopia 2” and Paul Feig’s “The Housemaid.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nA24’s “Marty Supreme” took second on Friday with $6.73 million domestically from 2,668 locations. The film has earned $16.2 million since Christmas and is projected gross $30 million by Sunday. Directed by Josh Safdie, Chalamet stars as up-and-coming table tennis phenom Marty “Supreme” Mauser, who claws his way to the top of the sport through fast-talking hubris and explosive skill.\n\n“Marty Supreme” managed to break the top 10 at the domestic box office last week with $875,000 from just six screens. That’s $145,933 per theater, which is the best per-screen-average (PSA) of the year, the highest PSA of all time for A24 and the best PSA for a platform release since 2016’s “La La Land,” according to A24. The early hype is thanks to a stellar promotional campaign led by Chalamet, who channeled a Mauser-esque bravado to make “Marty Supreme” one of the most talked about holiday films in recent memory.\n\n“Zootopia 2” shot up to third place with $6.7 million on Friday after slotting at No. 5 this time last week. Schools are out for the holidays, which is no doubt a contributing factor to the sudden rise of the family-friendly animated caper. The film looks to add $20 million by Sunday, an impressive result considering the film released a month ago. The domestic total should hit $308 million by the end of the week.\n\nSony’s “Anaconda” slithered to fourth place on Friday with $5.4 million domestically. The horror comedy, which follows a group of amateur filmmakers trying to recreate their favorite 1997 film of the same name, earned $9.1 million on Christmas and is expected to gross a hair above $20 million by Sunday. Along with Rudd and Black, the film stars Steve Zahn, Thandiwe Newton, Daniela Melchior and Ice Cube. The rapper starred in the original film and plays himself in the remake for a meta pseudo-reprisal.\n\nThe No. 5 slot went to “The Housemaid,” which grossed $5.2 million on Friday, an uptick from its $3.5 million Christmas Day earnings.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts — named in honor of the former president, who was assassinated — appears to be in violation of a 1964 statute that prohibits the addition of names on memorials to anyone other than JFK. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH), an ex officio board member, filed a lawsuit in federal court Monday seeking a declaration that the name of the arts institution is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and that a board vote last week to change the name is null and void.\n\nThough a renaming of the center may require authorization from Congress, the Trump-led board moved to do so anyway. The Kennedy family deemed the vote an “insult” and “short-sighted action” that is “beyond comprehension.”\n\nNiece Kerry Kennedy wrote, “President Trump and his administration have spent the past year repressing free expression, targeting artists, journalists, and comedians, and erasing the history of Americans whose contributions made our nation better and more just.

President Trump stands in opposition to these values, and his name should not be placed alongside President Kennedy’s.”\n\nEarlier this year, Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center, after he ousted roughly half of the arts organization’s board members who were appointed by Joe Biden.

Girls wear culottes and vintage tees. “They almost look contemporary to us,” Bellizzi says, noting that downtown New York was the epicenter of style, even then. Women weren’t wearing pants in the 1950s but “the girls in the Lower East Side were.”\n\nGetty Images\n\nAtsushi Nishijima\n\nAtsushi Nishijima\n\nThe grotty tenements of the Lower East Side — and the distinct fashion within — is as much of a character in A24’s drama as the eponymous ping pong player himself. In the film, Timothée Chalamet plays the mousy, arrogant and delusionally ambitious Marty Mauser as he hustles for the chance to prove his greatness at a sport that nobody takes seriously.\n\nAuthenticity and historical accuracy is of utmost importance to both Bellizzi and Safdie, who previously worked with each other on “Uncut Gems” and “Good Time.” For production design, this meant using the exact right font on a Delancey storefront. For the costumes, it meant no contemporary brands — anywhere.\n\n“Even down to the underwear!” Bellizzi quips. The women’s tights in the film, for example, were sourced from Williamsburg’s Hasidic Jewish Center.\n\nBut once those markers for historical accuracy were set, it was really about inhabiting the mind of Marty Mauser. “What was he looking at? What were his references? Who did he look up to? Who were the types of people that he saw on a regular basis?” These were the questions that were top of mind for Bellizzi when constructing his wardrobe, she says.\n\nThe hustler subculture was specifically compelling for Bellizzi, who looked to 20th century Wise Guy gangsters to evoke Marty’s gritty swagger. This reference ultimately informed his boxier, oversized suits; tailored two-piece sets with strong, padded shoulders, in dark colors such as deep charcoal and navy blue, became his uniform for much of the film.\n\n\n\n“It’s kind of like dressing for the job you want,” she says. “It’s not even ‘Fake it till you make it,’ it’s just him wanting to show he’s in the know.”\n\nOf course, the real-life table-tennis sensation Marty Reisman, who Chalamet’s Marty is loosely based on, was also on her mood board. “The real Marty was eccentric, so I wanted to give him a little bit of flair and style without being overly stylized,” she says. “He’s pretty classic – it’s more in the shapes and in small details.” One standout fashion moment includes a pair of red leather gloves he wears while shoveling a hot dog down his throat in the middle of a traffic-riddled street.\n\nOf course, it would be remiss to write about the costume design in “Marty Supreme” without mentioning Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow), the retired movie star that Marty is intent on seducing. Kay’s refined style – made up of ivory wool coats, pillbox hats and delicate face veils – is Marty’s aspirational opposite. While we mostly see her in neutral colors, her most striking ensemble is a red, satin evening coat she wears to the opening of her play — and later, to a secret rendezvous with Marty.\n\n“That was her ending when she felt the most alive again, and that’s why we chose red,” Bellizzi says. “This dress is her moment. She’s so excited – this is the party for her big new theatrical show and then we find out it doesn’t do well, it doesn’t get great reviews.”\n\n“This emotional, alive feeling gets destroyed,” she continues. For Bellizzi, this moment comes close to encapsulating the entire point of the film: “Sometimes you have big dreams for yourself, and then sometimes they don’t go the way you want them to.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T17:24:03.027985"}

You don’t know what she’s going to say. There is a moment of suspension.”\n\nYuna could have unloaded on Shane, telling him she is worried about his career and his endorsements. “It could have gone that way, but ultimately, she chooses Shane,” Chang says.\n\nHudson Williams as Shane Hollander, Connor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov, Dylan Walsh as David Hollander and Christina Chang as Yuna Hollander. sabrina lantos\n\nIn fact, Williams recently told me that it was this mother-and-son conversation that was a driving force behind wanting to play Shane. “That scene was the scene that ruined me the most when I read the script,” he said. “It was the scene that I was like, ‘If I don’t get to play Shane Hollander.’ It’s also a scene that’s not in the book, but to me it is the quintessential wrap-up scene to that arc for him and his mom. Period.”\n\n“Heated Rivalry” is from creator Jacob Tierney and is based on Rachel Reid’s gay hockey romance novel series “Game Changers.” Chang read the scripts for the six-episode season after being offered the role of Yuna.\n\n“I was like, ‘Is this soft core porn? What’s happening? It’s hot. What the heck is happening right now? This is amazing. It’s like ‘Fifty Shades of…’ Oh, my God!’” she says, before adding with a laugh, “Thank God it wasn’t me getting naked.”\n\nWhat was it like filming the scene with Hudson? Did it feel heavy?\n\nNot on the day. I think Jacob said in an interview that these boys were so dedicated and so focused. First of all, just the way they were eating and the way that they were maintaining their health and their physique and then on top of that, they had skating lessons. And then, of course, Connor had his Russian lessons, which is a whole other impressive situation. So they were very focused. That said, we always knew how to have a good time and joke around. And though there was a lot of laughter on set because that’s a great outlet for when things are intense, nobody was making jokes while filming the scene. It was the last scene of the day, which I appreciated. I thought, “Well, good. I don’t want to feel like they have to rush to another scene.” When I read the scene, I was emotional, and then ever since then, I have been emotional.\n\nWhat’s your advice to parents who have a child who has come out to them?\n\nYour love for your child and their well-being is the most paramount. Everyone has a different definition of protection, but loving and protecting them means seeing them for who they are and embracing that. If your child has the courage to tell you this, just know that it likely wasn’t easy. So just love them for that, and work through it together.\n\nWhat did you think when you heard that HBO Max acquired the show from [Canadian streamer] Crave?\n\nI was like, ‘Now we have a shot. Now we are going to be seen.’ Didn’t know still how it would be received.\n\nAn NHL spokesperson has said that they welcome any opportunities that bring in new hockey fans. And then the next phenomenon is everyone asking their trainers at the gym how they can get hockey asses.\n\nIsn’t that crazy? Those boys [Williams and Storrie] are the nicest. Obviously, I’m not their mother, and I do like to have a good time with them because I am their friend, but I also feel protective of them.\n\nYou worry about them?\n\nI’m not experiencing [their fame] at all, but I’m watching it, and it’s really weird, and I think it’s weird for them. I’m not worried yet. The conversation online about their own personal lives is kind of an interesting topic. I understand the different perspectives.\n\nWhat are your hopes for Season 2?\n\nThat I get to spend as much time with Hudson and Connor as possible.

They’re, together, fighting Vecna, the malign force that wants to destroy the entire world, but that has been bedeviling Will in particular since the show’s first episode. Back when he was first kidnapped and taken to the Upside Down, Will had been a slight and awkward boy who found himself picked on and scrutinized. Older and somewhat more secure now, Will realizes that Vecna, the evil being, is manipulating his insecurities. He’s trying to prise him away from his friends by showing him a vision of himself as abandoned by his friends and totally alone; in order to make sure that’s just a dark fantasy, Will needs to unburden himself.\n\nIn one of the episode’s final scenes, Will’s words come in a torrent, painfully earnest and meandering until he finally arrives at his point. “The truth is,” he says, “I am different. I just pretended like I wasn’t because I didn’t want to be.” Anyone who’s ever had to give a speech whose substance is like that of Will’s will recognize the halting, awkward cadence here, as well as the manner in which he announces his sexuality: “I don’t like girls.” He can’t quite bring himself to say what he does like, but this, for now, is enough.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThis, a pivotal character opening up about being queer on a show as massive as “Stranger Things,” feels seismic — and, oddly, like the culmination of a very long journey. In the show’s earliest episodes, Will’s mom Joyce (Winona Ryder) says that her son has been cruelly mocked by his own father for being “queer”; back then, Schnapp, the actor playing Will, was a young child. (He’s 21, and an out gay man today.) Throughout the series, Will’s slight isolation from the rest of his peer group has been a note the show’s creators, Matt and Ross Duffer, have struck from time to time. He was singled out as uniquely vulnerable by Vecna, who needed an easily culled outsider to use as a vessel; this connection between Will and a being from another dimension has, this season, given Will magical powers himself.\n\nBeing queer, in other words, is a sort of superpower — and, this season, a boy who previously had stared wistfully out of windows waiting for his life to begin is now actually living it. Among the older-kid cohort of the show’s Hawkins, Indiana is Robin (Maya Hawke), who is somewhat more open about her own desires; she’s a semi-out lesbian whose brashness and ability to be forthright with Will give him no small measure of encouragement. (Will asks her how, exactly, she knew that she was barking up the right tree when she started pursuing her girlfriend; she told him that she knew how to read signals. Gaydar is its own magic power, too, honed with practice!)\n\nAnd this message, that in difference one finds strength and not weakness, sits right at the center of a show watched by many, many kids of all ages. (Numbers may not tell the full story of the “Stranger Things” juggernaut; I recently attended a holiday party at which a passel of middle-schoolers bemoaned the fact that they’d have obligations on Christmas Day, like opening presents, that would keep them from binging the new set of episodes immediately.) There have been harder times, perhaps, to be growing up aware of one’s own difference — like, say, 1987, when “Stranger Things 5” is set — but I wouldn’t wager it’s terribly easy right now. The fact of queerness occupying such a crucial thematic role in the show’s endgame means that many young people may take the idea that their friends will love them for who they really are to heart.\n\nFor, after all, Will isn’t shamed or cast out by his friends; to a one, they hear what he’s saying and affirm their support. (One senses, in some of the performances, that this news does not come as an Earth-shattering shock to a few of the characters.) And then they return to the matter at hand. They need to save the world, so that they all, differences aside, may go on living in it.\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers\n\n• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale\n\n• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Director Shawn Levy on Will’s Huge Breakthrough\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T18:35:44.371289"}

But in Volume 2 of “Stranger Things,” he takes the character a step further into possibly his creepiest yet, a cult-leader-like performance as Mr. WhatsIt.\n\n“Jim Jones was an early reference for me,” Bower says, citing the leader of the cult the Peoples Temple, who in November 1978 led more than 900 of his followers to commit mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana. “He was on the mood board, even with regard to certain things that he’s saying when the kids are all in front of him. There were points where I thought, ‘Do I say the word “you” or do I use the word “we”? We’re a family now.’ That’s really grim! It totally can remove the idea of autonomy, so definitely there had to be that level of cult leader-esqueness about him.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAlthough Mr. WhatsIt doesn’t look as villainous as Vecna, it was just as “terrifying” to take on the different character, says Bower: “There was so much fear in playing that.”\n\nHis approach for Season 5 overall was very different than Season 4, when he was crafting Henry’s memories.\n\n“What you saw in Season 4 happened, and it was real. This is very much like, how nice can I be to these poor children to make them feel as comfortable as possible in this world? And how much of my experience am I burying within that? And it’s always a really terrifying prospect when you’re sat opposite another actor, and your intentions are so deeply buried,” he says. “There’s a level of real dishonesty in that, and that’s really scary. It’s really hard, particularly opposite a child.”\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nWhen Bower first took on the role, he told Variety about the humanity he focused on while playing Vecna. Now, that’s a bit tougher to access, as the character gets worse and worse and kills more and more people — but, Bower says, it’s still there.\n\n“There’s definitely a humanity that I can see,” he says now. “How much of that is portrayed in this volume is open for discussion and interpretation — there’s definitely trauma and experience that is present but unexplored at this point.”\n\nHaving seen the show’s prequel play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” ahead of Season 5, Bower knew that something that happens to Henry at age 8 in a cave had been a “monumental experience” that was “life-altering” — he was never the same after that. Then, he begged the Duffer brothers for more information about Henry’s backstory.\n\n“It was something that I really felt like I had to pry out of Matt and Ross Duffer. They weren’t wildly forthcoming with that, because obviously, they wanted to protect it, but it was important for me to know what that was and why that was the case,” he says. “So, it was just a question of taking with me what I’d learned from the play, and then also just being irritating and asking questions.”\n\nIn Episode 6, as Max (Sadie Sink) and Holly (Nell Fisher) make their way through Henry’s memories, looking for a way out of his mindscape, they come upon what may be the answer to what happened to him. In a mine shaft, young Henry comes upon an injured man holding a silver suitcase, who shoots Henry in his hand in a panic. Holly and Max watch as Henry beats the man to death in self-defense, and start to open the case — but then Max calls Holly away. When asked what’s inside that silver suitcase, Bower has a one-word tease: “reason.”\n\nAs for what he can say about the series finale, which drops on Netflix on Dec. 31? Expect the unexpected. The last scene in Episode 7, “The Bridge,” is Henry and the 12 children he’s kidnapped — most of whom worship him, as with a cult leader — joining hands at the Creel dinner table. He needs them to complete Vecna’s quest to remake the world, presumably replacing the Rightside Up with the Abyss.\n\n“The end of 7 is an incredible setup for what is to come. And if you think you know what is to come at the beginning of 8, you’re probably wrong,” Bower says. “It really does blow the fuck up. Whatever you think you know will be exceeded.”\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers\n\n• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale\n\n• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Why Will’s Coming Out is Seismic\n\n• Director Shawn Levy on Will’s Huge Breakthrough\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 21:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T21:41:51.669063"}

And so, I think there was that. I really appreciated Thomas’ take on this 5 minutes into the future, set in this world of intelligence.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nLiu added, “And then on the other hand, it was the cultural specificity. I really was struck by Alexander’s backstory in the script and feeling like he was somebody who, in a fully three dimensional way, kind of embodied what it was like for someone from an immigrant family to be in a situation or to work in a situation, an environment where they’re constantly being second-guessed, constantly being overlooked and underestimated.

It feels like Michelle and Alexander are in their own reality TV show about finding love, because they’re playing out this romance,” he joked. “And of course, they know the cameras are on, so there’s a part of them that knows that they’re playing it up. … It’s a lot of layers to get to play, and she’s a great scene partner.”\n\nRead on about Simu Liu’s The Copenhagen Test character, the show’s scary real-world parallels and his fight scene with Melissa Barrera.\n\nDEADLINE: What about the project drew you in?\n\nSIMU LIU: I think on the one hand, it was definitely the premise and the world building, just dealing with themes of surveillance and technology. I feel like a lot of those things are really just topical and relevant today. And so, I think there was that. I really appreciated Thomas’ take on this 5 minutes into the future, set in this world of intelligence. And just getting to play a super spy, I think is something that I’ve always wanted to do. And then on the other hand, it was the cultural specificity. I really was struck by Alexander’s backstory in the script and feeling like he was somebody who, in a fully three dimensional way, kind of embodied what it was like for someone from an immigrant family to be in a situation or to work in a situation, an environment where they’re constantly being second-guessed, constantly being overlooked and underestimated. I think, for myself, it’s something that a lot of people who grew up in those immigrant families, something that I think resonates a lot. And so, even though it’s through this terrible hack that happens to him, it’s watching him get to kind of come into his own, watching him get the opportunity to prove himself, everything that he’s capable of. It just was really rewarding to read on the page, and I thought Thomas Brandon did a fantastic job writing the pilot, and when him and James first approached me with it, I was just really sold.\n\nMelissa Barrera as Michelle and Simu Liu as Alexander in ‘The Copenhagen Test’ Christos Kalohoridis/Peacock\n\nDEADLINE: I definitely noticed that kind of element of American nationalism. It was very an interesting perspective on that topic, and also on surveillance. It made me paranoid like watching it. Did it like give you ideas, like, “Oh my God, this is where things are headed”?\n\nLIU: I mean, it’s less of “this is where things are headed” and more like, “no, this is where we’re already at,” except instead of being hacked against our will, we do it voluntarily, give our information. And we voluntarily keep these recording devices with us and are on it hours and hours and hours a day, and we’re just feeding it data about all of our behaviors and our interests and literally everything. So, it got me really thinking about that, and it made me really want to put my phone away. it was funny, Melissa and I were comparing our screen time apps earlier today, and I don’t know if she told you what her daily average screen time is, but it is astounding, and I don’t think mine is low either by any means. I’m like desperately trying to get that number lower, but I think we both looked at each other and we’re like, “This has gotta change.”\n\nDEADLINE: And I loved the romantic comedy within the spy thriller between the two of you, even though she’s manipulating you the whole time. What was it like balancing that dynamic with her?\n\nLIU: I loved it. To have someone like Melissa to play opposite of, it’s just such a privilege. One of the first things that I realized about her was that she worked in a really similar way as I did. I think there’s actors that come to set, they do their job, and as long as the cameras are rolling, we’re best friends. And then, cut, everyone goes home, and that’s it. But, for me, and I think for Melissa, I think a lot of what we believe is that the on-screen rapport is informed by the off-screen rapport, and so really just invested a lot of time with each other to get to know each other, to get to know how we work. And I really appreciated just how down she was and how much she pushed herself. As much as I realize it’s rare for someone like me to be in a lead position, I feel like she feels the same. And both of us come from immigrant families, from different visible minority communities. And so, we were just like, “Wow, first of all, it’s so incredible that we’re here. Let’s do everything we can to make this the best experience ever, and to do the best we possibly can.”\n\nDEADLINE: I thought it was kind of wild of them to just have sex, knowing that they’re being watched by multiple people, but I thought that was a funny element to their whole up and down.\n\nLIU: Yeah, I told her, it almost feels like being on Love Island. It feels like Michelle and Alexander are in their own reality TV show about finding love, because they’re playing out this romance. And of course, they know the cameras are on, so there’s a part of them that knows that they’re playing it up. But of course, if that’s all it was, I don’t think that would be compelling for an audience to watch. There has to be an element of the audience has to believe that part of that is real, and I think if they do, and if you believe that it’s real, then you believe that there’s a part of both of their characters that really wants it. And whether or not it’s for somebody else, it’s also a little bit for them as well. It’s a lot of layers to get to play, and she’s a great scene partner.\n\nSimu Liu as Alexander in ‘The Copenhagen Test’ Christos Kalohoridis/Peacock\n\nDEADLINE: I also thought your fight scene with Melissa was incredible. It was really fun to watch. Do you have a favorite fight scene or a favorite moment from any of the fights that you filmed on the show?\n\nLIU: I really loved our fight with each other in episode 7. I loved just everything coming to a head with their relationship, and it’s like, finally, maybe for the first time, this is who they really are, each of them. So, I love that so much of Michelle and Alexander is meeting each other for the first time, and then meeting each other for the first time in the basement of the bookstore, and then meeting each other again for the first time, when kind of all bets are off, and it’s just like one has to kill the other. After the whole season and after all the training that she had been through, Melissa was looking really sharp as a fighter, and so, she came to set and she was just ready to come to blows. And it was really fun just to get to to play that with her, and I’m really proud of what we did too. I’m really proud of her. She did a lot, most, if not all of her own stunts, and she’s just the best, a spectacular action star in the making.\n\nDEADLINE: It must have been easy for you with the Shang-Chi experience and all of that.\n\nLIU: It’s weirdly my bread and butter. When I see choreographer or I see stunt people on set, there is weirdly a part of me that feels at ease because I’m like, “Oh, I’m about to go into my flow state.” And for whatever reason, the fight scenes, and the choreography, and the lines, and the rhythm, it all just kind of makes sense to me. It’s almost like a second nature, and I really love doing it. I wish I could do it more. But maybe in a season two, who knows?\n\nSimu Liu as Alexander Hale in ‘The Copenhagen Test’ Christos Kalohoridis/Peacock\n\nDEADLINE: I hope there’s a season 2. The last episode, we find out not only his ex-fiancée was in on this, but also his mentor, and I’m wondering, do you think that he can trust anyone going forward after everything he’s been through?\n\nLIU: Yeah, there’s a lot of trust [issues]. After reading the last script and seeing the few cuts, as they were coming through, I was joking with Thomas and [co-showrunner Jennifer Yale], just like, “This guy’s gonna need so much therapy because he’s been betrayed so many times just in the span of just these few weeks.” It’s a really rough time, but also, what I appreciate about his character at the end of the first season is that he’s at a point where he is no longer looking to others to figure out what to do. He’s not looking to others to give him a sense of belonging. He is very much trusting in himself and his own moral compass, and realizing, “At some point, I have to stop caring what other people think. I’ve spent so long trying to fit in and trying to belong, and now it’s time for me to really just step out and do what I need to do.” And I think if we get the chance to continue his story, I think it’ll be really, really exciting seeing where he takes that.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 21:59:42 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T22:24:32.526520"}

So tell me what about the whole privacy element kind of intrigued you and made you wanna create the story.\n\nJAMES WAN: Can I just ask you guys this? The whole time, obviously I’m thinking in my head, how does he go shower? Does he look down when he goes to the bathroom?\n\nTHOMAS BRANDON: We had a shower scene. It was at the end of the pilot, and it was kind of indicative of him accepting the mission. He’s getting undressed to go in the shower … and then he just looks down. And it was kind of a little too funny for the end of the pilot, but it what it spoke to was this larger thematic [element] of your question, which is, here’s a guy who is now in his effort to prove to his country, “I can be trusted.” They’re like, “Great, give us your entire life. Be a double agent in your life, sacrifice your family, your friends, your loved ones, your body, everything.” And he’s like, “OK” and he’s doing it to prove it. And the journey of the show is asking, “Should I be doing this?” What is the line of how much you give to your country, when you’ve lost a part of yourself? And that was one of the things that we were really looking at for the privacy aspect of it all. And the other thing we did stylistically was, a lot of times in the spy genre, there’s heavy use of shadows. Very noir-ish, the shafts of light, and what’s creepy is the things you can’t see. What we decided in our show is what would be creepy is the things you see but you don’t understand. So, that’s why we really see a lot of the architecture in our show. You see a lot of the things around Alexander, and he’s looking at these things, but the paranoia comes not from what I can’t see. The paranoia comes from what I can’t understand. And so, what we did is we made sure the camera really stayed with Alexander on him over his shoulder from his point of view, so you could see the workings of this Truman Show office and not know who’s in on it and who’s not, and that was part of what we were driving to do.\n\nDEADLINE: It’s funny you mentioned that because that’s literally what I was thinking during the sex scene. I’m like, they know multiple people are watching this, right?\n\nJENNIFER YALE: That’s why she says, “Are you sure?” And she turns off the light.\n\nBRANDON: And those were some of the longest conversations we had in the writing room. It brings up some weird consent issues.\n\nMelissa Barrera as Michelle and Simu Liu as Alexander in ‘The Copenhagen Test’ Christos Kalohoridis/Peacock\n\nDEADLINE: On that note, I also love kind of the romantic comedy within the spy thriller, even though you soon figure out she’s just manipulating him, which is even more fun to watch. But tell me about balancing their chemistry with her manipulations.\n\nYALE: I mean, we had a lot of fun, and this was also in the same conversations about, how do you have sex without them listening and watching. But we took a lot of time to make sure that we built up their chemistry before you find out that she’s manipulating him, because you want to want them to get together and to have that love affair. And so, that was why we took a lot of time to show you part of a scene, and then the audience is with Alexander. experiencing the scene, only to have the floor drop out when you realize that this is all a script.\n\nBRANDON: Yeah, and that’s really fun in the second episode to unravel a lot of the intentional tropes we leaned into the first episode, which is like, you’re down on your luck and there’s a helpful sweet bartender who, this time it’s real. This time, she’s really attracted to you. And you start to realize like, oh, these are all the story that Parker is telling. She’s using these forms of these characters we think we’ve seen before, because she’s essentially creating this television show around him, and it worked on him. And part of the fun for him is realizing, “Yes, this worked, but I’ve understood that I’m still in The Truman Show.” And so him starting to begin to fight back and ultimately him telling the story back to the rest of them, where they’re not sure what he’s about to do.\n\nWAN: Thee romantic comedic aspect also reminded me of things like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, just the interplay between the two of them, and it actually goes even further back to like your classic Hitchcock, just the really old-school sort of caper mystery between the two characters. And there’s always this tension between two, but there’s also a lot of romantic tension as well. And I think you guys did a great job pulling that into this modern setting.\n\nDEADLINE: Michelle hints at her past, that she’s done something very bad and that’s why she’s here, and then by the end, Parker burns her file. She gets that fresh start. But I was curious, had you come up with a backstory for her that you told Melissa or something to keep in the back of her head?\n\nYALE: Yes, that was one of the big things that we did with each one of the characters is, we had a backstory that each one of the teasers gave you a little bit more about each one of the characters and where they came from and where they were going. And we had shot a teaser that was Michelle, but we wanted to wait, because we thought it gave the audience too much information. And we do want to keep where she went at the end of Episode 8, and this idea that she wants to go home or have a life different, outside of this world. Is that really where she went? Or is she undercover still? Is she still in the game?\n\nSimu Liu as Alexander in ‘The Copenhagen Test’ Christos Kalohoridis/Peacock\n\nBRANDON: Yeah, and part of the kind of Russian nesting doll of Michelle is the fact that you never know if you’re getting the real her. And so, even though we kind of have built a backstory, the question is, is that real? Or is that the backstory that’s in a file somewhere, that is not the actual real story. Because to us, the most interesting aspect of Michelle is not, “Oh, what’s the truth here?” The most interesting aspect is, is there someone who’s played so many roles that she’s forgotten what the truth actually is? Has she really lost sight of who that person actually was? And could you ever separate out what’s real and what’s not?\n\nYALE: And then playing with her relationship with Parker, and what she wants out of that relationship, and is that genuine in, the chemistry that they have and the friendship that they have, or did she just want Parker to burn her file?\n\nDEADLINE: And that was another character I’m really intrigued by, Parker, just cause she relates to Hale so much or she understands him so much. And I’m wondering if that’s because they’re similar or because it’s her job, and she’s just very good at thinking ahead of everyone?\n\nBRANDON: Yeah, that’s a great question. We wrestle with that a lot. I think there has to be some similarity. One, she is great at her job, and she’s great at figuring out—she is kind of the stand-in for the writer in the show, which it is my job to put myself in this person’s shoes and understand them, whether they’re like me or not. But there is a unique special power she has, which we hinted at the end of the second episode, when she has found his seven words and her words are similar. They’re not exactly the same, but she understands what’s driving him, because they have a similar drive, she’s able to imagine what is he about to do next. And like you, we love the character and thought Sinclair was fantastic in this, what could be a very dry person who stands and looks at a lot of monitors, and she brought such energy and empathy to that. And in the midst of a show that has a lot of action and intrigue and thought-provoking twists and turns, what we really liked is she gave us a chance for a kind of—they told me not to use this word because it’s too arcane—but Cyrano de Bergerac. It is a very unrequited love, right? She’s kind of slowly falling in love with her own creation. Through Michelle, she is romancing Alexander, and she has this parasocial relationship with him. Like all of us watching TV, we know that character infinitely and that character does not know us. And then, watching how the real life starts to fuse into her little hermetically sealed world she’s in was fascinating.\n\nMelissa Barrera as Michelle in ‘The Copenhagen Test’\n\nDEADLINE: Back to Michelle, I liked where that story went and how it teases the potential for a second season. So, I am curious if there are plans for that, but I’m also curious—because St. George’s love story was so heartbreaking and beautiful, and there’s all this backstory from how The Orphanage started—I’m curious if you have thought about doing some kind of prequel series or something.\n\nYALE: Ooh, Peacock!\n\nBRANDON: Yes. There’s been a thought there, but it’s just thoughts. But yeah, it was always designed as an ongoing series, so there’s plans and ideas and hopes for what a second season could be.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 02:01:40 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T02:25:44.306366"}

The pair then keeps up the façade of a blossoming romance, with both seemingly developing real feelings, despite neither fully trusting the other.\n\nAs Michelle, Barrera was left nearly as in the dark as the audience about the character’s mysterious backstory, which is never quite revealed amid multiple layers of lies and deceit.\n\nMelissa Barrera as Michelle and Simu Liu as Alexander in ‘The Copenhagen Test’ Peacock\n\n“So, for me, I’m a very controlling, planning kind of person as an actor,” she added. “I kind of had to let go and be like, ‘You know what? I’m not going to know, because they’re still writing and I don’t know where they’re going to take her.’ And that was exciting in a way and anxiety-inducing in another way. But I think in the end, it helped with the mystery of it all.”\n\nStarring opposite Liu, Barrera had “the most fun” during their fight scene, which she describes as having “very Mr. & Mrs. Smith vibes.” Meanwhile, the Shang-Chi star praised her as “a spectacular action star in the making.”\n\nTwo years after Barrera was unceremoniously fired from the Scream franchise, the actress is grateful for the fans who continue to support her work and “in their way, kind of lift me up,” following a recent Scream 7 boycott in her honor.\n\nMelissa Barrera as Michelle in ‘The Copenhagen Test’\n\nRead on about Melissa Barrera’s complex The Copenhagen Test character, her hopes for Season 2 and her reaction to the Scream 7 boycott.\n\nDEADLINE: One thing I love about Copenhagen Test is there’s kind of a rom-com element within the spy thriller. Was that a fun line to walk?\n\nMELISSA BARRERA: I am always drawn to romance. That is my favorite thing. No matter the genre, I always kind of look for the love story. And so, I thought that it was so cool that there was that element in this show, particularly, and that I got to be a part of it, because I would have gotten FOMO if it wasn’t my character involved. But I do love the performance within the performance within the performance of that dynamic and that you don’t really know how much of that connection is real and how much of that is performance on either side. And so, I think as an audience member, those that are drawn to the relationship will always be kind of rooting for them, for that to be real. But you won’t really know what the thing is because that’s the thing of the show, every episode you kind of get a new piece of information and it takes the rug out from under you.\n\nDEADLINE: Yeah, I definitely gasped a few times while watching it.\n\nBARRERA: Love that. Love to hear.\n\nDEADLINE: And what was it like playing Michelle, who obviously has such a complicated past? It’s just so fun to watch her seem so sincere in one moment and then, the next—\n\nBARRERA: I mean, I’m an actor, right, so it felt like a big part of her job. And that’s why I love that beat where we go back to the first episode and you get to see it from her perspective, where she’s preparing to go out and pretend to be this damsel in distress. And she’s asking questions about who is she, who’s her scene partner, basically, because she is basically an actor in a different setting. She has to prep in the same way that us doing movies and TV would, and really commit to a character for a lot longer than someone that is just acting on set would have to. But I found it kind of easy to think about it in that way. So, I wasn’t stressing out about all the information that I didn’t have, because we started shooting the show, and I didn’t have all the scripts, so I didn’t know where they were going to take her. And it was an interesting challenge, and unlike anything else that I’ve ever done, where I’m having to give in a little bit and trust that the prep that I’m doing and the levels of these versions of the character that I’m portraying will pan out, even though I don’t know where they’re going. So, for me, I’m a very controlling, planning kind of person as an actor. I kind of had to let go and be like, “You know what? I’m not going to know, because they’re still writing and I don’t know where they’re going to take her.” And that was exciting in a way and anxiety-inducing in another way. But I think in the end, it helped with the mystery of it all. And sometimes, I was like, “I’m going to play this a few different ways and you guys are going to use the take that you feel will be best for whatever comes next because I don’t know where you’re taking me.” So, it was kind of like an interesting experiment.\n\nMelissa Barrera as Michelle and Simu Liu as Alexander in ‘The Copenhagen Test’ Christos Kalohoridis/Peacock\n\nDEADLINE: And I really appreciated how you never really discover what happened in Michelle’s past, and then at the end, Parker burns the file. So, I’m wondering if you and Thomas discussed her backstory, or is it something you kind of filled in in your head.\n\nBARRERA: I filled it in in my head. I had an idea of what I needed it to be for me to be able to play that moment of relief, and what she’s running away from, because for her to accept this mission where she knows that if she becomes visible and recognizable by the enemy, that means that she can’t work anymore. The enemy will know who she is, and she decides to take on the mission anyway. So, I’m like, what could make a person take on that mission? What happened? And so I had to fill in that storyline, but I hope that I get a Season 2, so that we can learn more about her and see more of what her life is and what she ran towards or ran away from. It’s an exciting character for me in a very different way than other characters have been. Like when I was doing Vida, I was excited to return to a character because I loved playing with her and I had fun, but here I’m excited to return to Michelle when we get a Season 2 because I was always surprised by where they took her, and so, it’s exciting to play something like that.\n\nDEADLINE: Well, I definitely hope there’s a Season 2, especially after that little teaser at the end of her being a “loose end,” but I also love the dynamic between Michelle and Parker. I felt like they’re just girls bonding over gaslighting boys, and it’s my favorite.\n\nBARRERA: Yes, there’s a level of innocence and unexpectedness to that friendship. And I love that pairing because it feels very high school. It feels like, even though they’re in such a high-stakes situation, girls are girls, women are women, and like the existential crises that we go through are kind of always the same since we’re teenagers. And I think that it’s really sweet that Michelle becomes Parker’s friend. The way that I played those scenes with Parker, I tried to keep it always in truth, obviously, but keep it ambiguous enough to where you could believe that she’s being honest and that she’s letting herself be vulnerable and let Parker in, like it’s actually a genuine relationship. But if tomorrow, the writers decide that in Season 2, it was all fake and she actually never—it wouldn’t surprise me if she was also playing Parker. That could also work. So, it was finding that fine line in the performance of, it could go either way. And if you watch it back with new information later, you’ll believe it. That was the challenge.\n\nDEADLINE: There are quite a few fight scenes in here, and I just have to say you’re such a badass, watching you. What was your favorite fight scene to film, or do you have a most memorable fight moment?\n\nBARRERA: The most fun that I had on set was doing the physical fights. I think I was very much looking forward to that final fight with Simu, just us in his apartment, because it was very Mr. & Mrs. Smith vibes, and I would have loved if it was like five times as long. I could have just kept going, ’cause he’s such a fun scene partner to have, not only in acting scenes, but in physical scenes. He’s so good. Obviously, he’s an action star, right? So, he’s got it down, and I had to do a lot of training and a lot of practicing, a lot of rehearsals to get to the point where I didn’t have to think about the fighting and think about what comes next, and I could focus on the storytelling. And we had an incredible stunt team that was very patient with me. I asked for a million extra sessions on my days off, and they would always be available to me. I just wanted Michelle to really look like she’s been in this life for a while, and she knows what she’s doing, and there’s a reason that she keeps getting paired on these important missions where she is trusted to protect this person or take him down, and I love physical stuff. I loved it. And so, that was a fun day on set, because we got to move through the whole apartment. I would have loved it if we like destroyed the whole thing, but you know, I think we still had scenes to shoot in different order, so we couldn’t really do that. I proposed it, but maybe next season.\n\nMelissa Barrera as Michelle and Simu Liu as Alexander in ‘The Copenhagen Test’\n\nDEADLINE: Separately, the trailer for Scream 7 came out recently and a lot of people have even started a boycott. How does it feel to have these loyal fans after the last two years?\n\nBARRERA: Obviously, having support always feels great, and I’m so grateful for the love that I’ve been shown, and for the support and the new people that have come into my life, and that are now supporting the other things that I’m doing and that are trying to, I think in their way, kind of lift me up. So, that honestly feels really nice.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:13:09 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T02:25:45.735327"}

Her costume features a dramatic black gown with exposed shoulders and striking sleeve design, presenting a character whose refined appearance masks darker undertones. The funereal location and subdued color palette hint at a figure whose influence derives from composure and sophistication rather than explicit aggression.\n\nQureshi has built a formidable reputation across film and streaming platforms through acclaimed performances in Anurag Kashyap’s crime drama “Gangs of Wasseypur,” the black comedy “Dedh Ishqiya,” and revenge thriller “Badlapur.” Her work in streaming series includes the dystopian Netflix drama “Leila” and the SonyLIV political thriller “Maharani,” for which she received a Filmfare OTT Award. She was most recently in Season 3 of Netflix series “Delhi Crime” and the lead in Bikas Ranjan Mishra’s film “Bayaan,” which bowed at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\n“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n“Casting for this role was perhaps the trickiest,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “The character demanded a performer with high octane caliber and an undeniable presence. From the moment Huma entered my frame, I witnessed that she possessed something rare. She carried an effortless sophistication and intensity that immediately brought the character of Elizabeth alive for me. Huma is an actor who questions, probes, and challenges the artistic interpretation of a role and that dialogue became an essential part of our creative journey. She has always been known as a powerhouse of talent, but this performance will mark as a turning point for the arrival of an undeniable, commanding new presence on celluloid.”\n\nThe first look at Kiara Advani‘s character Nadia was unveiled recently.\n\nThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\nProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T05:30:42.781479"}

The story traces the female lead’s journey through family tragedy and her eventual pursuit of justice through her art.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn the film, produced by Irfan Khan for EBG Films, Chohan will portray Rani, a character whose arc spans from her teenage years to middle age across four distinct life phases. The role requires extensive martial arts training, including Chilambattam, a traditional Tamil stick-fighting technique.\n\n“Rani is a young woman who spends her formative years immersed in devotion, singing hymns to God in temples,” Pillai tells Variety. “Beginning with the vibrancy and innocence of her twenties, her life unfolds across four distinct phases, tracing her journey from youth to middle age. To authentically portray this evolution, the actress taking on the role must master martial arts, including Chilambattam. As the narrative moves through different eras, the character undergoes significant physical and emotional transformations, requiring the actress to adapt her appearance and presence accordingly.”\n\nThe director says that casting Chohan was “entirely serendipitous.” “From our very first conversation, I was struck by her deep passion and dedication to her craft,” he says. “When I shared the story of Allirani, she showed a genuine and immediate interest. The character of Rani is a powerful and resilient woman, whose journey spans from her teenage years to middle age. The role also demands extensive martial arts sequences, a challenge Sheena is exceptionally well suited for, given her many years of training and experience in martial arts.”\n\nFor Chohan, the role aligns with her longstanding commitment to socially grounded material. “I did so much theatre and acting training, that it’s a waste to do a flat character,” she tells Variety. “Also, if you have your acting skills sharpened, you can, and should, give what appears to be a one-note character more depth – of course the most important thing is to be a blank page for your director and give them what they want for the story, but no real people are shallow and morally simple, so I don’t like any of my characters to be.”\n\nChohan, who serves as United for Human Rights South Asia Ambassador, adds that her human rights advocacy has directly influenced her project choices. “I turn down so many films because of derogatory or degrading roles,” she says. “But the good news is that the industry is changing – with all of the good work of women like the Women’s Collective in Kerala, and women and men across the country and world pushing against discrimination – new characters and stories are being written which show women as equal citizens – real-life, breathing, thinking humans, not just pretty Christmas tree decorations.”\n\nChohan’s recent work includes Aditya Om’s “Sant Tukaram,” in which she portrayed Avali Jijabai opposite the title character in the Hindi biopic. The film was widely described as showcasing her quiet power and emotional depth. She describes her performance approach as rooted in thorough character research and technique developed during intensive training at The Acting Center in Los Angeles while working on the Hollywood film “Nomad.”\n\n“What I learned was how to develop a character in terms of understanding their inner thoughts and motivations overall and in each scene,” she says. “So, while I read and watched everything connected to Avali Jijabai, including having the original 17th century historical texts read to me and working and eating with the village women who still work the fields Avali worked in, I then used all of that gathered information to truly understand and fit into her character, so that my reactions were natural.”\n\nReflecting on her Hindi debut, Chohan notes the significance of seeing the film play across theaters in Mumbai, where she is based. “After doing five years of theater, training in my craft, martial arts and dance in Kolkata, I shifted to Mumbai keeping it as a base but working pan India in different languages with legendary directors nationally and internationally,” she says. “But living in Mumbai, it was deeply special to see ‘Sant Tukaram’ playing across theatres here and release nationwide. Having friends and colleagues join me at the Mumbai – national premiere did feel like an arrival. But creatively, it was never a reset – it was a continuation.”\n\nThe actor has also completed J.D. Chakravarthy’s pan-India thriller “Jatasya Maranam Dhruvam,” in which she plays a police officer. “I literally followed a policewoman around into her dangerous job, in her home life – I did so much to get into the head-space of that character, and that too in such a dark, complex thriller, that I can only feel what I brought to the character gave the director an insight that he was desperate for,” she says.\n\nHer upcoming slate includes the VFX-heavy streaming series “Bhaayava,” in which she portrays Lilith. The platform has not yet been locked as the production team completes extensive visual effects work. “I went from playing the wife of a saint, to a devil, and perhaps that’s what made me take the role – it was so different – I went from the most simple scenes in fields where we’ve worked in saris for a thousand years, to being flung out of a car in a harness for a flying scene after five hours of prosthetics in front of one of the biggest green screens in Mumbai,” she says. “However, again, the character was so rich – Lilith was Adam’s first wife in the bible – she was banished from Eden for refusing to be dominated by and obey every word from Adam – so that was a character I had to sink my teeth into.”\n\nChohan’s international credits include “Ant Story” (2013) directed by Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, which played at the Shanghai and Dubai International Film Festivals. She has also appeared alongside Madhuri Dixit in Netflix series “The Fame Game” (2022) and Kajol in JioHotstar show “The Trial” (2023).\n\nHer career began with a debut opposite Mammootty in the Malayalam-language film “The Train” (2011), directed by Jayaraj. Reflecting on her work with renowned actors including Mammootty, Dixit and Kajol, Chohan notes how different directors have shaped her approach. “Acting in India has changed a lot since I was launched by Mammootty – what my director Jayaraj wanted in terms of restraint on the set of ‘The Train’ was quite opposite to what Suparn Varma wanted on the set of ‘The Trial,'” she says. “For Jayaraj I was much more expressive but for Suparn I had to keep it subtle and do so much character research to get into her mind and be my character, without ‘acting.’ What I learned from these legends in terms of command and screen presence in many ways tie in with professionalism – they are really there, doing what they’re doing while they’re doing it.”\n\nOn balancing wider reach through big platforms versus roles that leave a lasting cultural impact, Chohan says, “What I care most about is character and story, so that’s what matters most, but of course, a rich, nuanced character in a well-told, original, larger-than-life, rooted story, that reaches the whole world – that’s the dream – and I want to live the dream.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:05:48 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T05:30:43.121084"}

She was 91.\n\nBardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals, who confirmed the news to The Associated Press. No cause of death was provided, and arrangements for funeral or memorial services have not yet been announced. She had been hospitalized last month.\n\nIn the 1950s Bardot ignited an international zeal for boldly sexual European movies, often directed by her first husband, Roger Vadim, such as “And God Created Woman.”\n\nThough Bardot’s reign as a major box office draw was relatively brief, and she retired from films in the early ’70s, her influence was far-reaching: She made youthful, pouty, nubile blondes a staple in cinema, particularly in American movies, as opposed to a more mature, womanly blonde like Marilyn Monroe. Between Bardot and Audrey Hepburn, the rage for youth in female sexuality became entrenched in movies — and all media — and has never subsided.\n\nBardot (and Vadim) also opened the door on sexuality, for which foreign films became famous in the uptight America of the ’50s. This boldness of approach (if not of substance) would eventually catch on in the U.S. and other countries and signal an end to decades of censorship. By then Bardot had tried to cross over and attain the mantle of a serious actress with such films as Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt,” but met with only limited success.\n\nHer breakthrough came with “And God Created Woman,” written and directed by Vadim and released in late 1956 while her marriage to him was breaking up. The movie was only modestly successful in France but it took off overseas, earning $8.5 million around the world. New and older films by Bardot such as “Mam’zelle Pigalle,” “Please! Mr. Balzac” and “The Girl in the Bikini” (from 1952) all washed up on U.S. shores, solidifying Bardot as a sex goddess. In France she climbed to the top of the box office with films like “The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful,” “La Parisienne,” which brought out her lighter side; “The Night Heaven Fell,” “The Woman and the Puppet” and “In Case of Emergency.”\n\nIn 1959, Simone de Beauvoir wrote a treatise called “Brigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome.” But by then, Bardot’s girlish sensuality was so well entrenched in the culture that it was not about to be dislodged by serious studies.\n\nAlready the country’s highest-paid film performer, Bardot tried to further prove herself an actress in “Babette Goes to War,” as a member of the French Resistance; Louis Malle’s “A Very Private Affair” and Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “La Verite” in 1960. She continued to work for Vadim during this period, long after he’d moved on to other actresses and she to her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.\n\nGodard’s “Contempt,” in 1963, exploited her reputation and brilliantly commented on it. She also appeared in American-made films such as “Dear Brigitte” (in a cameo), about an 8-year-old who desperately wants to meet Bardot; and “Viva Maria,” directed by Malle in English and pairing her with Jeanne Moreau (Bardot received a BAFTA Award nomination for best foreign actress). Later in the ’60s she appeared in the Western “Shalako” with Sean Connery.\n\nBardot’s last two films, both made in 1973, were Nina Companeez’s “The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot” and the sad “Ms. Don Juan,” another pallid Vadim attempt to exploit her sexuality. The latter was released in the U.S. in 1976.\n\nShe was born Camille Javal to an upper-middle-class Parisian family. Early on she evidenced talent as a dancer, studying ballet and attended the Hattemer’s private school and then the Paris Conservatory. At age 15, at the recommendation of a friend, she modeled for the cover of Elle magazine, where she was seen by director Marc Allegret, who was looking for a new face for his film “The Laurels Are Cut.”\n\nThough she didn’t get the part, Allegret’s assistant, Vadim, took her under his wing and got her small roles in small films before marrying her in a much publicized 1952 event that helped promote the young would-be actress. More small roles followed in films, the first of which to be released in the U.S. was Anatole Litvak’s “An Act of Love” (1953), which starred Kirk Douglas but was shot in France. She then appeared in Allegret’s film “Future Stars” and got her first lead in a chapter of the English Doctor series, “Doctor at Sea.” She next worked with legendary French director Rene Clair in “The Grand Maneuver” (1956) before starring in “And God Created Woman.”\n\nIn addition to her film work, Bardot also recorded some 80 songs, some quite popular, mostly in the 1960s and ’70s.\n\nShe did not, however, work in movies again, and in 2010 the former actress expressed outrage over rumors that an American-made biopic about her was in the works.\n\nBardot would nevertheless remain a media star, in part because of her numerous love affairs, advocacy for animals and zeal for right-wing politics. In 1986 she created the Brigitte Bardot Foundation. Her efforts in the service of animal rights brought her the French Legion of Honor (she refused it), and Bardot was not unwilling to protest or even be arrested to protect four-legged creatures. But she also drew fines imposed by French courts for inciting racial hatred after repeatedly making controversial remarks in which she criticized immigration to France and Muslims in particular.\n\nBardot was married to German playboy Gunter Sachs in the late 1960s, and she married wealthy industrial Bernard d’Ormale, a supporter of the far right in France, in 1993.\n\nBardot is survived by d’Ormale; a son from her marriage to Charrier; and two granddaughters.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:56:30 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T11:22:10.070838"}

Meanwhile a trio of new holiday releases, A24’s sports dramedy “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical tear-jerker “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s action comedy “Anaconda,” helped keep multiplexes bustling… but they weren’t enough to fend off the Disney animated sequel “Zootopia 2,” which returned to No. 2 in its fifth weekend of release.\n\n“Avatar 3” added a solid $64 million over the traditional weekend and $88 million since the Christmas holiday on Thursday. The three-day figure is a scant 28% decline from its $89 million domestic debut, a stronger hold than its predecessor, 2022’s “The Way of Water,” which dropped by 52% after a larger $134 million debut. So far, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” has generated $217.7 million in North America and $760 million worldwide after two weekends of release. Based on past precedent, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” should stick around at the top of box office charts well into the new year. After all the first two “Avatar” films were No. 1 for seven consecutive weekends, eventually earning well over $2 billion each.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Marty Supreme” enjoyed the best debut among newcomers in third place with $17.4 million from 2,600 theaters over the weekend and $27.1 million through the four-day holiday frame. Domestic ticket sales stand at $28.3 million after a weekend in limited release. The three-day figure marks the second-biggest opening weekend to date for A24, the beloved indie behind “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Hereditary” and “Lady Bird.” Alex Garland’s “Civil War” remains the studio’s best debut with $25 million over the traditional three-day weekend.\n\nFor “Marty Supreme,” the stellar start can be attributed to director Josh Safdie for making a movie that’s resonating with audiences, as well as star Timothée Chalamet, who plays a fictional tennis table champ and has been a one-man marketing machine, going to great lengths — and heights — to get out the word about the original film. A24 spent roughly $70 million to produce “Marty Supreme,” which is expected to remain a box office draw due to positive reviews and great word-of-mouth. Moviegoers — roughly 65% of whom were 35 or younger — gave the R-rated film a “B+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls. That’s a far better reception than the “C+” grade that was bestowed upon Safdie’s prior film, the deeply unsettling “Uncut Gems.”\n\n“Sports dramas are not big movies to begin with, but the right cast can elevate them, says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. He’s referring to films like “F1: The Movie,” starring Brad Pitt, and “Air,” led by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. “Timothée Chalamet is making that kind of difference.”\n\n“Anaconda” landed at No. 5 with $14.6 million over the weekend and $23.7 million since Christmas. A $45 million-budgeted meta-reboot, “Anaconda” stars Jack Black and Paul Rudd as best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie, 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down. Critics and audiences were mixed on “Anaconda,” which has a 51% Rotten Tomatoes average and “B” grade on CinemaScore.\n\n“Song Sung Blue” opened in eighth place with $7.6 million over the weekend and $12 million through the four-day holiday frame. Craig Brewer directed the $30 million-budgeted movie, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band. Opening weekend crowds dug the film, which earned an “A” grade on CinemaScore, the best marks among the new releases. In terms of ticket buyers, 65% were female while 53% of audiences were above the age of 55.\n\n“This is a crowd-pleaser, and word-of-mouth should build now among older moviegoers, who take their time getting to the cinema,” Gross says.\n\nMeanwhile Disney’s animated juggernaut “Zootopia 2” outpaced the newcomers with $20 million over the weekend and $25.2 million since Christmas on Thursday. Since its debut around Thanksgiving, the PG film has generated $320 million domestically and $1.42 billion globally, making “Zootopia 2” the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year.\n\nAnother holdover, Lionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid,” notched the No. 4 spot with $15.4 million over the weekend and $18.9 million through the four-day holiday period. The film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has earned an impressive $46.6 million domestically and $64.9 million worldwide to date.\n\nMore to come…", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:03:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T16:34:52.004707"}

That shouldn’t be a problem, since “Avatar” films have become synonymous with box office staying power, meaning the visual spectacles are known to stick around in theaters.\n\nDisney’s other juggernaut, “Zootopia 2,” remained a box office force with $67.2 million from 52 overseas territories and $87.9 million globally in its fifth weekend of release.

To bring that authenticity to the performance, Safdie didn’t just put Chalamet in prop glasses; he went one step further.\n\nSpeaking in front of a packed audience earlier this month at a Hollywood panel, Safdie said, “At the time, we said, we were going to put +10 contact lenses in your eyes, and we’re gonna put -10 prescription lenses in front of them so that when his glasses fall off, he can’t see shit.” When Chalamet tried on that combination, Safdie recalled receiving a call from the actor. “He calls me, and he says, ‘I’ve got the +10s in right now, I’m pretty dizzy.’”\n\nAccording to Safdie, Chalamet described it as feeling like “he was in a fishbowl.” But Chalamet was determined. Safdie said Chalamet told him, “I’ll do anything you ask me to do.”\n\nProsthetics artist Michael Fontaine applied pockmarks, freckles and nicks to Chalamet’s face. “You felt that with the scars and nicks, he’s been in fights, and he’s from the street,” Safdie said.\n\nThe makeup was so convincing that even co-star Paltrow believed it was real. Paltrow plays faded movie star Kay Stone, who is wooed by Marty. She admitted, “I had no idea.” She went on to say, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, he’s got little acne scars,’ and was like, ‘I’m so surprised by how you never see that.’”\n\nWith Fontaine’s prosthetics and the glasses, and his hair in the 1950s style, Safdie says, “When he had them in, he was Marty.”\n\nChalamet also strived for authenticity in his performance and spent years preparing for the role. He took every opportunity to play table tennis because he wanted to appear like a professional player when shooting began. He also trained with table tennis expert Diego Schaaf to help coordinate and choreograph the games.\n\nIn the film, Marty faces off against Koto Endo, who is played by real-life table tennis champion Koto Kawaguchi. He loses to him during a tournament in London, then finds himself face-to-face with him during a match in Japan.\n\nAsked about playing against Kawaguchi, Chalamet said the pressure was “huge.” But he also needed to get it right and felt “a responsibility to that community and to the aficionados and people that are passionate about that sport.”\n\nSafdie added that during filming, Chalamet “would be so in character, he’s like, ‘I want to win the next points. We have to play.'” Kawaguchi was game. “At one point he said to me, it’s like, you know, I’m not an actor, you know, I’m a table tennis player.

From the film’s outset, it is clear that the 82-year-old comedian had zero editorial control over the project.\n\nA minute into the CNN doc, Zenovich (“Lance,” “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind”) can be heard off camera saying to Chase, “I’m just trying to figure you out.”\n\nHis response: “No shit. It’s not going to be easy for you.”\n\n“Why is it not going to be easy?” Zenovich asks.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“You’re not bright enough,” Chase deadpans. “How’s that?” Then the comedian grins.\n\nZenovich says that while she was taken aback by Chase’s response, she was also relieved.\n\n“I’d never done an interview where someone was so rude to me,” Zenovich tells Variety. “But I was so worried going into that first interview with him about how I was going to say to him, like, ‘Everyone thinks you’re an asshole.’ I thought if I did, he would throw me out of his house. So the minute he said that to me, I had a way in.”\n\nThe doc, premiering Jan. 1 on CNN, charts Chase’s rise from breakout “Saturday Night Live” to leading man, his three marriages, his addiction to cocaine and alcohol, heart failure that led to a coma, childhood abuse, depression, a failed talk show, and the star’s various on-set disputes with actors like Terry Sweeney and the entire cast of the NBC comedy “Community.”\n\n“I wanted to figure out who was the real person behind the conflicted, guarded and somewhat fragile man we see on camera,” Zenovich says. “What was behind the surface of his slightly intimidating superstar bravado? Was there any self-awareness there? Having interviewed Chevy at length, I have to say that yes, it’s all there – and a whole lot of pain and heartache too.”\n\nIn addition to Chase and his family, the doc includes revealing interviews with the star’s former collaborators and confidants, including Mike Ovitz, Dan Aykroyd, Beverly D’Angelo, Goldie Hawn, Lorne Michaels, Ryan Reynolds and Martin Short.\n\nVariety spoke with Zenovich and her husband, and long-time producing partner P.G. Morgan, about why Chase decided to make the doc and getting someone, anyone, from “Community” to give an interview.\n\nYou have worked together on quite a few docs about celebrities, including “Lance,” about Lance Armstrong, “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic,” “Jerry Brown: The Disrupter,” and “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired.” Where does Chevy Chase rate on the difficulty meter?\n\nZenovich: When I first sat down with Lance Armstrong, he was sitting at the edge of a seat and ready to spar with me. That is exciting because you don’t know what you’re going get. Then I did Jerry Brown, whom I tried to do that wit,h but he had no interest whatsoever. So, each person is different. Chevy was willing to go there, but he would stop himself. He wouldn’t go all the way. The interviews with him were very hard.\n\nMorgan: There were a lot of unknowns going into the interviews. Chevy is incredibly quick-witted and always on, so you have to be able to go toe-to-toe with him. He’s a bit intimidating as well, and we had a lot of stuff that we wanted to talk to him about – the good stuff and the touchy stuff.\n\nWhen it comes to celebrity documentaries, the celebrity is usually promoting something like a tour, a fashion line or a book. Chase wasn’t promoting anything. Why do you think he wanted to make this film, which isn’t exactly a flattering portrait of him?\n\nZenovich: Someone wrote a book about him, and I don’t think that [Chase’s] family liked it. I think they were trying to right a wrong. I don’t know if they think that they did because it has been hard. [The doc] was a hard watch for him and his family, but I think in the end they appreciate it.\n\nMorgan: I’m guessing that they felt as a family that he wasn’t getting his due. That there’s been a whole run of these documentaries about other people from his generation. I think it hurt that he hadn’t had the same recognition.\n\nDo you think that the people who said no to interviews, like Steve Martin and Christopher Guest, were really saying, ‘We don’t like the guy’?\n\nZenovich: I can’t answer for them, but I think that the absences speak for themselves. Whether it’s scheduling, personal, or saving it for their own doc. In the end, I think we got the right mix of people. I was initially disappointed that we didn’t get more people from “Community,” but there are things people don’t want to talk about.\n\nHow hard was it to get anyone from “Community” to sit down with you?\n\nEvery single person said no. I ran into (“Community” creator) Dan Harmon at a screening of “Deaf President Now!” and I got his number. I was so excited. I thought it was going to happen but then he declined. I was so lucky to get Jay Chandrasekhar (“Community” director). He has such an amazing delivery and he was willing to go there. If Jay had said no, I would have been screwed.\n\n“I’m Chevy Chase, and You’re Not” premieres Thursday, Jan. 1, on CNN.

Sure, it ends with a romantic proposal, but was any fan mentally prepared for that first scene? Let’s just say the room service waitress wasn’t the only person who almost ran away screaming! Brace yourself as we walk through this week’s episode.\n\nOh man, it begins with Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) farting and showing an unblurred shot of his, um, lil’ landman? Holy moly!\n\nWhat a chaotic opening! Tommy didn’t even know he was traumatizing the hotel employee (Ana Ming Bostwick-Singer).\n\nTommy, could you maybe roll over or cover up more for this conversation? It’s distracting that you’re at full-mast.\n\n“Don’t you fuck my omelet!” Am I hallucinating this episode?\n\nThanks for that last shot of a fully erect Tommy.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty horny episode of “Landman” from the jump!\n\nRebecca (Kayla Wallace) is so gaga over Charlie (Guy Burnet)! It’s shocking to see her lovey-dovey facial expressions.\n\n“We’re eating breakfast on the ocean floor.” It’s helpful that he’s a hunk, but Charlie’s monologue about the geology of the area really sings because of Taylor Sheridan’s writing.\n\n“Wildcatting” seems too stressful as a non-gambler.\n\nOoh, spotting a metaphor! Just as she’s “wildcatting” finding oil, Rebecca is “wildcatting” by opening up her heart to Charlie!\n\nSo wait, Tommy did have sex with an omelet to make Angela (Ali Larter) mad?

(Sam Elliott) peeing on a snake? Sure, why not!\n\nGood advice from T.L. to Tommy over lunch. Tommy is annoyed all the time anyway … why not stop and smell the roses on occasion?\n\nI’m convinced Angela and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) are gaslighting Cooper (Jacob Lofland) that he smells, and he actually doesn’t. They say it so often that something strange is at play.\n\nHow did Nate (Colm Feore) possibly guess that Rebecca and Charlie are hooking up? The name thing is not enough — does he have a miraculous sixth sense?\n\nNow we’re discussing cock rings? Gah, this episode!\n\nWas anyone else legitimately scared that T.L. died during the car trip?\n\nPulling on a man’s mustache is dirty business, Tommy.\n\nOh, Lord, what is actually happening at these “man camps”?\n\n“The whole place is a workplace violation.” Good call, Tommy.\n\n“You can eat it or fuck it, I don’t really care.” Ah, Angela, never change.\n\nAww, Tommy is taking T.L.’s advice and appreciating his family. Love to see it!\n\nWhere did Cooper get a zillion candles for this proposal? It’s a fire hazard.\n\nAll said, the proposal was pretty cute.

Donald Trump, his donor and friend Larry Ellison, and son-in-law Jared Kushner are key players.\n\nNetflix’s headline-grabbing $82 billion pact for Warner Bros‘ studios and streaming assets toplines deals announced in 2025. Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Kushner’s investment firm Affinity Partners are taking video game giant Electronic Arts private for $55 billion. Broadband behemoth Charter Communications is buying Cox for $34.5 billion. The nation’s biggest broadcaster Nexstar inked a deal to acquire smaller rival Tegna for $6.2 billion. The latter deal requires a loosening of rules prohibiting broadcast owners from owning TV stations reaching more than 39% of the national television audience. All need approval by the Trump administration.\n\nComcast cable spinoff Versant Media will start trading in days and WBD plans to separate Discovery Global networks from Warner Bros in third quarter of 2026 amid the decline of linear television.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDisney rounded out 2025 with a milestone $1 billion investment in Sora parent OpenAI, breaking bread with the behemoth that’s been ripping off its IP. Industry pundits expect more of those deals.\n\n“Resistance is futile,” says one industry insider, recalling the famous Star Trek line. “That became clear for the music industry 25 years ago with online distribution. Eventually we legalized it by making it accessible. And the same is going to be true, is true, for AI.”\n\n“For the scraping and the training part, I feel like that ship has left. How do you go back when all the models have already done all the illegal sh*t that they shouldn’t have done, and untrain them? Now it really is going to be a focus on output. And that’s important because with Sora, for example, you tell it, ‘Create something like Star Wars characters for me,’ and it will, and that’s infringement, clearly. It’s just a question of how Disney is going to get compensated for that. These AI companies have the money to make deals and they should make deals with IP owners. They should do it legally. They should do it above board.”\n\n“We’re starting to see people that may have always been on opposite sides of the table talk to each other and play together, and play well in the sandbox, to see what’s … possible,” says Bart Spiegel, Partner, Media & Entertainment at PwC US.\n\nOne deal did not make it. Venu Sports, a planned venture of Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney, fell apart. But Disney speedily announced and closed an acquisition of Fubo, which it merged with Hulu + Live TV. Fox launched new streaming service Fox One. Disney debuted its flagship ESPN streamer.\n\nPwC’s recently published US Deals 2026 Outlook noted a major uptick in media and telecom transaction volume and value over the past six months “characterized by headline-grabbing megadeals, increased consolidation within streaming, and a pronounced shift toward profitability and scale — underscoring a renewed confidence among both strategic and financial buyers in deploying capital.”\n\n“A lot of trends came to a head this year,” Spiegel says.\n\nCEOs and fund managers across sectors had, in fact, back in the fall of 2024, anticipated a flood of deals this year if Trump emerged as president on a tide of deregulation. But POTUS himself choked deal flow by unleashing intense tariff chaos in the first part of the year. “We were expecting it to be the year of just a ridiculous amount of M&A,” says one Wall Streeter. “But there was a lot of volatility in the system, and uncertainty in the markets.”\n\nThen the dust settled, although average tariffs – taxes on imports – are still hovering at about 16.8%, the highest they’ve been since 1935, according to The Budget Lab at Yale.\n\nHigh Hollywood Drama\n\nAnd even as M&A across sectors accelerated this summer and fall, media deals appeared to be in the hot seat, as many had predicted.\n\nPresident Trump often disparages mainstream news outlets and has sued CNN, ABC, CBS, the New York Times and the BBC, among others. He frequently threatens to pull broadcast licenses if he dislikes coverage. Brendan Carr, whom Trump named to lead the FCC, approved Paramount’s long-gestating merger with Skydance only after the CBS parent settled its lawsuit for $16 million. “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,” Carr said in a statement along with the commission greenlight.\n\nSo, as the next momentous deal takes shape around Warner Bros Discovery, it wasn’t a surprise exactly when Trump said, “I’ll be involved in that decision too.”\n\nWBD earlier this month inked the deal with Netflix after spurning a half dozen bids from Paramount Skydance including a hostile takeover offer by the Ellison-backed studio. CEO David Ellison and his father Larry with partner RedBird Capital are offering $30 a share in cash for the entire company and insist it has a clearer path to regulatory approval. The Netflix deal is for $27.75 for the studio and streaming businesses, made up of $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock. Both sides have been wooing Trump.\n\n(L-R) Netflix-co-CEO Ted Sarandos, WBD CEO David Zaslav and Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters Warner Bros\n\n“The race is neck and neck right now,” says analyst Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. He thinks “Paramount will get it because they need it more.”\n\nNetflix “is evidently serious. But Paramount has an imperative to get bigger. They need to matter more to consumers.”\n\n“It’s a ‘nice-to-have’ for Netflix because it will give them control over more IP,” agrees Seaport Research Partners analyst David Joyce. “It’s more of a must-have for Paramount Skydance because they do need more scale.”\n\nHe and others think Paramount has a good shot at derailing Netflix if it raises its bid. WBD has said it’s considering Par’s latest offer, which included a new $40 billion+ financing guarantee by Larry Ellison personally, but did not add more cash. Outside funders include Public Investment Fund (Saudi Arabia), L’imad Holding Company PJSC (Abu Dhabi) and Qatar Investment Authority. Kushner’s Affinity Partners was initially part of the group but dropped out.\n\n“We’re waiting for the Warner Bros board to officially opine on their offer … but they didn’t increase the value of their bid. I think that they do need to do that,” Joyce says. Paramount’s offer values Discovery Global assets at $1 a share. “I think it’s worth more like $3.50 to $4 per share. So I think Paramount Skydance will come back with a higher offer. And that will be a way for Netflix to exit gracefully.” He doesn’t expect the giant streamer to counter a higher bid from Paramount.\n\n“Studios and streamer and network companies are in reinvention mode. Have been for several years,” Joyce recalls. “In streaming, you had this transition from land-grab mode, which was kind of from when Disney bought [21st Century] Fox [in 2018], up until 2022, when Netflix stock fell 80% and all the streamers decided they had to get profitable.” Netflix shares plunged in 2022 as it reported the first subscriber losses in over a decade. It marked and end to the era of streamers spending massively to gain share in an increasingly competitive market.\n\n“Over the last two years, you were transitioning out of that land-grab mode into a focus on efficiency. And part of efficiency was increasing prices and cutting costs, and part of it is merging with other companies. And so we see Warner Bros deciding to spin off Discovery. And then Skydance taking over Paramount, and making a hostile bid for Warner. And Netflix taking a shot at Warner Bros. Comcast spinning off Versant is kind of the opposite of consolidation. It’s de-consolidation. But it’s an important acknowledgment that these companies all want to focus their capital on getting stronger in the areas that matter to the future.”\n\nTikTok & The Free Radicals\n\nIn other pending deals, a consortium of investors including Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and the United Arab Emirates’ state-backed investment firm MGX look set to take about 80% of a new American version of TikTok.

The future of TikTok in the U.S. has been an ongoing legal and strategic muddle.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Chew told staff the U.S. JV transaction is set to close January 22.

NBCUniversal’s Peacock is still making losses, and Apple TV’s economics are impossible to disentangle from its trillion-dollar parent company’s, but nevertheless the year in general will go down as a milestone.\n\nWith that long-sought economic maturity has come greater scrutiny of the balance sheet. Although it sometimes feels like streaming is the only arena that counts, a recent report from Morgan Stanley media analysts noted that spending on linear TV remains about double that on streaming. Gone are the days of the firehose of content; even the sector leader, Netflix, has held the line on content expenses of late.\n\nIn 2026, Morgan Stanley predicts, “streaming market repair” will be a key phrase across the sector, as “corporate spin-offs and continued cord-cutting are rapidly shrinking legacy TV as an investment factor.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nStreaming remained a headline-grabber this year even before a game-changing deal centering on the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (with Netflix and Paramount both in hot pursuit as of this writing) was finalized. Disney launched a beefed up new ESPN app, which blends linear feeds from more than a dozen of its networks with a range of streaming-only fare. Fox Corp., for similar strategic reasons, launched a similar flagship, Fox One.\n\nWhile profits and losses are probably the ultimate measure of success, the metrics of streaming underwent a rethink this year, with Netflix and Disney announcing plans to phase out quarterly reports of subscriber numbers. Revenue per user, engagement and other metrics are now en vogue, though success or failure in streaming, as ever, is subject to interpretation.\n\nBelow, in alphabetical order, are the top streaming players and Deadline’s view about how they fared in 2025 as well as what they’re facing next year. This is intended as a comprehensive look at these services – programming, product and overall status in the field, not just value as M&A chess pieces.\n\nHBO Max\n\n2025 Highlight: Becoming the belle of the ball. While HBO Max had gradually earned a place among the top handful of services since its problematic launch in 2020, that slog was supercharged by the acquisition interest by Netflix and Paramount. While either company taking over would mean more upheaval for a company that has cycled through three owners in a decade, for the streaming business the injection of resources will be dramatic – at least until Netflix merges it out of existence.\n\n2025 Lowlight: The rebranding fiasco of Max going back to HBO Max. While Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max Content, did his best to own the mistake when revealing the revamp at the company’s upfront presentation last May, it still belongs in the corporate annals next to New Coke and Qwikster.\n\nChallenge for 2026: Now that it has finally made it to long-forbidden territories like the UK, Germany and Italy (which were unavailable due to a Sky output deal), what can HBO Max make of it? Netflix has become Netflix by incubating global hits from non-U.S. territories. HBO Max should lean into its prestige reputation and take a page from that playbook.\n\nBiggest question for 2026: Can movies throw around more weight? As solid a hit as Superman and other releases were in theaters during Warner Bros.’ best year in ages (not to mention Materialists and other A24 releases making their debuts on HBO Max), they made minimal waves in streaming. With Harry Potter set to rekindle interest in the film franchise with a series take due in 2027, the clout of movies could be HBO Max’s not-so-secret weapon.\n\nNetflix\n\n2025 Highlight: K-pop Demon Hunters. The roaring success of Sony’s animated musical, which landed at the streaming giant under the companies’ pay-1 output deal, gave Netflix something it has been craving: a bona fide franchise. Riding a tide of pop-culture goodwill, a sing-along version of the movie raked in $19.2 million last fall, topping the weekend box office charts. The film also just recently surpassed 500M views on Netflix.\n\n2025 Lowlight: Yet another video game course-correction. Co-CEO Greg Peters, who has overseen the games effort since it began in earnest in 2022, has not tried to put lipstick on a pig. But this year saw the latest strategic shift away from pricey franchise plays and toward casual games suited to the living room. Last fall, Peters made the news personally at an L.A. conference that an adaptation of the board game Boggle was joining the lineup. While the overall business had a banner year, that damp squib of an announcement seemed to sum up the entire gaming misadventure.\n\nChallenge for 2026: How can management keep the troops focused as they pursue Warner Bros.? At $82.7 billion, the deal would be exponentially larger than any prior M&A transaction in the company’s nearly three-decade history. The most important task for Peters, Ted Sarandos and other top execs is keeping the industry-leading operation humming.\n\nBiggest question for 2026: Will the movie portfolio undergo any more changes under film chairman Dan Lin? The producer and former Warner exec was installed in mid-2024, so his fingerprints may not yet be evident on a recent slate marked by Frankenstein, Electric State, A House of Dynamite, Jay Kelly, and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Lin’s best-known credits include The Lego Movie, It, and other properties with profiles that stand out from Netflix’s recent output.\n\nParamount+\n\n2025 Highlight: Taylor Sheridan, aka Paramount’s golden goose, kept filling the basket. New seasons of Landman, Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown clicked with viewers, as did MobLand, which wasn’t created by Sheridan but was exec produced by his close collaborator, David Glasser. Despite the upheaval of the merger with Skydance, which closed in August and entailed thousands of layoffs, the content kept flowing.\n\n2025 Lowlight: Losing Taylor Sheridan. With more than three years left on his overall deal with Paramount, the Yellowstone creator announced he would segue to NBCUniversal in 2029. Of course, there is spin on both sides, especially with high-priced talent deals under a microscope across the industry. But the notion that newly minted CEO David Ellison spent time courting Sheridan and came up empty didn’t send the ideal signal to the troops.\n\nChallenge for 2026: Ordering off the menu. While Sheridan’s world, South Park, the UFC, CBS programming (including the NFL) and Paramount movies are continuing to be marquee draws for the streaming service, it needs to break new ground if it’s going to muscle its way into the top echelon. Should the WBD quest or other M&A deals bear fruit, they would be a quick route to scale. Regardless, Netflix alum Cindy Holland and her troops will need to come up with an equivalent to Orange is the New Black or the many other follow-ups to House of Cards she presided over in her old job. Those originals positioned Netflix as not just intriguing but essential.\n\nBiggest question for 2026: Will David Ellison’s long-promised tech overhaul of Paramount+, with or without the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, bear fruit in the new year? Since the media business set off on the expensive path of chasing Netflix nearly a decade ago, it has made a number of investments that were billed as pixie dust capable of transforming them into true tech giants. AI is the latest element said to confer such power. Technology is ever-present in the ecosystem, so the fact that it exists isn’t new. The main question facing Ellison & Co. is: How will they use it?\n\nDisney+\n\n2025 Highlight: ESPN’s streaming service finally has something to offer. For years, Disney’s sports streaming efforts were hindered by fragmented rights that made it nearly impossible to watch consequential games on its ESPN+ app, but the Mouse House finally upped its game in 2025. After acquiring NFL Network/RedZone, ESPN launched a brand new comprehensive streaming service in August that offered not only every Monday Night Football matchup across both ESPN and ABC this season but a ton of other streaming-exclusive games as well. The WWE also began offering premium live events on ESPN’s app as well.\n\n2025 Lowlight: Although it wasn’t exclusively related to streaming, Disney’s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air while facing pressure from the Trump administration was a lowlight for democracy and may have had a negative effect on public perception of the company across the board. Campaigns circulated online encouraging Disney+ and Hulu subscribers to ditch their plans. Independent data reports have estimated millions of Americans canceled their subscriptions in that aftermath, though the economic fallout is hard to quantify. Disney is about to stop reporting streaming subscriber numbers in quarterly earnings reports, so the full impact of that backlash may not be known, since only a portion of those effects were documented in the company’s Q4 earnings. Regardless, it was yet another year of controversy for Disney.\n\nChallenge for 2026: Stay in consumers’ good graces. This year was as tumultuous as ever for Disney, and 2026 looks to present its own challenges as the company looks to dip its toes further into user-generated AI content. That ventures could go either way, as consumer sentiment specifically around AI is constantly shifting, but any rollout will surely spark backlash from the creative community. The one thing that is clear is that Disney could benefit from a little less turbulence with consumers in 2026, so it should proceed with caution.\n\nBiggest question for 2026: Disney isn’t the only company to tease AI-generated content might soon be available on its streaming platforms, but it certainly has the biggest IP to work from in that regard. After inking a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, how might Disney’s AI ambitions intersect with its streaming offerings in 2026?\n\nApple TV\n\n2025 Highlight: Severance. The show returned for its second season this year and quickly became both a critical and cultural darling. It earned 27 Emmy nominations and won eight, including Outstanding Lead Actress for Britt Lower and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Tramell Tillman. The streamer is also closing out the year on a high note with Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus, which is already shaping up to be a strong awards contender after earning Rhea Seehorn a Golden Globe nomination. It would be wrong not to acknowledge that F1 scored Apple’s biggest ever box office opening this year, too.\n\n2025 Lowlight: The streaming era has brought about many conundrums, and one that it appears has confounded multiple media companies is what the heck to call their service. While not nearly as egregious as the HBO Max debacle, Apple TV quietly rebranded earlier this year too, removing the “+” sign due to apparent confusion it caused. The problem? It only created more confusion, given that Apple TV is also the name of the streaming hardware it sells, as well as the name of the app within the device.\n\nChallenge for 2026: Eddy Cue, Senior Vice President of Services at Apple, admitted in October that the streamer has experienced a few setbacks that have left it “a little further behind than where I’d like to be.” While he pushed back on claims that the service’s subscriber numbers sit around 45M, arguing that it is “significantly more than that,” the point remains that Apple seems to still be small potatoes in the streaming world despite some heavyweight content. The streamer’s financials are pretty impossible to disentangle from its trillion-dollar parent company’s, but it seems to have a ways to go before it’s in the big leagues.\n\nBiggest question for 2026: What is the tech giant’s next move in streaming? As all the chess pieces are moving rapidly across the board, Apple is a peculiar one that seems to have removed itself from the whims of the streaming wars. Apple TV remains the only premium streaming service without an ad tier. The company is also decidedly not joining the furor over Warner Bros. So, it begs the question, will Apple make any big moves next year, or quietly stick to what works?\n\nPeacock\n\n2025 Highlight: Peacock had a lot riding on Season 7 of Love Island USA after the reality show finally took off last year, and, boy, did it deliver. The season broke every viewership record it possibly could, becoming Peacock’s most-watched original season ever with 18B minutes viewed throughout the two months it aired this summer. For better or worse, the show was everywhere, and so were its contestants. Notable wins on the scripted front: The Paper and All Her Fault both performed quite well. The Office spinoff was renewed before the episodes even hit the streamer, and All Her Fault topped the Luminate weekly TV rankings in the week it premiered. It was the first time that a Peacock original series had been No. 1 since the Luminate rankings were introduced.\n\n2025 Lowlight: Ads, ads, and more ads. Every major premium streaming platform, save for Apple, has introduced an ad-tier by this point. So, why does Peacock’s approach to ads feel particularly obnoxious? NBCUniversal recently touted “arrival ads,” which will bombard users with an ad as soon as they log onto the platform. The company also says it’ll use AI tools to scan live content and place ads at pivotal moments with which “advertiser’s ad or creative automatically aligns.” Think big moments, like when a team hits the 10-yard line — aka, the time when a viewer would arguably be most agitated by being confronted with an ad.\n\nChallenge for 2026: Peacock has certainly had its moments, but is it considered a must-have? Having canceleld Poker Face, Based on a True Story, and more this year, the streamer just doesn’t seem to be winning viewers over with its scripted content. The looming sale of WB to one of NBCUniversal’s rivals, Netflix or Paramount, would supercharge either of those studios’ content libraries and could potentially be spell bad news for Peacock, unless it can hold out until 2029 when Taylor Sheridan arrives.\n\nBiggest question for 2026: Can sports be its saving grace? A three-year rights deal with bring the MLB to NBC and Peacock in 2026, and the platform will also host the Winter Olympics in February. Peacock also just began streaming WNBA coverage in addition to its ongoing Premier League, NFL and NBA coverage. Oh, and since NBC is hosting the Super Bowl, Peacock will simulcast that as well. While the streamer has yet to make itself essential in the scripted content space, sports buffs would be hard pressed not to have it.\n\nPrime Video\n\n2025 Highlight: Undoubtedly, Prime Video had two home runs this year: The Summer I Turned Pretty and Thursday Night Football. The third and final season of Jenny Han’s young adult romance came roaring back to the streamer this summer with an audience unlike anything it had ever seen before. Per Prime Video, it amassed 70M viewers globally in 70 days. On the NFL front, Prime Video’s fourth season of TNF is up 13% over last year, marking a third straight season of double digit growth.\n\n2025 Lowlight: Amazon canceled a lot of series this year including Étoile, Butterfly, Countdown, Bosch: Legacy, Motorheads, The Wheel of Time, Cruel Intentions, and The Runarounds. Lots of arguments to be made as to why any or all of these series should or should not have been canceled, but it’s becoming pretty clear that frequent cancellations negatively impacts consumer sentiment.\n\nChallenge for 2026: Prime Video ended the year with the return of Fallout, and Season 2 of Mr & Mrs Smith is delayed indefinitely, leaving just a few heavy hitting scripted series to come in 2026. The Boys set to end next year with its fifth and final season, and Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will also return (although, the latter’s second season struggled significantly compared to the first, so Season 3’s performance isn’t a sure bet, either). Given all the cancellations listed above, Prime Video may be hard pressed to make a mark with anything new in 2026. Titles to keep an eye on is the Legally Blonde prequel series, Elle, and the Michelle Yeoh-led Blade Runner 2099.\n\nBiggest question for 2026: Will Amazon finally become the one-stop content discovery hub? Analysts’ predictions indicate that the tech giant might eventually introduce a universal search experience that allows users to navigate directly to other external streaming services to watch content. The streamer already quietly introduced a “news hub” that aggregates content from across hundreds of news channels, signaling its desire to become the central online marketplace for not just goods, but entertainment, too.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 20:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T20:47:31.995572"}

And Chalamet’s domination around the merriest of holidays should endure with 2026’s “Dune: Part III,” set for Dec. 18.\n\n“Seemingly every year, Timothée has a major hit during the important holiday moviegoing corridor,” notes Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian. “No matter the genre, whether it’s a musical, biopic, sci-fi or comedy, his choice in the material and collaborators has made him not only a bona fide movie star, but a box-office draw.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Marty Supreme” confirms Chalamet’s status as the kind of actor whose name alone can sell a movie ticket. It’s a rare distinction these days, especially to have a star be synonymous with a season for moviegoing. The most recent example is probably Will Smith, who used to be known as Mr. Fourth of July. Starting with 1996’s “Independence Day,” several of Smith’s biggest blockbusters — 1997’s “Men In Black,” 2002’s “Men In Black II” and 2008’s “Hancock,” among them — were released in theaters around July 4th weekend.\n\nWith $17 million over the traditional weekend, “Marty Supreme” debuted at No. 3 in North America behind “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($64 million) and “Zootopia 2” ($20 million). Those initial ticket sales stand as the second-biggest debut to date for A24 after Alex Garland’s “Civil War” ($25 million over the traditional three-day weekend). “Marty Supreme,” which launched a week earlier in limited release, has generated $28.3 million to date. The movie, which cost $70 million to produce, is expected to remain a box office draw into the new year due to positive reviews (a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes) and great word-of-mouth (a “B+” grade on CinemaScore). Josh Safdie directed “Marty Supreme,” a frenetic comedy-of-errors that follows the fictional Marty Mauser as he pursues his dream of becoming a table-tennis champ.\n\n“This was a gutsy, creative risk — a period sports drama — and it’s going to pay off, thanks to Chalamet and great holiday playing time,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research.\n\nIn terms of opening weekends, “Marty Supreme” ranks between Chalamet’s other Christmastime releases. “Wonka,” a fantasy musical about a young, aspiring chocolatier, Willy Wonka, opened to $39 million in mid-December and remained a force, eventually earning $218 million domestically and $634 million worldwide. Then “A Complete Unknown,” a drama about the counterculture icon Bob Dylan, bowed to $11.6 million on Christmas Day and, by the end of its run, strung together $75 million in North America and $140 million globally. Those films didn’t have record-breaking debuts, but they all benefited from playing over the lucrative holiday season. This stretch between Christmas and New Year’s is traditionally the busiest week of the year.\n\nChalamet, who just turned 30 years old, elevated his profile through blockbusters such as “Dune” and indie favorites such as “Call Me By Your Name,” “Lady Bird” and “Little Women.” The projects that followed were commercial risks, even if they appeared like obvious wins on paper. Although “Wonka” benefitted from brand awareness — it’s a prequel to the beloved “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” — it’s the kind of execution-dependent film that doesn’t work without audiences buying into Chalamet singing and dancing about a world of pure imagination. Ditto “A Complete Unknown,” which, of course, has the advantage of great music from the “Like a Rolling Stone” composer in his earlier years. But name recognition and a passionate fandom aren’t enough to bring audiences to theaters. See: This October’s Jeremy Allen White-led biopic “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” which faltered at the box office after failing to breakout beyond the core fanbase of the Boss.\n\nSince “Marty Supreme” is completely original, Chalamet has been relentlessly marketing the film to avoid the fate of too many 2025 indies that collapsed at the box office. He’s captured the attention of the social media masses by gifting his famous friends the viral 1950s-esque windbreaker, flying a Nickelodeon-orange blimp around the country, climbing to the top of the Sphere in Las Vegas and turning the refrain “Marty Supreme. Christmas Day” into a mantra.\n\n“Timothée Chalamet is the ‘it guy’ right now. There’s no denying it,” Exhibitor Relations analyst Jeff Bock told Variety after the film’s limited release. “The promotional work he’s done with this film is high-level genius.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 22:16:41 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T22:25:49.518577"}

For New York Times readers picking up the paper today, amidst tributes to Diane Keaton, David Lynch, Angie Stone and 20 others, two names were noticeably absent from the Gray Lady’s “The Lives They Lived” section.\n\nRob Reiner and Michele Reiner.\n\nFor a Hollywood community deeply saddened and shaken by the December 14 murder of the Reiners, as the tributes to the long married duo from presidents, producers, directors, actors, agents and collaborators have made clear the past two weeks, the Misery director and his photographer spouse’s nonappearance on the NYT Mag’s eccentric annual tally has raised more than a few eyebrows.\n\n“Is it because they were violently killed?” one C-Suiter texted me this AM as he sat down to read his Sunday paper. Another industry insider wondered if the Martin Scorsese penned Christmas Day op-ed on his friendship with fellow filmmaker Reiner was the substitute for a “The Lives They Lived” piece.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nNeither theory is true. It was, like so many things, all about timing.\n\n“The Lives They Lived is a New York Times Magazine feature,” the NYT’s Danielle Rhoades Ha told me today. “Though the print publication date is Dec. 16, the content was finalized and sent for publication on Dec. 11 — three days before Rob Reiner’s death,” the SVP Communications added.\n\nIn fact, with the exception of the breaking news A section, most of the often hefty NYT is fully locked in and printed days before it hits newsstands and doorstep. The vast majority of the Sunday edition’s articles are available on the paper’s website usually three or four days beforehand, including “The Lives They Lived.”\n\nDiscovered dead by their daughter Romy and a friend on December 14 at the couple’s Brentwood home, the Reiners were killed by multiple stab wounds. In the hours that followed on that first night of Hanukkah, police tracked down and arrested the Reiner’s youngest son Nick.\n\nSet for a full hearing on January 7, the 32-year-old, who has very publicly fought drug addiction for over a decade, has now been charged with two count of first-degree murder. As the LA County DA made clear on December 16, the currently incarcerated without bail Nick Reiner faces the possibility of the death penalty or life behind bars without parole if found guilty.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the NYT has published and posted around 50 articles on the Reiners’ deaths, legacy and reaction to their murders since that tragic night of December 14 The paper has also had detailed coverage on Nick Reiner‘s arrest and subsequent charges since the 78-year-old director and the 68-year-old photographer were reported deceased.\n\nThe last SNL of 2025 saw a on-screen tribute to Reiner, who hosted the NBC late-nighter’s third ever episode in 1975, at the end of its December 21 airing. Tributes to the When Harry Met Sally director and All in the Family actor are expected at the Golden Globes and the March 15, 2026 Oscars.\n\nWhile a number of public figures from as far across the political spectrum as John Cussak to James Woods, not to mention close Renier friends like Barack and Michelle Obama (who were supposed to have dinner on December 14 with the Reiners at ex-Ambassador James Costos and Micheal Smith’s LA home) Billy Crystal, Larry David, Meg Ryan and AITF co-star Sally Struthers, have offered praise for Reiner and condolences on his death, a petulant Donald Trump has lashed out at the filmmaker twice in quick succession.\n\nOn December 15, less than 24 hours after the Reiners’ mangled remains were found, Trump called The American President director “deranged” and “bad for America” for his advocacy and critiques of the shamelessly thin skinned ex-Apprentice host.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:30:44 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-28T23:43:15.080439"}

In 1957, starring in the movie that made her a global sensation, “And God Created Woman,” what she did was not widely regarded as accomplished screen acting — or, in a certain way, as acting at all. The movie treated her as a ripe object of erotic fixation, and that’s just what she was called upon to play. She is introduced with shots of her bare feet arched just so, her body lying naked, face down on the ground. “Sex kitten.” “Baby doll.” “Teenage temptress.” At the time, she was branded all those things. Was the movie a sober French drama or soft-core porn? It was marketed as something in between.\n\nYet there was more at stake. And part of it is that Bardot, who died Sunday at 91, made no less a figure than Marilyn Monroe seem a sex symbol from an entirely different era. Monroe, while a huge star, still had one arched foot in the straitlaced past; Bardot was the woman-child of the world to come — the brazen girl who already embodied and anticipated the spirit of the swinging ’60s.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn “And God Created Woman,” she’s frisky, she’s sultry, she’s angry, she’s spectacularly uninhibited, and she signifies a new kind of erotic abandon that is liberated from the old strictures of the femme fatale. Her character, Juliette, is not a gold-digger; she rejects the advances of the rich men who come on to her. She simply does what she wants to do. “All the future does is spoil the present,” she tells a potential new lover. Yet when she learns, a bit later, that his proclamations of love are for the birds — that he doesn’t want a future with her, just a fling ­— the wounded smolder on her face becomes the ripest thing about her. At the climax, doing a dance of abandonment to the music of a hot Caribbean band, you see her literally spinning out of the control of the men around her.\n\nA word about the Bardot pout. It’s sexy as hell, but it’s a pout of steel. It has resolve. Which is why it’s so sexy. There was as much power in that pout as there was in Barbara Stanwyck’s snarl or Rita Hayworth’s come-hither glare. Maybe more. Because it’s as if Bardot had absorbed the temptation vibrations of all the screen goddesses who had come before her and was standing on their shoulders, reaching for something more…real.\n\nTwo years after “And God Created Woman” came out, becoming the top-grossing foreign-language film of all time in the United States, the great French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir wrote of Bardot, “Her clothes are not fetishes, and when she strips she is not unveiling a mystery. She is showing her body, neither more nor less, and that body rarely settles into a state of immobility. She walks, she dances, she moves about. Her eroticism is not magical, but aggressive. In the game of love, she is as much a hunter as she is a prey. The male is an object to her, just as she is to him.”\n\nThe title “And God Created Woman” sounds grandiose, but what it meant is: God had now created a new kind of woman. A woman who’s effortlessly confident and coveted, who’s the quintessence (to quote Jim Morrison) of a 20th century fox, and one who will not be the victim of the gazes of the men who surround her. When Juliette, to avoid being sent back to the orphanage she came from, agrees to marry the nice, sweet, dorky Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a priest warns him, “That girl is like an animal. She needs to be tamed.” But actually, there’s no taming what Bardot had: a casual freedom that was there in the way she held her body, and in every glance she gave.\n\nIf she was triumphantly brazen in “And God Created Woman,” in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt” (1963) she broke the law of every film ever made about love. In movies, love and romance are the most powerful of religions, and when relationships fall apart it’s for all kinds of reasons. They break down, crack up, go bust. But in “Contempt,” Bardot plays Camille, the wife of a playwright (Michel Piccoli) who’s hired to rewrite the script for a film version of “The Odyssey,” and when the fire goes out of their marriage, it’s not for some tidy dramatic explanation. It’s because…she has decided…that the fire is gone…just because. Because in the newly modern world, where women are no longer under the thumb of men, their feelings might change, and the reasons for that might be…inaccessible to the man left holding the bag of their now-empty union.\n\nThe way Bardot plays this, uttering the word “contempt” (the feeling she now has for her husband) as a wall made of stone, she exudes a tragic matter-of-factness that resides on the other side of cruelty. It is cruel, but not because she’s cruel. It’s that life is cruel. And her beauty, in cinematic terms, is part of the cruelty; it’s part of what she will now withhold. Bardot portrayed all of this, in 1963, with what could be called the consciousness of the new woman. A new awareness of choice, and of how the old rules holding the world together no longer applied.\n\nDiscussing “Contempt,” male critics tend to get fixated on the film-industry woes of Piccoli’s screenwriter (a Godard surrogate), and the world-weary travails of the director Fritz Lang (playing himself). But the heart of the movie is the half-hour-long sequence in which Bardot and Piccoli wander around their apartment in Rome, having the kind of fight that sounds less like a movie fight and more like a real fight than almost any scene in movies you could name. The sequence suggests that if Godard hadn’t decided to go the route of being an allusive postmodern brainiac creator of prankster-troll cinematic puzzles-that-never-quite-fit-together, he could have been an extraordinary poet of emotional naturalism. And the coldly beating heart of the film, which is arguably Godard’s greatest, is Brigitte Bardot’s performance.\n\nLooking back and watching Bardot’s movies now, you see hints and echoes of so many of the actresses who would come after her, from Maria Schneider to Nancy Allen to Dominique Sanda to Uma Thurman to Adèle Exarchopoulos to Sydney Sweeney. She was marketed as a pin-up, yet she was a singular presence who forged a path of sensual and spiritual fearlessness. And part of it is that she insisted, just as the Madonna of the ’80s and ’90s did, that for a certain kind of performer (her kind), sexuality was inseparable from artistry. Bardot’s eroticized projection of female identity was itself a transcendent performance. If God created woman, Bardot made you feel like she had created herself. Only time will tell if the future is female. But once she’d made her mark, the future was most definitely Bardot.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:27:20 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T02:22:38.200016"}

In total, they have had 12 number one singles and sold over 45 million records worldwide, and remain active today, with Gary, Mark, Howard and Jason set to embark on a 17-date tour, Circus Live.\n\nAll five members of the band took part in the doc, which Fullwell Entertainment is producing Take That. David Soutar (Bros: After the Screaming Stops) is the director and Gabe Turner is the exec producer.\n\nPer the synopsis: “From their early beginnings as five piece formed in Manchester to becoming pop superstars, relive the camaraderie, chaos, and resilience that fueled their meteoric rise, dramatic split, and one of the greatest comebacks in British music history. Told in their own words, this is the deeply personal and definitive story of Take That.”\n\nTake That also inspired 2022 movie Greatest Days, even going to Cannes that year to promote the Coky Giedroyc film.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:43:55 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T11:45:33.677559"}

But instead of heralding a dramatic return to moviegoing, 2025 is running neck-and-neck with the middling 2024 box office, and will fall far short of the $9 billion in domestic ticket sales that most analysts expected the theatrical movie business to easily eclipse. Prior to the pandemic, North American revenues would regularly hit between $10 billion to $11 billion. The 2025 results are a massive disappointment that no amount of spin can change. (Already there’s talk of how much better 2026 will be.)\n\n“There’s an unfortunate trend, which that we just can’t get the industry to $9 billion at the domestic box office,” says Mike Sherrill, the chief operating officer of dine-in cinema chain Alamo Drafthouse. “It looks like it’s going to be two years in a row that the industry flatlined.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMore worrisome is the reality that many of the movie business’s biggest franchises are showing signs of oversaturation or fatigue. Marvel continued to struggle with its B Team heroes; February’s “Captain America: Brave New World” and May’s “Thunderbolts” lost tens of millions during their theatrical runs, while July’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” will only eke out a modest profit. And even though “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($760 million and counting), “Wicked: For Good” ($504 million) and “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($869 million) will rank among the year’s top-grossing releases, they will fail to match the revenues of previous films in their respective series. Clearly, the theatrical industry can’t thrive on sequels and spinoffs alone.\n\nIt would be easy to declare an end to comic book movies. That said, genres have risen and fallen throughout Hollywood history — just look at musicals or westerns or raunchy comedies, which have faded in popularity after once being surefire draws. What really has theater owners and some studio chiefs concerned as the year closes out is what the future will hold if Netflix is able to secure government approval for its $82.7 billion deal to buy Warner Bros. Already, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has hinted that he believes that “windows,” industry jargon for the amount of time that movies play exclusively in theaters, are too long. He told Wall Street shortly after the pact was announced that he expects that they will “evolve” in a more “consumer friendly” direction. Everyone knows exactly what he meant by that.\n\nFor cinemas, it’s nothing short of an existential threat. During COVID, studios abbreviated the gap between a film’s theatrical release and its home entertainment debut, only to discover that customers got accustomed to waiting to watch movies until they hit streaming or on-demand platforms. If windows keep shrinking, theaters may lose their competitive advantage.\n\nThere were also reasons to feel optimistic about the trajectory of an industry that has been knocked down and counted out for half-a-decade. China, which had been hostile to Hollywood fare since the pandemic, embraced a few major studio releases such as “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” signaling that one of the world’s biggest moviegoing markets is still accessible to certain U.S. productions. Of course, China is doing just fine without Hollywood — thank you, very much. The year’s highest-grossing release isn’t an English-language production but rather the Chinese animated sequel “Ne Zha 2,” which has generated more than $2.1 billion globally, despite the fact that most Americans would draw a blank at the title.\n\nFamily films and video game adaptations proved irresistible to audiences, who flocked to theaters to see the likes of “A Minecraft Movie,” “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2.” The three films, all of which carry PG ratings, were the three highest-grossing Hollywood productions, with “A Minecraft Movie” tapping out just shy of $1 billion and “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2” both crossing that threshold. It’s the second consecutive year that PG films outgrossed their PG-13 counterparts, which is notable because it’s usually the other way around. Meanwhile anime proved to be a massive boon, with “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” and “Chainsaw Man” scoring back-to-back wins for Sony-owned Crunchyroll.\n\n“What happened with ‘Demon Slayer’ is great because it opens a new category of film,” says Sherrill of Alamo Drafthouse. “About 49% of the audience was under 24 years old. That’s so important because we need to be thinking about what’s going to be relevant for the next generation of moviegoers.”\n\nComic book content is no longer king. After being the most popular genre for over a decade, these movies have recently looked a lot less superhuman. The latest “Captain America” suffered from a prolonged post-production and extensive rewrites, with critics piling on when the film debuted in February. Although “Fantastic Four” and “Thunderbolts” movies were much better regarded, they still failed to match the kind of grosses that Marvel movies used to routinely achieve before the pandemic. Marvel Studios will have a chance to recapture its box office prowess with next July’s “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” as well as December’s “Avengers: Doomsday,” which brings back Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans.\n\nMarvel’s rival, DC Films, fared better with “Superman,” a generally well-received Man of Steel adventure that grossed $616 million. A lot had been riding on the success of the film, which centers on the most recognizable name in DC Comics. James Gunn, who took over DC with Peter Safran in 2022, directed the film and positioned it as a reset for a company in desperate need of a fresh direction. For years, DC films such as “Justice League” and “The Flash” have been slammed as too dark and dense. Gunn and Safran wanted to recapture the humor and hope that defined Richard Donner’s 1978 classic, “Superman.” DC’s real challenge will come next year when the studio fields films like “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” which are based on far lesser known characters.\n\n“We needed to have the DC logo be synonymous with quality again,” Safran says. “For too long, our movies had suffered from real inconsistency. It takes time to develop a positive reputation, but this put us on the right track.”\n\nIt was a disappointing year for many adult-oriented dramas, with the likes of “The Smashing Machine,” “Bugonia” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” failing to make much of a dent at the box office. However, some studios took artistic gambles that paid off handsomely, none more so than Warner Bros., which bet on idiosyncratic horror films like Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” and Zach Cregger’s “Weapons,” both of which attracted huge crowds after they debuted to rave reviews. And awards buzz helped another of the studio’s auteur-driven films, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” gross more than $200 million. The only problem: With a budget of $140 million and tens of millions spent on marketing, the film stands to lose $100 million theatrically since studios and exhibitors essentially split ticket sales.\n\n“The good news is that when a movie catches the eye of a filmgoing audience, they are ready and excited to go. We saw all kinds of movies work this year,” says Adam Fogelson, chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “The challenge is if you have something that, for whatever reason, doesn’t spark people’s interest, the floor is non-existent, regardless of the level of star power. You can have a movie that the audience likes and no one goes to see.”\n\nTom Cruise’s star power may be dimming, as evidenced by the diminished returns of the mega-budgeted “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” It ranks among the year’s biggest bombs and may put Ethan Hunt on hiatus, at least until Cruise’s adventure films get less costly. But other talent is ascending to the A-list. Timothée Chalamet, for example, proved that he’s one of the hottest names in movies. The 30-year-old actor has helped make A24’s “Marty Supreme,” a period movie about ping pong, into an unlikely holiday season hit. Credit goes to the star who helped mastermind a promotional push that saw him deploy everything from bright orange blimps to viral videos in service of the indie drama — the marketing blitz drew TikTok fans, as well as arthouse aficionados.\n\nMovie theaters have also relied heavily on premium large formats like Imax and Dolby. The popularity of those screens, which more expensive than the average movie ticket, has helped to offset the decline in attendance. For visual spectacles like “Avatar: Fire and Ash” or “F1: The Movie,” those PLFs have accounted for 50% to 60% of overall sales. Although industry sales were essentially flat, Imax delivered its best-ever year at the box office with $1.2 billion globally.\n\n“We branched out in genres,” says Imax’s CEO Richard Gelfond. “We were known more in 2022 and 2023 for superhero movies and sequels. This year, we did a lot more in horror and family films. Three of the four biggest animated films in our history were this year, which I don’t think is a coincident. The public’s attitude is expanding to the kind of films they like to see in Imax.”\n\nHe suggests that “more diversified content would help insulate theaters from some Hollywood changes.”\n\nExhibitors have, in fact, been turning to alternative content to populate their screens during the slower months. “Kill Bill” or “Back to the Future” re-releases or “Jaws” anniversary screenings have helped Alamo, for one, pace 5% ahead of the industry’s year-over-year returns. But cinema operators are keenly aware that oldies aren’t going to keep the lights by themselves. They need Hollywood to supply the kind of new releases that turn multiplexes back into the epicenter of culture.\n\n“I would like to think that studios and distributors are looking at the trends and seeing that original, fresh stories are working,” says Sherrill. “So don’t just give me 20 more movies.

The news comes three days before the fourth season of the Winkleman-hosted The Traitors launches.\n\nWinkleman, who is enjoying quite the purple patch after a 30-year career, will front the seven-episode primetime BBC talk show that will “welcome the biggest names from the worlds of film, television, music and beyond to her sofa for lively conversation with the help of a studio audience,” the BBC said. Broadcast information and guests will be revealed “in due course.”\n\nThe Claudia Winkleman Show will debut on BBC One and BBC iPlayer in spring 2026. We revealed that the long-gestating chat show was being produced by The Graham Norton Show maker So Television and Little Arrow in October. Those plans, we understand, will see Winkleman’s series broadcast when The Graham Norton Show is off-air in the spring, meaning there will be no clashes between the shows and they will not be competing for guests. The BBC recently renewed The Graham Norton Show for another three years, while its recent run of episodes has boasted eye-catching bookings including Taylor Swift. Winkleman earned her chat show stripes by stepping in for Norton earlier this year when the Irish presenter was on a break from his BBC duties. ITV Studios-backed So Television has made more than 550 episodes of his Friday night talk show since 2007.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“Claudia is a true national treasure – warm, witty and endlessly entertaining,” said BBC commissioning editor Kalpna Patel-Knight. “She has an extraordinary ability to put people at ease and bring out the very best in them, whether they’re global superstars or members of the audience.”\n\nWinkleman’s star has soared since hosting the first season of The Traitors in 2022 and its celebrity spin-off several weeks back. She also fronts Channel 4’s The Piano, while she presented BBC Radio 2’s Saturday morning breakfast show until last year. She will have more time on her hands, however, now that she has presented her final episode of Strictly Come Dancing, the BBC Saturday night juggernaut that she has fronted with Tess Daly since 2010.\n\nThe latest civilian season of The Traitors is set to launch on New Year’s Day (January 1, 2026). Winkleman has been in the press overnight teasing “truly extraordinary” twists and “hardcore” round tables for the murder mystery reality series, with a red-cloaked figure keeping fans guessing.\n\nWinkleman said: “I can’t quite believe it and I’m incredibly grateful to the BBC for this amazing opportunity. I’m obviously going to be awful, that goes without saying, but I’m over the moon they’re letting me try.”\n\nSo Television Managing Director Graham Stuart added: “Graham Norton has made the Friday night talk show slot a dazzling appointment to view. How can you possibly follow that? By booking a host equally as brilliant. So we have.”\n\nSo Television’s co-production partner on Winkleman’s chat show, Little Arrow, is the management and production company launched by Winkleman’s agent, Holly Bott, in July 2024. The company has the backing of Operation Mincemeat maker Archery Pictures, the drama production house that Winkleman’s husband, Kris Thykier, leads as CEO.\n\nExecutive producers on The Claudia Winkleman Show are Stuart and Ruth Phillips.

Per the official logline, “Ember & Ice” follows fae princes Dane and Finn from rival Solari and Lunare kingdoms. The series, “set in a richly imagined fantasy world shaped by history, duty, and forbidden desire,” is “a story about choosing love in defiance of expectation” and amplifies “every moment of tension, longing, and intimacy.”\n\nQuinn confirmed that Storrie will not be reading in an accent as he does in “Heated Rivalry,” posting on X, “We tried.” While some Quinn original stories feature the main character speaking directly to the reader, this will be a gay romance, without a self-insert listener character.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Hudson and Connor have a really special chemistry, and we feel incredibly lucky to work with them,” says Quinn founder and CEO Caroline Spiegel. “The way they connect with audiences and show up in the cultural conversation is exciting to watch.”\n\nThe first two episodes will debut on Dec. 30, exclusively on Quinn, the leading audio erotica platform and the destination for female-first audio erotica. The company works with both non-celebrity narrators and voice actors, both known as “creators,” who tell stories directly to the audience members, placing the listener as the main character.\n\nSince 2022, Quinn Originals has partnered with multiple recognizable actors to lead storytelling. Christopher Briney joined following the end of “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” Previously narrators include Andrew Scott, Tom Blyth, Jamie Campbell Bower, Manny Jacinto, Jesse Williams, Victoria Pedretti, Thomas Doherty, Lucien Laviscount and Katherine Moennig.\n\nThe new romance comes on the heels of the “Heated Rivalry” finale, which dropped on Dec. 26. The Canadian series was a massive hit for both Bell Media’s Crave streamer and HBO Max, once they bought it and decided to push it out this year instead of waiting until 2026. It’s since been renewed for a second season.\n\nCasey Bloys was surprised when the show became such a quick smash hit for the streamer. “I thought it would be kind of a very specific, maybe gay-only show, but it really is a broader audience than that. From a business point of view, the money we spent for acquisition was an incredible investment,” he recently told Variety. “I’ve been at HBO for over 20 years. I’ve done a lot of shows with sex scenes. I think what was interesting about them here was, for anybody who has been closeted for any amount of time, and especially in the show — that kind of high-pressure situation of a professional sports team, where coming out is even harder — the sex was a little bit more reflective of that feeling of ‘You’re never going to find this again.’ It was intense, but to me, it amplified what they were trying to do with the storytelling. That said, I’m not complaining that they were attractive and hot. And I will say, as I told Jacob [Tierney], very well-directed.”\n\nSee exclusive photos from “Ember & Ice” below:", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:37:57 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T17:46:31.757918"}

But in 2025, Fox had the Big Game: And a a result, the network was up double digits in both total viewers and adults 18-49 (where it was No. 1).\n\nBut don’t count out the strength of regular programming, as CBS — even sans Super Bowl, which it broadcast in 2024 — managed to stay No. 1 in total viewers thanks to series like “Tracker” and “60 Minutes.” ABC, meanwhile, was up 5%, after being virtually flat in 2024 — meaning for two years in a row, the Alphabet net has managed to keep the viewership erosion at bay. In an age where primetime numbers are naturally going down as audiences flock to streaming, that’s nearly a miracle. (Well, and ABC has been helped by airing more NFL Monday Night Football games the past two years.)\n\nThis reps the first year that Nielsen’s big data + panel ratings were implemented, which now mix both Nielsen panel data from viewers along with set-top box and smart TV datasets. That has caused some grumbling in the industry, given some missing data and inaccuracies that have been found. It also makes year-to-year comparisons that might be a bit apples and oranges. Most noticable in this year’s charts are a stabilization in the primetime ratings for kids’ networks Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. After years of annual double-digit declines, Disney was down slightly in 2025, and Nick was actually up (both saw gains in 18-49). No one believes that kids have suddenly started watching linear again — but no one can really explain the change there, other than perhaps a quirk in this year’s methodology.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nTomorrow, Variety will share the ranker of this year’s most-watched primetime telecasts. But here, we recount which networks were up and down in 2025.\n\nWINNERS\n\nFox Corp.: Fox famously downsized after selling its studio operations and most of its networks to Disney — but the channels it held on to did quite well in 2025. Fox was up 10% in both total viewers and adults 18-49 (where it was No. 1), thanks to the power of the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Fox News defied the post-election downward trend seen by MS Now (formerly MSNBC) and CNN.\n\nThe CW: Speaking of controversial companies that had reason to cheer, Nexstar saw its The CW network climb 13% in total viewers, while Newsnation grew 16% — albeit, from low numbers. But a shift toward more live sports is clearly having an impact on The CW, which also saw its adults 18-49 rating climb a hair.\n\nESPN: Sports! ESPN’s still got it, and this year climbed 18% — the most of any network in the top 30 among total viewers. The other big story is ESPN in adults 18-49, where this year it’s one of the Big 4 — jumping 10% to rank as the No. 4 network in primetime, beating out CBS.\n\nTruTV: Ooh la la! The French Open clearly had an impact on Tru TV, a channel that has gone through many lives (starting as Court TV, then later as a reality-focused channel, then the comedy-focused home of “Impractical Jokers”). This year, which this year shed most of its remaining comedy product (“Impractical Jokers” is now on TBS) to focus even more as a secondary home for TNT Sports fare. That paid off when it came to the French Open, which included wall-to-wall replays and coverage on Tru TV. Ratings for the full tournament were up 25% this year on TNT and TruTV, and that probably explains why TruTV bucked the trend of cablers (including its other Warner Bros. Discovery siblings), jumping 46% in viewers and 27% in 18-49. (Again, those percentages are huge because TruTV was coming in at a much smaller audience.)\n\nLOSERS\n\nFamilies: Channels with “Family” in their titles did not fare well in 2025. Family Entertainment TV, down 29%. Great American Family, down 18%. Hallmark Family, down 14%. Discovery Family Channel, down 22%. To be fair, it’s tough out there for virtually all linear cable networks. If families are still watching TV together, it’s not on these “family” channels.\n\nDr. Phil: One-time talk powerhouse Dr. Phil McGraw launched his Merit Street TV network (now just “Merit TV”) in 2024 and got on the board with a paltry average of 27,000 viewers.

One thing they have in common is a specific color: A deep red, the color of a jammy merlot, is a throughline that appears in each character’s contemporary clothing.\n\nSet in New York state, Dublin and Paris, the three segments each revolve around an adult sibling pair. While in the first two, the siblings have somewhat uncomfortable interactions with their parents, in the third Paris section, the twin brother and sister have only memories of their late parents to excavate.\n\nThe clothes worn by cast members including Adam Driver, Cate Blanchett and Charlotte Rampling appear to be everyday items, but costume designer Catherine George explains that all the pieces seen onscreen — even Tom Waits’ very mundane hoodie — were made by iconic French fashion house Saint Laurent, a backer of the film.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe idea for the red theme came from Jarmusch, about whom George enigmatically says, “In the last few years, he’s been seeing colors in a different way. Red specifically looks different to him than it used to.”\n\n“Jim called me about the movie pretty early on,” George says.\n\n“He said, ‘We’ve got this movie, it’s shooting in New York, Dublin and Paris.’ I’m from Ireland and shooting at home was amazing, and also shooting in Paris, incredible.”\n\n“And then he said, ‘Well, it’s a little complicated, because YSL will be collaborating with us, but I want you to design the costumes. We’ll be using some of their pieces that already fit the characters, but if they don’t, then you’re designing them.'”\n\n“Jim already had a color theme — I think it was for one character — a sort of red and pink combination, and he wanted to carry that theme through all the stories, at least the red.\n\n“It’s nice to start a project and already have a sort of a theme that you’re working within, rather than just grabbing at straws,” she says. “It sort of gave me a base to think about while I was designing.”\n\nGeorge, who has worked several times with Bong Joon Ho and also has “Die, My Love” this year, previously collaborated with Jarmusch on “The Dead Don’t Die” and “Paterson.” Below, she breaks down how the wardrobe for each segment was created.\n\nTom Waits wore a hoodie custom made by Saint Laurent with a subtle burgundy lining. ©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nPart One: Father\n\nTom Waits is an eccentric, solitary dad who is visited in his rural New York home by his wary, traditional son (played by Adam Driver) and daughter (Mayim Bialik). Driver and Bialik’s styles mirror each other; they’re both in conservative blazers over deep red sweaters, while Waits sports a casual zippered hoodie.\n\nDriver’s clothes were “not unlike his real clothes,” says George. “Tom’s character was a little more involved,” says George, “because he lives in a cabin and he’s portraying himself as a penniless father.”\n\nFor Waits, they had originally though he would wear a robe or pajamas. “We initially had thought of sort of a dressing gown for him. But when I went to fit him, I went to his studio in California and had the tailor from YSL with me, and Tom tried on the dressing gown and wasn’t quite feeling it,” she says.\n\n\n\n“When we arrived, he was in a hoodie,” she recalls. “So we used the pajamas that we’d made for him, and I said, ‘Let’s try your hoodie on with it.’ He felt more like the character, more comfortable and natural.”\n\nOf course, even the drab hoodie got a subtle burgundy lining.\n\n\n\n“Each each item of clothing, they would either send me images of something existing, or I would send them an image of a particular piece, and they would source the fabric. So it was a back and forth across continents,” George says.\n\nThough Waits’ character acts like he’s possibly broke, it turns out that might be an act — one clue is a snazzy suit he dons at the end of the segment.\n\n“When Tom changes at the end into a suit to go out, that was fun to make a really beautiful suit in the specific color, and his shoes I really loved,” George says. “He wore some creepers, like he wears in real life. So we had a pair made in burgundy, which were unbelievably beautiful.”\n\nCharlotte Rampling’s red Saint Laurent shirtdress was adapted from a jumpsuit design. ©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nPart Two: Mother\n\nIn the second segment, strait-laced Cate Blanchett and free-spirited Vicky Krieps make a once-a-year visit to their rather stiff novelist mother Charlotte Rampling in her Dublin home. The trio’s distinct personalities are evident in their wardrobes.\n\n“We seem to be accidentally color-coordinated,” Rampling’s character says, underlining the awkwardness. “How embarrassing!”\n\nWith pink-tinted hair and a fluffy fake fur coat over a printed red sweater, Krieps’ character is “a bit of a party girl,” George explains, though she’s also putting on a show — she’s possibly not the successful influencer she makes out to be.\n\nBlanchett’s character is frankly uptight, which is instantly signaled by the way she wears an oxford shirt over a burgundy turtleneck. Her clothes weren’t pulled from existing YSL collections, George says. “We had come up with the shirt, but then we wanted to incorporate the red, and that was, again, finding a balance. A whole red sweater would have been too much, but putting the shirt on top added to her sort of buttoned-up version of herself.”\n\nRampling’s character, meanwhile, makes the most of the couture tailoring in a burgundy shirtdress that was based on a YSL jumpsuit design.\n\n“They made beautiful pieces,” George says. “The thing with working with YSL is they have access to so much incredible fabric and their production is gorgeous. When the pieces arrived, they were beautifully made: the shoe, the bags. Even Kate’s sort of dowdy pieces were really beautifully made and executed.”\n\nBut even YSL pieces need to be aged to make them look lived in, she says.\n\n“I find it jarring when I see something that looks too fresh, too new, if the character is not that kind of person. You know, Tom’s hoodie, his his sweatshirt, his pajamas — they all went through a process of being washed and aged,” says George, though she adds that Rampling’s character is the type who would take very good care of her clothes.\n\nLuka Sabbat and Indya Moore play twin siblings, who wear leather jackets with slightly different designs. ©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nPart Three: Sister, Brother\n\nIn the final segment, siblings played by Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat drive through Paris to their late parents’ empty apartment to talk about their family. They’re as naturalistic and free-spirited as the other siblings are rigid.\n\n“They’re twins and they have some kind of psychic messaging system, and their biker jackets, even though they’re two different versions, are quite similar,” says George. “His is a classic sort of motorcycle jacket, and hers is more of a fashion type.”\n\nThough the color theme isn’t as obvious, Indya’s character does wear a red tank top, which was based on a piece George actually owned but in a Saint Laurent-designed version.\n\nAs for Sabbat’s character, “We decided to keep him in a classic white T-shirt as just a sort of iconic movie character,” she says.\n\nAfter working on fantastical films such as “Mickey 17” and “Snowpiercer,” George says working with Saint Laurent was a welcome change of pace. “It was nice to get very specific and go back to a combination of costumes and fashion. I trained in fashion design, so it was nice to combine the two things.”\n\nLuka Sabbat, left, wore a classic white t-shirt, while Indya Moore’s red tank top was based on one owned by costumer designer Catherine George. “Father Mother Sister Brother” (Courtesy of Yorick Le Saux/Vague Notion)", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:24:15 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T18:38:13.871766"}

Ollinger was then rebooked for Open Murder. The investigation is ongoing and led by the LVMPD Homicide Section.\n\nOver the course of five seasons, the most recent of which concluded this past August, Ollinger appeared in nearly all of the 40 episodes.

Brady said, ‘It’s a musical, that’s what it is.'” Fastvold tells Crew Call, “So quite early on in the writing process, I realized, I just had to embrace that they lived their life like they were in a musical.”\n\nFastvold worked with choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall after finishing the script to bring the yesteryear dance moves to life.\n\nThe movie, which Searchlight purchased following its Venice Film Festival premiere for mid-to-high seven figures, recently opened in four theaters in 70MM in LA and NYC this past weekend posting a $111K 4-day opening. Weekend shows at the Landmark Sunset Theatres in LA had two pre-receptions and live performances which included Rowlson-Hall presenting a bespoke 13-minute performance with ten dancers and three original performers from the film, all wearing their costumes from the movie. The movie expands on Jan. 16 to other cities.\n\nSeyfried received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy) for her portrayal of Ann Lee. The film was also nominated for the Gotham Awards, and the Critics Choice (Seyfried for Best Actress and Daniel Blumberg’s “Clothed by the Sun” in Best Song) and Film Independent Spirit Awards (Best Editing).\n\nListen here:", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:45:49 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T18:58:52.952487"}

It’s agonizing to go over this list, check it twice and many more times before committing to a final 10, knowing the parameters require me to leave out many worthy films.\n\nThe upside of the task is to reflect anew on work that moved and enlightened me in the past year and to try to capture something of the filmmaker’s creative achievement. Another reward: the potential for alerting readers to documentaries that may have escaped their attention. In truth, plenty of documentaries escaped my attention; no one can watch all the nonfiction features released each year nor come anywhere close. In other words, this is a top 10 list of the films I was fortunate to experience, not of all documentaries that reached audiences in 2025, whether through festivals, theaters, online distribution, streaming platforms, et al.\n\nHere are my selections in alphabetical order:\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n2000 Meters to Andriivka‘ PBS Distribution/Frontline/AP\n\nThe most visceral war film I’ve ever seen. Director Mstyslav Chernov, who documented the earliest weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the Oscar-winning 20 Days in Mariupol, follows a new stage of the conflict as it descends into a meter-by-meter fight for territory. Risking his life again, the director embeds with a Ukrainian platoon attempting to retake the minuscule town of Andriivka that had been seized by Russian invaders. It’s brutal trench warfare reminiscent of World War I; perhaps for that reason the film evokes, for me, the classic All Quiet on the Western Front.\n\nMany of the Ukrainian soldiers we meet in the film are doomed to die in future skirmishes, as Chernov tells us in solemn narration. Most have volunteered to defend their homeland — in contrast to Russian forces made up mostly of conscripts, freed convicts, mercenaries from North Korea and elsewhere. As President Donald Trump continues to vacillate on Ukraine, at best offering it tepid support, it’s essential to recognize the outrageous scale of the Russian bloodbath that has killed at least 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and roughly 15,000 civilians. 2000 Meters to Andriivka achieves that end with devastating force.\n\n2000 Meters to Andriivka can be watched for free on YouTube or via the PBS website and PBS app.\n\nYoung poet Youbin Gong in ‘Always (从来)’ HandsOn Studio LLC/TimeLight Films\n\nDeming Chen’s debut feature documentary introduces us to young poet Youbin Gong, a boy from a small Chinese village who writes poems as part of his schoolwork. The film is visual poetry – Chen’s camera captures the pastoral setting of Sangzhi County in Hunan Province and Gong’s humble home life. In what by American standards would be considered a hovel, Gong is raised by his aging grandparents, his mother having abandoned him as a small child. The filmmaker boldly eschews traditional narrative structure in favor of sequences built around poems by Gong and some of his classmates. This takes us out of the logical adult world of calendar progression and into the sensory experience of a child like Gong – a comparatively timeless realm of feeling, emotion, observation and isolation.\n\nAlways gives us insight into contemporary China where many children grow up without parents – moms and dad who must leave their kids behind in rural areas as they seek employment in cities. In that sense, it reveals as much about Chinese society as the vérité films of Wang Bing’s Youth trilogy.\n\nAlways is playing at select film festivals; it does not have theatrical or streaming distribution.\n\nTwo other excellent documentaries I saw this year offer a fascinating picture of life in China. The Dating Game, directed by Violet Du Feng, shows us the struggle of young men to find spouses in a country where males outnumber females by a large margin (a result of China’s one-child policy, which saw many female offspring aborted or abandoned in favor of male children). Elizabeth Lo’s Mistress Dispeller, meanwhile, explores a different element of romantic life in China: “mistress dispellers,” relationship specialists that advertise their services to women whose husbands are cheating on them, promising to disrupt the extramarital affair.\n\nElizabeth Bouvia with her legal team in the 1980s PBS\n\nFilmmaker Reid Davenport, who was born with cerebral palsy, notes in his film that abled people often casually inquire whether he has ever considered killing himself. The obvious implication of such a question (though it may not be evident to those asking it) is that a disabled person’s life has no value.\n\nExploring this pervasive attitude towards disability, Davenport takes as his launching point the case of Elizabeth Bouvia, a young woman with cerebral palsy and degenerative arthritis who entered a California hospital essentially asking the facility to assist in her death. This was in the early 1980s before assisted suicide — now known as physician-assisted dying or medical aid in dying — had gained much traction; courts back then rejected Bouvia’s request. Today, California joins a dozen states and the District of Columbia with laws that entitle people to end their lives with the aid of physicians under certain circumstances. Early in 2026, New York’s governor is expected to sign a bill with similar provisions.\n\nWith great intellectual acuity, Davenport examines how in Canada the right to die is being made available not just to those with terminal illnesses but to disabled people with chronic conditions that aren’t life-threatening in the near term. Beneath this expansion of rights, which could expand south to the U.S., the filmmaker detects a desire by the able-bodied to eradicate disability, akin to eugenics. He discovers that in many cases, including Bouvia’s, disabled people who contemplate using medical aid in dying would prefer to live if they could just get proper access to health care, pain management, psychological services and other support.\n\nFor Davenport, it’s consistent with a lifelong dilemma that he and others with disabilities encounter: how to find “one’s place in a world that perpetually rejects them.”\n\nLife After is available to stream on the PBS website and the PBS app.\n\nMr. Nobody Against Putin\n\nPavel Talankin, co-director and participant in ‘Mr. Nobody Against Putin’ Made in Copenhagen/ZDF/Arte\n\nThe endearing Pavel Talankin, a young man devoted to his students at a grade school in the grim Russian town of Karabash, ponders his life and concludes, “I might be a self-destructive person.”\n\nThe nature of his “self-destructive behavior” breaks the heart – he dares to advocate for freedom of expression, to criticize Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and to oppose the increasingly systematic indoctrination and militarization of schoolchildren by the state. Over the course of the film, directed by David Borenstein and Talankin, “Pasha,” as he is known, goes from beloved educator to something of a pariah at Karabash Primary School #1. He’s marked as a dissident for responding with defiance to lesson plans mandated by federal authorities after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that teach youngsters to become Russian nationalists.\n\nIn one scene, he peels off the letter Z (a pro-war symbol in Russia) masking-taped to school windows, replacing it with an X, an expression of support for Ukraine. At another moment, over the school’s PA system, he plays America’s national anthem.\n\nPasha’s brave, perhaps a bit naïve or innocent, and certainly lovable – and in the Russia of 2025 there is no place for such a person. Chillingly, in the film Russian President Vladimir Putin alludes to the importance of controlling the minds of his country’s young people as the war in Ukraine approaches a fourth year, observing in a television appearance, “Commanders don’t win wars. Teachers win wars.”\n\nMr. Nobody Against Putin is available for streaming in the UK via the BBCi player. It is currently unavailable in the U.S.\n\nKsenia Mironova in ‘My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air In Moscow.’ Argot Pictures\n\nPutin also casts a long shadow over Julia Loktev’s film. The Russian president is seen in a clip pontificating, “Freedom of press, the right of citizens to receive and distribute information, is a fundamental principle of any democratic government and society.”\n\nRussia’s leaders have long excelled at this kind of gaslighting, dating back to Soviet times. The film documents the last vestiges of independent news media as they’re crushed by the Kremlin – outlets like TV Rain and the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. Those news sources, along with the human rights nonprofit Memorial and even a group that advocates for laws protecting women from domestic violence, have been declared “undesirable organizations” by the Russian government. Individual reporters at TV Rain, Important Stories and other outlets are officially branded as “foreign agents,” stamping them with social stigma and snaring them in a legal and administrative quagmire.\n\nThe lengthy film – total running time 5 hours, 24 minutes – unfolds almost like a “lifestyle reality TV” series as we follow the activities of TV Rain journalists including anchor Anna Nemzer and reporter Ksenia Mironova, and Important Stories reporter Irina Dolinina, among others. But unlike the trivialities of lifestyle reality shows on American TV, the stakes here could hardly be higher: the characters in the film, all brave women, face potential harsh prison sentences if they continue to stray outside the Putin party line. Despite the risk, they insist that even if they can’t hope to change Russia, they can document what’s going down for a future generation to learn. In this, they prove themselves worthy successors to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, author of the mighty Gulag Archipelago that chronicled how Stalin and his Bolshevik predecessors committed vast crimes against their people.\n\nThe dedication to freedom of expression displayed by the women in My Undesirable Friends should inspire anyone concerned that America, under a Putin-friendly Trump, is sliding towards totalitarianism.\n\nMy Undesirable Friends: Part I – Last Air in Moscow has been playing at film festivals. It is not yet available on VOD platforms or streaming services.\n\nPolice shine a light on Susan Lorincz’s house in ‘ The Perfect Neighbor Netflix\n\nGeeta Gandbhir’s film grips from its opening frame as police officers respond to a dispatcher’s report of a shooting in a neighborhood of Ocala, FL. The filmmaker restricts herself almost entirely to police body cam and dash cam video to elucidate an awful crime – the killing of a Black woman, 35-year-old mother of four Ajike Owens, who was shot to death by her neighbor, a 58-year-old white woman named Susan Lorincz.\n\nIt’s a film of heart-racing tension and almost unbearable tragedy, but essential viewing for anyone who wishes to understand the fatal intersection of race and policing in America. Here, a fairy tale-level ogre in Lorincz gets the benefit of the doubt from police because of her whiteness. For two years leading up to the fatal shooting, as police archive video shows, Lorincz constantly called 911 to make false allegations about her Black neighbors, reserving many of her most strident complaints for children who played near her house (on property they were entitled to enjoy). Police officers, in my view, coddled Lorincz and failed to protect her Black neighbors, Owens among them.\n\nWhen Owens came to Lorincz’s house to discuss the latest incident of harassment against her kids, Lorincz fired a gun from behind her locked door, killing her neighbor. In self-pitying fashion, Lorincz tearily claimed she had feared for her life. Thus, she invoked Florida’s notorious “stand your ground” law, which gives people carte blanche (blanche, it should be noted, being the French word for “white”) to kill under a wide array of circumstances. Lorincz might never have been prosecuted and convicted if the community hadn’t risen in protest.\n\nThe Perfect Neighbor is streaming on Netflix.\n\nLeni Riefenstahl with Hitler Kino Lorber\n\nLeni Riefenstahl, the pioneering German director known to history as Hitler’s favorite filmmaker, is esteemed by many Hollywood luminaries, Quentin Tarantino among them. Their admiration might dim considerably if they saw Andres Veiel’s stunning film about her.\n\nVeiel, conducting a forensic examination of Riefenstahl’s archives and other sources, picks apart the myth the filmmaker propagated after World War II that absolved herself of any complicity in Nazi atrocities. She had merely been an artist taking on assignments from the Führer, she claimed. In fact, Riefenstahl was a true believer. Veiel uncovers evidence of her extolling Nazi ideology as early as 1934 and he shares audio of Riefenstahl, in the post-war years, resuming her warm friendship with Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production under the Nazis. Riefenstahl and Speer speculate on how many generations it will take before Germany once again embraces Nazi thinking (their estimate: two).\n\nWhen I interviewed Veiel shortly before the film’s world premiere at the 2024 Venice Film Festival, he noted an implicit warning contained in his documentary – beware of anyone in power who spins a distorted narrative to realize a dark purpose.\n\n“We see it with our populist leaders — they just lie,” he told me. “It becomes the truth. And that’s a very, very dangerous and attractive way of turning lies into truth. And she’s a prototype.”\n\nRiefenstahl is available on VOD platforms including Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, the Roku Channel and Apple TV.\n\nSara Jane Moore in ‘ Suburban Fury Argot Pictures\n\nWhen Sara Jane Moore died in September at the age of 95, obituaries recounted the strange and disturbing incident that thrust her into the national spotlight decades earlier. In September 1975, the former suburban housewife stood outside a San Francisco hotel where President Gerald Ford was speaking and, when he emerged, held up a pistol and squeezed off a shot at him. She got off a second shot, but a bystander grabbed her arm and deflected the bullet.\n\nIn Robinson Devor’s fascinating documentary, the filmmaker explores how Moore came close to succeeding in her aim, building his narrative around interviews with the would-be assassin after she was released from prison following 32 years behind bars. It’s a time capsule from the 1970s, a peculiar era of upheaval that saw movements like the Symbionese Liberation Army spring up with sometimes vague revolutionary goals. It was the SLA that kidnapped Patty Hearst and successfully persuaded the young heiress to join their cause; the Hearst case became key in Moore’s evolution to left-wing militancy.\n\nThe film isn’t a morally ambiguous “let’s turn the microphone over to an attempted presidential assassin” but something more cogent: a documentation of the unexpected and circuitous radicalization of a once-conservative woman. The story sheds light on an earlier era in America that’s often overlooked – a decade lost between the momentous and well chronicled 1960s and the increasingly corporatized 1980s.\n\nSuburban Fury will be released in theaters in 2026 by Argot Pictures. Kino Lorber will later make the film available on VOD platforms.\n\nGen. Alfredo Stroessner, president of Paraguay, saluting during a visit to Franco’s Spain on July 1, 1973 Keystone/Getty Images\n\nAmong Latin American dictators of an earlier era, Chile’s Augusto Pinochet is probably best known in the U.S. But one shouldn’t forget the reign of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled Paraguay from 1954-1989. Filmmaker Juanjo Pereira certainly hasn’t. He probes Stroessner’s regime in his archival documentary that won the FIPRESCI critics prize at the Berlin Film Festival. During the dictator’s time in power, he “disappeared” 20,000 perceived left-wing political opponents, probably outpointing Pinochet in that regard and rivaling Argentina’s dictator Gen. Jorge Videla.\n\nVery little footage from that time exists — such regimes preferring to operate in secrecy. But Pereira went all over the world to track down reels of material and documents that illustrate “how Stroessner dominated all aspects of Paraguayan life, rendering many ordinary people apparently incapable of thinking for themselves,” as I wrote in a piece in March after seeing the film at the Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival in Greece. “He created a strongman’s cult of personality and surrounded himself with an obsequious court (parallels to Trump 2.0 may leap to mind, but that’s outside the scope of this documentary).”\n\nIt’s what Pereira does with the archive that makes this documentary so remarkable. He doesn’t present it as some sort of objective record but interrogates the footage. He achieves that through sound design that reduces ambient noise to telling details; at other moments, he reverses the archive video so that, for example, soldiers march backward instead of forwards. This technique encourages us as viewers to deconstruct, along with Pereira, the narrative architecture of an authoritarian system – to see how it uses symbols to impose and maintain power. At a time when right-wing movements are gaining around the world, this film shows us what to look for as such regimes try to dominate their countries and eliminate dissent.\n\nUnder the Flags, the Sun has played at many film festivals. We will update with any distribution details.\n\nJuanjo Pereira’s film dovetails with another of my favorite documentaries of the year, Norita, directed by Jayson McNamara and Andrea Carbonatto Tortonese. It tells the story of Nora “Norita” Cortiñas, an Argentinian woman who led a quiet life disengaged from politics until her eldest son, Gustavo, a left-wing activist, was swept up and disappeared by the right-wing military junta of Videla in April 1977. Norita co-founded the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo – the extraordinary group of women who confronted the regime over the disappearance of their children. Some of the Mothers were in turn seized by agents of the government and disappeared themselves, including one woman who had fled Stroessner’s Paraguay.\n\nMy Pick No. 10\n\nFor my 10th and final selection, I jointly recognize several films as Defenders of Democracy — at a time when government by and for the people faces extreme threats in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nApocalypse in the Tropics , Petra Costa’s compelling analysis of the rise of Christian nationalism in Brazil. The director shows how a subset of evangelicals has weaponized the Book of Revelations, embracing an image of an armed and vengeful Jesus who commands them to take over the government and all sectors of civic and religious life. The film contains urgent lessons for anyone unaware of the parallel rise of Christian nationalism in the U.S.\n\n, Petra Costa’s compelling analysis of the rise of Christian nationalism in Brazil.

The film contains urgent lessons for anyone unaware of the parallel rise of Christian nationalism in the U.S. Orwell: 2+2=5 , Raoul Peck’s documentary about the late British author of 1984 examines not just the Herculean effort it took for George Orwell to finish that novel as he suffered the end stages of tuberculosis, but how his work speaks to today. We are in a time of Newspeak when a Vladimir Putin describes his attack on Ukraine as a “special military operation” and a Donald Trump tries to rewrite January 6 by calling it a “day of love.”\n\n, Raoul Peck’s documentary about the late British author of 1984 examines not just the Herculean effort it took for George Orwell to finish that novel as he suffered the end stages of tuberculosis, but how his work speaks to today.

The investigative journalist has broken some of the most important stories of the past 50+ years, including the My Lai Massacre and the Abu Ghraib scandal. His work and that of others of a similar stripe holds government officials accountable for criminal and sometimes barbaric acts even as they try to cover them up (hence the film’s title). The documentary serves as a reminder that a free press is synonymous with democracy and explains why dictators across the globe make squashing independent news media a top priority.\n\n, the film directed by Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus that documents the career of reporter Seymour Hersh.

More than 96,000 users reviewed “The Bridge” on IMDb, while most other episodes this season have been rated by fewer than 50,000 people.\n\nElon Musk, who often gripes about movies and TV shows going “woke,” said “the culture is changing” in response to a post on X claiming that fans were “criticizing a character for coming out as homosexual.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“It’s completely unnecessary and forced on audiences who just want to enjoy some basic sci-fi,” Musk wrote.\n\nReview bombing from so-called “toxic fandom” is nothing new. Actors in big franchises — from “Star Wars” to “Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” to “Bridgerton” — have long had to battle torrents of racism, sexism and homophobia on social media. Hollywood studios have even launched specialized focus group testing and begun training their actors in a social media boot camp to get ahead of it.\n\nStill, many “Stranger Things” viewers clarified that they took no issue with Will’s sexuality, which has been alluded to since the first season. Rather, they criticized the show’s clunky exposition, slow-moving plot and half-baked writing.\n\nVariety chief TV critic Alison Herman, for one, argued that the show declined to “enrich its characters as they age” and “remains primarily pastiche, so indebted to inherited archetypes (mad scientist, reformed bully) and references (The Clash, Peanut Butter Boppers) that its main cultural impact comes from extratextual elements like casting and the ascendance of Netflix.”\n\nDaniel D’Addario, Variety‘s chief correspondent, wrote that Will’s speech “strikes an emotional chord,” as it reflects actor Schnapp’s own coming out process. From his column: “This, a pivotal character opening up about being queer on a show as massive as ‘Stranger Things,’ feels seismic — and, oddly, like the culmination of a very long journey.”\n\nIn an interview about the episode, Schnapp told Variety he was “in tears” when he first read the scene, which he filmed over the span of nearly 24 hours. “The cast was so gracious. I’ll never forget how supportive they were on that day and how respectful and giving they were to me,” he said.\n\nThe final episode of “Stranger Things” debuts on Netflix and in theaters on Dec. 31.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 20:30:10 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T20:30:58.281443"}

Very disappointing to learn.”\n\nIt was not surprising that Roan would have at least some praise for Bardot, having name-checked her in the very first line of one of her most famous songs, “Red Wine Supernova,” which begins with the lyric: “She was a playboy, Brigitte Bardot / She showed me things I didn’t know.” Still, it did come as a shock to some Roan devotees that she did not qualify that with a disavowal or at least acknowledgement of the extremely polarizing social views Bardot became most famous for later in life. Roan’s followup message pleaded ignorance of what some fans would consider Bardot’s dark side.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Rest in peace Ms. Bardot,” Roan’s initial message on Sunday read. “She was my inspiration for red wine supernova.”\n\nBardot’s reputation has been fractured in the decades following her 1960s peak as a cinematic sex symbol who also appeared in art films like “Contempt.” Outside of the realm of films, some remember her best for her animal activism and founding the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in the 1980s to advocate for animal rights. Others know her primarily for her statements against Muslims in European life, as Bardot was convicted five times in France on charges of inciting racial hatred.\n\nWrote Le Monde in a remembrance of Bardot Monday: “Brigitte Bardot, the actress, was known for ‘Le Mépris (Contempt)’; Bardot, the political figure, embodied racial hatred. Convicted five times for inciting racial hatred, Bardot remained, for three decades, an exception in French culture – the only celebrity to openly defend the far right.”\n\nLe Monde further said, “Her advocacy for animals went hand in hand with her Islamophobia.” Bardot first raised her voice to write a letter about animal slaughter on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Kebir, then eventually took that objection much further. “They slaughter women and children, our monks, our civil servants, our tourists and our sheep, one day they’ll slaughter us, and we’ll have deserved it,” she wrote in foreseeing a “Muslim France.”\n\nBardot had been married since the 1990s to Bernard d’Ormale, who served as adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the far-right Front National.\n\nRoan is far from the only popular singer to have called out Bardot in song, as an iconic reference, if not necessarily a deeply personal one. Olivia Rodrigo compared the subject of her song “Lacy” to “Bardot incarnate.” Going all the way back to 1963, Bob Dylan wrote the lines on his “Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan” album: “Well, my telephone rang it would not stop / It’s President Kennedy callin’ me up / He said, My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow? / I said my friend, John, Brigitte Bardot…”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 20:12:43 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T20:30:58.640745"}

According to People magazine, Community [&#8230;]", "content": "The upcoming – and authorized – CNN documentary I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not is still days away from its January 1 premiere even as it continues to make news. The latest: New details about the notorious 2012 incident that led to Chase’s sudden departure from the hit sitcom Community.\n\nAccording to People magazine, Community director Jay Chandrasekhar says in the new doc that Chase had an on-set “meltdown” following the incident in which the former SNL cast member apparently used the N-word in a conversation with co-star Yvette Nicole Brown.\n\nWhile he didn’t actually hear the conversation between the two actors, Chandrasekhar says in the doc that he “was there, directing, the night that Chevy Chase got fired from Community.” Chandrasekhar says the event stemmed from a scripted “blackface” hand puppet bit involving Chase’s Community character Pierce Hawthorne.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nChase, as detailed in a Deadline report at the time, was unhappy with his character’s racist development, and said something along the lines that soon the writers would be having him say the N-word. Only he didn’t say “N-word.”\n\nIn the CNN film, Chandrasekhar, according to People, says, “I know that there was a history between [Chase and Brown] around race, and she got up and stormed out of there. Chevy storms off, so the producer is like, ‘We need Yvette in the scene, right?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, she’s in the next scene.’ And he goes, ‘Well, she won’t come out unless Chevy apologizes to her.’ ”\n\nChandrasekhar said Chase then claimed he “didn’t say anything.”\n\n“He goes, ‘You know, me and Richard Pryor, I used to call Richard Pryor the N-word, and he used to call me The Honky, and we loved each other.’ And I’m like, ‘I know, man, I love that bit.’ I said, ‘You know, can we just have a little apology?’ He goes, ‘For what?’”\n\nWhen word about the incident soon leaked to the press, Chase, according to Chandrasekhar, had a “full meltdown.” The director says Chase came “storming onto the set, and he goes, ‘Who f*cked me over?’ … ‘My career is ruined! I’m ruined!’ Like, it’s a full meltdown. ‘F*ck all of you!’ ”\n\nAdds Chandrasekhar, “And I’m like, ‘Alright, let’s shoot the scene.’ He never ended up coming back after that.”\n\nWhile Chase later apologized, he left Community after 2013’s Season 4 (save for one brief appearances in 2014).\n\nChandrasekhar also recalls a rather ugly real-life scene during a Community wrap party. “It was out in the open that Chevy Chase was a little difficult on Community, and I’m being nice,” the director says. “People were talking about it, enough that Dan did that thing at the wrap party.”\n\n“That thing” was when Community creator and director Dan Harmon allegedly got party guests to chant “F*ck you, Chevy!” as the actor walked in. That, in turn, led to Chase’s leaked profanity-laden voicemail directed at Harmon.\n\nAs People reports, Chase’s daughter Caley Chase recalls the moment for the documentary (both she and mother Jayni Chase were in attendance). “My dad was super excited to bring me and my mom to the wrap party,” Caley Chase, now 40, says. “We walk in, Dan, he had had some drinks. He had gotten the whole cast and crew to yell, ‘F*ck you, Chevy!’ ‘F*ck you, Chevy!’ “\n\nCaley continues, “I’m there, he’s showing his daughter, like, ‘This is the show I did,’ and we walk in to ‘F*ck you, Chevy!’ That’s rough.

Boseman&#8217;s [&#8230;]", "content": "Ryan Coogler appeared on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast amid his ongoing awards season press tour for “Sinners” and revealed the original story plans for “Black Panther 2.” The director was well into development on the sequel to his Oscar-winning 2018 blockbuster when lead actor Chadwick Boseman died in August 2020 from colon cancer. Boseman’s tragic passing forced Coogler to completely overhaul the sequel into what would become 2022’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”\n\nMarvel fans wondering what Coogler originally planned for Boseman’s return finally have an answer as Coogler told “Happy Sad Confused” podcast host Josh Horowitz that his original “Black Panther 2” script focused on an adventure between Boseman’s T’Challa and the character’s 8-year-old son. Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta in “Wakanda Forever,” was still the main villain.\n\n“The big thing with the script was a thing called the Ritual of 8 where a prince is 8 years old, he must spend 8 days in the bush with his father,” Coogler said. “The rule is for those 8 days the prince can ask the father any question and the father must answer. In the course of those 8 days, Namor launches an attack… he had to deal with someone who’s insanely dangerous but because of this ritual, his son had to be joined at his hip the whole time or else they’d violate this ritual that had never been broken. It was insane. Chadwick was going to kill it, but life goes as it goes.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCoogler confirmed that he finished this version of the “Black Panther 2” script and reached out to Boseman to read it, but “he was too sick” to do so.\n\n“He was at a place where it wasn’t going to happen,” the director added. “Our relationship was very interesting. He meant a lot of me but I found out after his passing from his family and his friends about how much I meant to him. That fucked me up pretty good. I wonder if he knew how much he meant to me. I did wonder… But I loved that script. I put so much into that version of the movie because I felt like I had gotten to know Chadwick as a performer. I threw a lot at him in the first ‘Panther’ but I realized I was just scratching the surface. It was a 180-page draft.”\n\nCoogler also revealed that he originally wanted to use Kraven the Hunter in the first “Black Panther” movie, but he was blocked from doing so, as the character is owned by Sony and not Disney.\n\n“[I] wanted to base it on the Christopher Priest run of ‘Panther,’ and his run starts with Panther and Kraven in the kitchen,” Coogler said. “That’s the first thing. It’s Ross, Panther and Kraven fighting in the kitchen.”\n\n“I’m a big Spider-Man fan, especially ‘Spider-Man: The Animated Series.’ Kraven is in that. He’s also great in the books,” Coogler continued. “I was like, ‘Yo, can I have Kraven in the movie?’ They were like, ‘We don’t think so, but let us check.’ So, they hit Sony, and Sony was like, ‘Absolutely not.’ They came back to me like, ‘Yo, we can’t do it.’ So, I was like, ‘Okay.’”\n\nSony would ultimately end up making its own “Kraven the Hunter” movie with director J.C. Chandor and actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the title role, although it was a box office dud with $62 million worldwide in December 2024.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of “Sinners,” Coogler is now in development on a third “Black Panther” movie at Marvel Studios.\n\nWatch his full interview on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in the video below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:02:53 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T21:24:56.748239"}

While romance series have broken through at the award show recently — see “Nobody Wants This,” which broke through with three nods for its first season — this adaptation will not get the same treatement.\n\n“Heated Rivalry” is fully funded by Canadian company Bell Media, Crave’s parent company. The 2024-25 Emmy rules state that a “foreign television production is ineligible unless it is the result of a co-production (both financially and creatively) betwen U.S. and foreign partners, which precedes the start of production, and with a purpose to be shown on U.S. television.” While the Television Academy hasn’t yet released the 2025-26 rulebook, it’s unlikely any changes to this rule will be made.\n\n“Heated Rivalry” was originally set for 2026, but was then moved up by Crave with a hope to get more viewers over the holidays. It worked. But HBO Max didn’t come on until after Season 1 was finished, far too late to become a co-financier or producer — which meant they had no creative say. Instead, they serve solely as the U.S. distributor.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAnd that will remain for Season 2, according to HBO content chairman and CEO Casey Bloys.\n\n“We’re not going to be involved,” Bloys recently told Variety. “I think the last thing the show needs is people meddling in what works. So, I don’t feel any need to weigh in. Clearly, they’ve got a good sense of the show and what works. I will be excited to receive my episodes, and highlight them on HBO Max.”\n\nBloys was introduced to the show by Jason Butler, an HBO exec who acquired the show for HBO Max in Australia. Butler called Bloys in early November, and asked if he’d want it for U.S. He sent over the episodes and three days later, they began negotiating.\n\n“It was an easy and very quick ‘yes.’ Obviously, I’m a gay man, so I had a sense that it might make some waves,” he said. “I thought it was very well done. To tell you the truth, I was surprised that it was even available, because this was about three weeks before it aired.”\n\nBloys added that he was “very impressed” by the afforadability of the acquisition. “I don’t know their budgets, but I’m very impressed with what they did based on the acquisition cost. This isn’t a huge tentpole budget that we’re looking at.”\n\nTierney added that he was thrilled HBO became the U.S. streaming home since HBO content is is licensed to Crave in Canada.\n\n“We were always like, ‘We’re trying to make premium smut here,’ and so we’re now premium smut on HBO!” said Tierney. “That would be the dream. But we’ve been doing this long enough to know that nothing guarantees you an audience anymore. There’s so much good TV out there, that to break through the noise feels like such a gift.”\n\nThe series, which tells the love story between two NHL star players — who are also enemies on the ice — became a massive hit for Crave and HBO Max following its November debut. It is now the top-rated non-animated acquired series on HBO Max since its 2020 launch. It is in the top five among all scripted debuts on HBO Max this year. In Canada, it’s Crave’s most watched original.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:39:55 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T21:43:10.224285"}

A tale of two enemy soldiers patrolling a militarized border from inside a common outpost, the movie’s fictitious premise gradually transforms, and eventually transcends the shortcomings of its broad political scope the more it leans into abstraction.\n\nThe film arrives with a bang, introducing the fragile ceasefire between its warring (though unnamed) desert nations via a smart split-screen prologue during its first five minutes. Amid pomp and circumstance, leaders on either side of a rickety fence stand on ceremony, inadvertently interrupting one another through microphone feedback, as the dueling images — each with their own jittery, handheld camera movements and unique color timing, one warm and one cool — swap places and subjects. This tongue-in-cheek flourish aestheticizes the point Hudson hammers home ad nauseam across 109 minutes, to vary degrees of success: these nations, despite their differing military garbs and traditions, may as well be one and the same.\n\nAlthough consistently amusing, “Straight Circle” is at its strongest when literalizing the blurred line between borders through this two-pronged visual approach, though it only takes this form for a few more minutes near the end. However, in the meantime, Hudson still plays alluring tricks, beginning with his casting. The story’s focus is, for the most part, a pair of soldiers with opposing allegiances, viewpoints, and ideologies. One of them, a bald, bespectacled man filled with jingoistic fervor, dons a large black beret and a white uniform, and enacts a showy, gestural salute that earns his countrymen the epithet of “slap heads.” The other, a raggedy, bearded civilian from his country’s military reserve, is less enthused, and often strips off his service greens and his Ottoman-style fez to smoke cigarettes and lounge in the sun. However, what viewers may not realize at first is that these characters are played by real-life twin brothers Elliott and Luke Tittensor (of “House of the Dragon” fame) respectively, imbuing the film’s sardonic goings on with an uncanny quality.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe made-up countries in question don’t seem to matter, which makes for a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows the film’s distinctly English characters to immediately make clear Hudson’s all-encompassing point about how, beyond our most outward and boisterous details, people are all the same, and we should just get along. Politically, “Straight Circle” has a tendency to play like a “Coexist” bumper sticker with all specificities stripped away, until real-world comparisons begin to hurt it. A tale such as this is bound to bring to mind existing equivalents,whether India and Pakistan’s ceremonial Wagah border, or the DMZ between North and South Korea, or numerous ongoing border disputes across the world, which stem from not only social and geopolitical specifics, but a history of western imperialism — and, in some cases, specifically British imperialism. The film’s British production, and its British filmmaker, can’t help but occupy a large section of the movie’s negative space, inviting questions about who and what exactly is being satirized (or perhaps patronized) in this tale of warring desert nations.\n\nHowever, despite the movie’s gaze verging on orientalist, “Straight Circle” slowly but surely disengages from all forms of reality, and becomes a far more absurd and anthropological study when an incoming dust storm disorients the characters and viewers alike. Beyond a point, both sides of the border become identical, just as the physical and psychological lines between both patrolmen begin to blur, resulting in surprisingly touching drama through personal anecdotes, sprinkled with surrealism, and performed with emotional gusto by its sibling leads, as they dig into what haunts and drives each character. The film is made even more inviting by composer Maxwell Sterling’s rapturous horns, and cinematographer Christopher Ripley’s vivid textures of the parched environment, rooting even the movie’s zaniest happenings in a visceral reality.\n\nThe less realistic the movie feels — in a geopolitical sense — the more human it becomes. This is perhaps Hudson’s greatest sleight of hand, and it transforms the initial weaknesses of “Straight Circle” into its most entertaining strengths. No one watching the film is likely to come away with a deeper understanding of military conflict, but there is, eventually, a wonderful psychology to the story, expressed through fleeting flourishes that are sorely missed once they’re cast aside. Perhaps it should’ve been stranger than it already is, but it’s a bold swing to begin with, and marks a fitting first chapter for Hudson, in what is sure to be an interesting career.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:55:44 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T22:26:06.653047"}

Kaplow constructed the crux of the Blue Moon story out of a series of correspondences between Hart and an unidentified Yale student named Elizabeth. The script grew out of the letters and Kaplow asked questions like, What if they met? What if Hart loved her? The action was also set in once place — the bar at Sardi’s, the famed restaurant in the New York theater district — which tightened the frame of the picture of a man who felt the culture he helped create was passing him by, trying for a glimmer of happiness with a girl he may have loved.\n\nMargaret Qualley plays Elizabeth, and Andrew Scott plays Rodgers (Scott won the Supporting Actor Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival where the film premiered). Bobby Cannavale plays the loyal Sardi’s bartender Eddie. Hawke and Scott both scooped up Gotham Awards nominations, while Hawke landed a Best Actor nom and the film a Best Picture nom from the Golden Globes.\n\nThe screenplay was recognized as the best of the year by the Chicago and St. Louis film critics groups.\n\nLinklater said he and Kaplow (and later Hawke, who was too young to play Hart when this project first surfaced) jell because they are “guys from another decade.”\n\n‘He’s a historian, he’s a romantic, he really likes to jump into these moments in history,” Linklater says of Kaplow. He called the resulting movie “a crazy, perverse idea, to see the triumph of this hit musical [Oklahoma!] but through the eyes of the old lyricist.”\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:23:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T22:26:07.051762"}

Chandrasekhar, who is best known for his work with the Broken Lizard comedy group, said the actor had a “meltdown” on set after an incident in which he used the N-word on set leaked to the press.\n\nThe alleged incident occurred between Chase and co-star Yvette Nicole Brown, with Chandrasekhar explaining: “I know that there was a history between [Chevy and Yvette] around race, and she got up and stormed out of there. Chevy storms off, so the producer is like, ‘We need Yvette in the scene, right?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, she’s in the next scene.’ And he goes, ‘Well, she won’t come out unless Chevy apologizes to her.’”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nChandrasekhar said Chevy eventually returned to the set but claimed he “didn’t say anything” to upset Brown, adding: “[Chevy] goes, ‘You know, me and Richard Pryor, I used to call Richard Pryor the N-word, and he used to call me The Honky, and we loved each other.’ And I’m like, ‘I know, man, I love that bit.’ I said, ‘You know, can we just have a little apology?’ He goes, ‘For what?’”\n\nWhatever was said by Chase on the “Community” set happened during a “blackface” hand puppet bit written for the comedian’s character, Pierce Hawthorne, Chandrasekhar said. The incident was later reported on by The Hollywood Reporter, who claimed Chase was “frustrated” with his character arc and used the N-word “when questioning the dialogue.” The report stressed that Chase did not use the racial slur directly at his Black co-stars Brown and Donald Glover, although both actors were reportedly on set at the time.\n\nChandrasekhar said that when production resumed after the THR story broke, Chase arrived on set and had a “full meltdown” as he came “storming onto the set, and he goes, ‘Who fucked me over?’ … My career is ruined! I’m ruined!’ Like, it’s a full meltdown. ‘Fuck all of you!’ And I’m like, ‘Alright, let’s shoot the scene.’ He never ended up coming back after that.”\n\nVariety has reached out to Chase’s representative for further comment.\n\nDonald Glover told The New Yorker in 2018 that Chase repeatedly made racist jokes on the “Community” set. According to the profile, Chase “often tried to disrupt” his scenes with Glover by making “racial cracks between takes,” one of which was the following: “People think you’re funnier because you’re Black.”\n\n“Chevy was the first to realize how immensely gifted Donald was, and the way he expressed his jealousy was to try to throw Donald off,” “Community” creator Dan Harmon said at the time. “I remember apologizing to Donald after a particularly rough night of Chevy’s non-P.C. verbiage, and Donald said, ‘I don’t even worry about it.’”\n\nGlover interpreted Chase’s racist cracks as the comedian “thrashing in the water,” adding, “I just saw Chevy as fighting time—a true artist has to be ok with his reign being over. I can’t help him if he’s thrashing in the water. But I know there’s a human in there somewhere—he’s almost too human.”\n\n\n\nChase told CBS Sunday Morning in 2022 that he “doesn’t give a crap” about headlines and former co-stars painting him as problematic on set, adding at the time: “I don’t give a crap. I am who I am. And I like who I am. I don’t care. And it’s part of me that I don’t care. And I’ve thought about that a lot. And I don’t know what to tell you, man. I just don’t care.”\n\nChase exited “Community” after Season 4 following the N-word incident and a public spat with Harmon over creative differences. Chandrasekhar says in the CNN documentary that “it was out in the open that Chevy Chase was a little difficult on ‘Community,’ and I’m being nice. People were talking about it, enough that Dan did that thing at the wrap party,” referring to when Harmon got party guests to chant “Fuck you, Chevy!”\n\n“My dad was super excited to bring me and my mom to the wrap party,” Chevy’s daughter Caley says in the documentary. “We walk in, Dan, he had had some drinks. He had gotten the whole cast and crew to yell, ‘Fuck you, Chevy!’ ‘Fuck you, Chevy!’ I’m there, he’s showing his daughter, like, ‘This is the show I did,’ and we walk in to ‘Fuck you, Chevy!’ That’s rough and mean.”\n\n“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” director Marina Zenovich told Variety that she tried to get more of Chase’s “Community” cast members and crew members to participate in the documntary but “every single person said no” because “there are things people don’t want to talk about.”\n\n“I ran into Dan Harmon at a screening of ‘Deaf President Now!’ and I got his number,” she added. “I was so excited. I thought it was going to happen but then he declined. I was so lucky to get Jay Chandrasekhar. He has such an amazing delivery and he was willing to go there. If Jay had said no, I would have been screwed.”\n\n“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” airs Jan. 1 on CNN.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:31:54 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T22:45:36.066482"}

Listen, there’s no justification for what he did that makes any sense in a compassionate society. It’s no different than people that were celebrating when Charlie Kirk got shot. It’s the same kind of thing.”\n\n“Imagine if Obama tweeted something about someone after they died in this way. That this person was a deranged person that hated Obama.” Rogan continued. “It just shows you how crazy it is, the way Trump thinks and talks.

It’s like why… if you say that privately that’s one thing, which is also crazy, but it’s so disappointing.”\n\nTrump made his statement on Reiner in a Truth Social post that read: “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\nTrump doubled down on his criticism of Reiner hours later when asked during a press conference about Republicans condemning his original statement. He responded: “Well, I wasn’t a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned… I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nThe U.S. president was widely condemned by Hollywood for his statements on Reiner. Josh Gad posted on Threads: “There is no low that is too low for this fucking psychopath. Rob Reiner was 1000 times the man you are and unlike you, he actually cared about the American people. Go paint your hand on your gold fucking toilet and destroy things like the White House. That’s what you do best.”\n\nJimmy Kimmel bashed Trump as “hateful and vile” for going after Reiner after such a tragic death. The late night host added: “What we need at a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental health care, is compassion and leadership. We did not get that from our president, because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense.”\n\nWhoopi Goldberg on “The View” condemned Trump and also every Republican staying silent on the matter by saying: “There’s no justification for him to have written what he wrote.

That’s on top of the 5-10 inches seen in many parts of the Southland last week.\n\nIf the forecast holds, it will be the first time rain has fallen on the floral procession since 2006.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nGiven that those storms saturated the ground in many areas, including Pasadena, authorities again are warning of possible mud and debris flows from the upcoming rain.\n\nParade officials say they are prepared for the deluge, with virtually every employee of the City of Pasadena working New Year’s Day. That includes tow trucks at the ready to haul off stalled floats. (In 2006, floats from the cities of Burbank and Sierra Madre, Disney and Trader Joe’s broke down.)\n\nAn estimated 800,000 people lined the streets for the event last year. The City of Pasadena issued a reminder today that “umbrellas are not permitted along the parade route because they block the view for others.”\n\nAdditionally, the road closures will be in effect, per Pasadena Transit:\n\nOn NYE, Routes 10, 20, 33, 40, 51/52 & 53 will detour starting at 6 PM until end of service (8 PM) to avoid Old Pasadena. Rt 51/52 will detour all day to avoid Rose Bowl area. On New Year’s Day Rt 33 will detour from 6 AM – 3:30 PM.\n\nAccording to The Weather Channel, there is a 77% chance of rain in Pasadena for New Year’s Eve and 98% on New Year’s Day — increasing the possibility of a soggy Rose Parade.\n\nNWS forecasters said people heading for the parade should expect to get wet. “The chances of a wet New Year’s parade, and including the night before when people came out before the parade, are extremely high,” forecasters said in a statement Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Rose Parade will be carried live locally on KTLA. Leeza Gibbons and Mark Steines are returning to co-host, with KTLA 5 Morning News anchor Chris Schauble reporting from the parade route. Live coverage will start at 6 a.m. PT.\n\nMagic Johnson is this year’s grand marshal.\n\nThe parade will also be streamed in its entirety on eight platforms: Christmas Plus, Dooya, FanDuel Sports Network, Fubo Sports Network, GFam+, Great American Pure Flix, Pluto TV and Samsung TV Plus. The livestream will include every one of the 85 floats as they make their way along the five-and-a-half-mile parade route\n\nFollowing the parade, the 112th Rose Bowl game will see No. 1 seed Indiana University Hoosiers (13-0) will play No. 9 seed Alabama Crimson Tide (11-3). It will be broadcast at 1 p.m. PT on ESPN.\n\n\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 23:49:23 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-29T23:57:36.479588"}

Facing literally dozens and dozens of civil suits across the nation, and a new sexual battery probe opened last month by the LA County Sheriff’s department, Combs was sentenced to 30 months in early October\n\nWith time served taken into account, the Federal Bureau of Prisons had him originally set to be let out on May 8, 2028, if there were no incidents or citations. Then, once Combs was transferred to the far cushier Garden State facility, he was set to be released on June 4, 2028.\n\nNow, unless his fast-tracked appeal proves a winner, Diddy is getting out on May 25, 2028, according to the latest info from the FBoP.\n\nNo reason was given for this latest change and why just over a week was shaved off Combs’ time in the joint. Fact is, like so many things in life, it sometimes takes authorities a bit of time to get the math correct in incarceration matters for both high-profile convicts and regular ole bad guys.\n\nEven before the four-part Alexandria Stapleton-directed Reckoning was launched on the global streamer on December 2, lawyers for Diddy tried to have it shut down. Calling Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson EP’d The Reckoning a “shameful hit piece,” that December 1 cease and desist letter proclaimed the footage of Combs in a NYC hotel rooming ranting at his defense lawyers was “stolen” and illegally obtained.\n\nAccusing co-CEO Sarandos of “corporate retribution” from allegedly being rebuffed by Combs on a 2023 docu project, the letter went on to say: “As you are undoubtedly aware, Mr. Combs has not hesitated to take legal action against media entities and others who violate his rights, and he will not hesitate to do so against Netflix.”\n\nA scene from Sean Combs: The Reckoning Credit: Netflix Netflix\n\nEarlier this month, the streamer offered its own version of events to what the often hyperbolic Combs claimed was really going on. “The project has no ties to any past conversations between Sean Combs and Netflix,” a spokesperson for the streamer said of Sarandos and Diddy’s professional relationship and any other docu project. “The footage of Combs leading up to his indictment and arrest were legally obtained. This is not a hit piece or an act of retribution. Curtis Jackson is an executive producer but does not have creative control. No one was paid to participate.”\n\nPerhaps unintentionally providing some degree of legal coverage to Netflix, so-called “Sean Combs’ documentarian” Michael Oberlies on December 10 offered up how the hotel footage ended up in The Reckoning. “The footage in question was not released by me or anyone authorized to handle Sean Combs’ materials; it was by a third party who covered for me for three days while I was out of state,” he said.\n\nIt should be noted that Netflix has been in a similar situation before over what was called stolen footage and the streamer came up the winner in court. Attempts in 2022 by members of orgasmic meditation organization OneTaste to shut down the docu Orgasm Inc over “misappropriated” footage failed. The streamer successfully argued in LA Superior Court that they had come across the video of training session legally and that a lot of what Orgasm Inc showed, with faces blurred, was out in public already.\n\nUndoubtedly with the OneTaste case in mind, Combs’ The Reckoning lawyers must be weighing the odds of court victory with that precedent. Certainly, the stakes that are so much lower now the well watched douseries has been online almost a month.\n\nOn a parallel track, Diddy’s attorneys in his much hyped and already expedited appeal finally got around to putting an official document in the court docket just before Christmas. Trashing trial judge Arun Subramanian for supposedly acting like the “thirteenth juror,” the filing wants the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to spring Combs outta free one way or another ASAP.\n\n“If this Court does not overturn Combs’s conviction, it should release him immediately and instruct the district court to resentence him only for the conduct of which he was convicted,” the Alexandra Shapiro signed 84-page appeal says.\n\nEven though Combs admitted in the opening days of his trial in May that he had a serious drug problem and inflicted domestic abuse upon various women and men in his circle, the appeal lays it on thick and describes the Grammy winner as “an extraordinarily successful self-made businessman, artist, and philanthropist, and one of the most accomplished black men in this country.”\n\nLet’s see if the same language is used in a lawsuit against Netflix and its brass, if it ever happens.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:40:08 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T02:21:58.524173"}

Panahi is legally embattled at home for his outspoken criticisms of the government. The thriller is instead representing France. The other title with that shared premise is “Cause of Death: Unknown,” Iran’s official entry, by writer-director Ali Zarnegar, a filmmaking debut from a seasoned screenwriter which could have garnered him deserved international attention under a different set of circumstances, but did not make the category’s shortlist.\n\nThough inevitably overshadowed, “Cause of Death: Unknown” is by no means a toothless state-sanctioned selection, which becomes more of a surprise as it reveals itself to be a politically laced narrative at every turn and in the backstory of each of the characters in the top-notch ensemble — albeit in a less overt manner than in Panahi’s more confrontational project.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWith a stern demeanor, Ahmad (Banipal Shoomoon), a mustachioed man, tries to soothe a younger guy crying inside a car in the opening scene. Later, while riding in a taxi van across an arid landscape, Ahmad will disclose that he spent time in prison. Bits of piecemeal information about each of the passengers emerge, the deeper they become involved in a situation that could land them all behind bars.\n\nThe driver, Majid (Ali Mohammad Radmanesh), has romantic feelings for his copilot, Najveh (Zakieh Behbahani), a deaf woman in a relationship with a domestic abuser. Naser (Alireza Sani Far), a man whose father was a mortician, carries a suitcase that he will eventually barter for money. Sitting in the back are Peyman (Soheil Bavi) and Bahar (Neda Jebreili), a young couple seeking to leave the country illegally because his political activism has put him at risk of apprehension. Traveling with them is Esmaeil (Reza Amouzad), a down-on-his-luck, desperate man whose tattered clothes and shoes betray he’s in the clutches of near-abject poverty.\n\nThere’s one more passenger on board, a man asleep who falls from his seat when Majid abruptly brakes early in the trip. The unplanned stop marks a watershed in their collective journey. A large sum of money enters the picture, but so does a dead body they have to deal with. Zarnegar operates with a superbly calibrated screenplay. He must tread lightly when approaching controversial subjects in his homeland or face the fate of Panahi (recently sentenced to a year in prison and banned from leaving Iran). The exasperated traveler’s exchanges, often cautiously accusatory, play out as if they are all testing how potently they can imply that the others want to keep the cash for themselves. The taut scenes provide the actors with a playing field to shine individually in heated arguments, sobering moments of empathy and painfully honest talks about what comes after a life-altering event.\n\nTheir decision on how to proceed must be made before reaching a checkpoint. Both lying and telling the truth about what happened could land them in similar trouble. If they all can agree on something, it is their distrust of institutions. That they get accosted halfway through by police officers who treat them with suspicion despite not knowing what they hide proves their hesitation. In turn, the stacks of dollar bills offer a chance that none of them thought possible. Naser, for example, could pay for his wife’s medical treatments. Their respective sorrows could be, if not erased entirely, at least diminished. When the men discuss the exchange rate between the U.S. currency and the Iranian toman, the precariousness of their realities is presented in a materially concrete way.\n\nAgainst the blank backgrounds in the middle of nowhere, cinematographer Davood Malek Hosseini can concentrate on the most notable elevations in sight: the sulking faces of these men and women who wish to uphold their honor, at least in front of the others, but who are tempted to act selfishly, facing a moral conundrum while in need. The causes of their affliction are not only known but hovering over them, and they all lead back to those in power and their handling of the country. The explicit mention of the death penalty as the source of one passenger’s misery, and their need for blood money — a possibility for everyday citizens — as well as Peyman’s youthful rage against the injustices forcing him to flee, feel definitely charged with defiance, even if measured.\n\nIn the end, the only witness to their choices is the sand that will hide their secret and one another’s consciences. In the tradition of Panahi, Asghar Farhadi, Mohammad Rasoulof and other Iranian filmmakers whose stories hinge on impossible tests of morality under unimaginable sociopolitical constraints, Zarnegar delivers a gut-punch of an ending that renders whatever modicum of hope they’d attained null. Their win can only come at the expense of someone else’s suffering.

It is also well known that she confronted Brand during Roast Battle, with Deadline reporting the news in 2023 after The Times, Sunday Times, and Channel 4 published a joint investigation into his alleged misconduct.\n\nBrand has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. In May, he pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, indecent assault, and sexual assault. In a social media post, the Forgetting Sarah Marshall star said he was “grateful” for the opportunity to defend himself during a trial in 2026. Earlier this month, Brand was charged with two further offences: one of rape and another of sexual assault. He is due to appear in Westminster Magistrates’ Court on January 20 to face the charges.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDuring her Sky stand-up special, Ryan said: “I was invited on a panel show, and I was so excited to do it, but then I found out that if I went on, I would be sat next to a man whom I firmly believe, but can’t prove to be a c***. And that’s the lawyer’s choice of words, not mine.”\n\nShe continued: “Initially, I turned the job down, and then I thought: well, he’ll be there in his unnecessarily tight jeans, won’t he? He’ll be there, finger-banging Tucker Carlson or sucking off a Tibetan monk for views, whatever he does now … I thought I will go on the show, and I made a moral decision.”\n\nHer decision was that she would confront Brand and make jokes about his alleged reputation, “but in a fun way.” She recalled two gags she made about Brand, neither of which made the final edit when Roast Battle screened in the UK in 2018.\n\nRyan said Brand was “fine with it for a while, until eventually he had a hissy fit and threatened to quit the show.” She continued: “The channel got upset. They didn’t want him to leave, and they issued him a new contract, which he waltzed into my dressing room and threw under my nose the next day. He said: ‘Look, you’re not allowed to be mean to me anymore, because I don’t consent.’”\n\nRyan added that she had to “be nice” following Comedy Central’s intervention on the show, produced by Fulwell Entertainment. Paramount declined to comment. Ryan and Brand were approached for comment.\n\nBrand left Roast Battle after Season 1 and was replaced by Jonathan Ross. Based on the U.S. show Jeff Ross Presents Roast Battle, Comedy Central‘s format is predicated on comedians making jokes at each other’s expense, with judges — which included Brand and Ryan — considered to be fair game.\n\nRyan has previously spoken about her experience on Roast Battle in an appearance on BBC series Louis Theroux Interviews... in 2022. Again, she did not name Brand or the show, but went viral for her allegations — something she reflected on in her First Born Daughter special.\n\n“I was so excited to be interviewed by him, and I maybe shouldn’t have done that interview, because I have a disorder where if you ask me a question, I will tell you the answer,” she joked. “What’s the worst that could happen if I talk to Louis Theroux about it? A Times exposé, a Channel 4 documentary?”\n\nRyan continued: “It’s awkward now, because there is someone in the UK who’s been officially charged with an offense, and when that happens, you’re not allowed to slag them off anymore.

The franchise’s films have topped Spanish film charts in five of the last seven years.\n\n“It’s been a frustrating year. Looking at first half results, which were up 3% on 2024, everything pointed to 2025 either being up or at least flat on 2024.

They were accompanied by straight family fare, both film strains playing off virtual filmmaking: “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” “A Minecraft Movie,” “Zootopia 2,” “How to Train Your Dragon,” “Mufasa, The Lion King” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” all made Spain’s 2025 Top 10, according to Comscore Movies provisional estimates through Dec. 29.\n\nNo U.S. movie, however, made the spectacular €45.5 million ($47.3 million) gross for “Inside Out 2” in 2024 in Spain, the second best result for any movie in the country since “Spanish Affair” in 2014.\n\nOn the positive side for Spain, four upscale auteur titles made the national Top 10, led by Alejandro Amenábar’s “The Captive” (€5.3 million: $6.2 million).\n\nMost eye-catching, however, was the €3.9 million “($4.6 million) for Alauda Ruiz de Azúa’s San Sebastián top winner “Sundays” and €2.9 million ($3.4 million) box office for Cannes Jury Prize laureate “Sirāt,” now shortlisted for the International Feature Oscar, both showing how Movistar Plus+’s strategy of creating auteur event movies can pay dividends in theatrical results.\n\nPacked with potential U.S. animation and live-action behemoths, as Gower Street Analytics has observed, 2026 should be the highest-grossing global year since 2019. “Should,” however, is sometimes a sad word when talking about box office, not only in Spain.\n\nSpain Top 10 Highest-Grossing Films, 2025\n\n1. “Lilo & Stitch,” Walt Disney, May 23, €24.70 million ($29.14 million)\n\n2. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” Universal, July 2, €18.80 million ($22.18 million)\n\n3. “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Walt Disney, Dec. 19, €16.58 million ($19.56 million)\n\n4. “A Minecraft Movie,” Warner Bros, April 4, €16.03 million ($18.91 million)\n\n5. “Zootopia 2,” Walt Disney, Nov. 28, €13.75 million ($16.22 million)\n\n6. “How to Train Your Dragon,” Universal, June 12, €14.76 million ($17.41 million)\n\n7. “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” Walt Disney, Sep. 5, €13.63 million ($16.08 million)\n\n8. “Father There Is Only One 5,” Sony, June 26, €13.40 million ($15.81 million)\n\n9. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” Walt Disney, Dec. 20, 2024, €11.33 million ($13.36 million)\n\n10. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” Walt Disney, July 24, €9.48 million ($ million)\n\nSpain’s Top 10 Spanish Highest-Grossing Films, 2025\n\n1. “Father There Is Only One 5,” Sony, June 26, €13.40 million ($15.81 million)\n\n2. “The Captive,” Walt Disney, Sep. 12, €5.28 million ($6.23 million)\n\n3. “Sundays,” Bteam Pictures, Oct. 24, €3.92 million ($4.62 million)\n\n4. “Wolfgang,” Universal, March 14, €3.97 million ($4.68 million)\n\n5. “La cena,” A Contracorriente, Oct. 17, €3.70 million ($4.36 million)\n\n6. “El casoplón,” Walt Disney, April 16, €3.31 million ($3.90 million)\n\n7. “Un funeral de locos,” Sony, April 11, €3.02 million ($3.56 million)\n\n8. “Sirāt,” Bteam Pictures, June 6, €2.89 million ($3.41 million)\n\n9. “Sin cobertura,” Sony, Aug. 22, €2.92 million ($3.44 million)\n\n10. “Romería,” Elastica, Sep. 5, €1.78 million ($2.10 million)\n\nLorena Jaramillo contributed to this article.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:05:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T13:01:58.977119"}

Microdramas, anime and K-content were buzzwords on everyone’s lips this year, as Squid Game once again set records for Netflix and KPop Demon Hunter got the world singing. Theatrical remains challenged globally, but there were also notable successes in the region, some of which will continue into 2026. China’s box office bounced back and Indonesia made hay with animation Jumbo. Meanwhile, Japan saw record numbers for a live action film. Below, we identify six trends in the Asia Pacific region to watch out for this coming year.\n\nJapan’s Moment To Continue\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nA moment is probably underplaying it a little. Japan has long been a cultural tastemaker around the world through the likes of One Piece and Studio Ghibli’s canon, but with Oscar contender Kokuho grossing a domestic live action record ¥18.2B ($117M) and Crunchyroll anime movie Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle becoming the biggest ever Japanese film at the box office last year with nearly $780M globally, the country feels hotter than ever. Meanwhile, the influence of Ghibli and anime on the likes of Neon’s Oscar hopeful Arco are clear to see. Keith Le Goy, sales and networks supremo at Crunchyroll’s Japanese-owned parent Sony, has even predicted anime will replace Marvel and D.C. as the key source of IP for films and TV shows in the future. Keep an eye on Godzilla Minus One outfit Toho’s new UK outpost, too. It’ll be fascinating to see how that evolves and whether the company expands further west than London.\n\nWebnovels Craze Isn’t Going Anywhere\n\nMercedes Ron’s ‘ Culpa Nuestra Prime Video\n\nThere’s a very good chance the next global breakout will emerge from the region’s flourishing digital medium, webnovels. Hailing from the Korean cultural wave, webcomic and webnovel platforms allow readers around the world to view highly-stylized stories on their phones, computers and tablets – for a price. Wattpadd, in particular, has proven fertile ground for TV, film or podcast adaptations, so expect more aggressive marketing of the platform’s biggest titles. Consider Prime Video’s ultra-popular Culpables movie trilogy first found success on Wattpadd, the romance-led reading app that’s part of South Korean-American platform Webtoon. The novels’ author, Mercedes Ron, is now one of the hottest creators on the planet with a major Amazon deal locked in place.\n\n‘KPop Demon’ Sequels\n\n‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Netflix\n\nKPop Demon Hunters was this year’s cultural mega-hit for kids. The Netflix pic from Korean-Canadian writer Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans had children (and their parents) around the world singing “Up, up, up!” at the top of their lungs — song Golden has amassed more than 950M views on Youtube. At the most recent count, the movie itself had wracked up 500 million streaming views, making it easily Netflix’s most-watched original title. A sequel is planned for 2029, but in today’s million-miles-an-hour world, producer Sony and Netflix will surely have to fill the gap with other entries or spinoffs (a musical has been speculated) in the meantime or risk others taking its space in the cultural zeitgeist. Merchandising is moving quickly with toys, costumes and yoto cards all in demand. More broadly, K Pop continues to cut a global swathe, with multiple bands still in vogue and the subject inspiring upcoming movies for Paramount and starry indie pic Perfect Girl.\n\nAustralia‘s Streaming Market Heating Up\n\nGlobal streamers are facing a new reality in Australia after hotly-debated content quotas were ratified, ordering them to spend 10% of their total Australian expenditure – or 7.5% of their revenues – on local originals. Producers hope the rules will guarantee business in a fast-growing streaming market and reduce reliance on overseas productions to keep their doors open, but it’s not yet known if Netflix, HBO Max and co will get in the spirit of things or begin pulling back. In other countries with levies and similar diktats, streamers have shown caution, but their local ambitions may supersede reservations – Australia has provided hits such as The Artful Dodger, Colin From Accounts and The Newsreader in recent years. The market continues to be a fertile ground for foreign shoots and local producing, directing and acting talent. Established players such as Bruna Papandrea and See-Saw continue to generate buzzy local titles for streamers and broadcasters alike. Amazon’s brilliant The Narrow Road To The Deep North scored a Golden Globe nomination but probably didn’t get the attention it deserved in the U.S. Meanwhile, Danny and Michael Philippou (Talk To Me), Kiah Roache-Turner (Beast Of War), Charles Williams (Inside) and Gabrielle Brady (The Wolves Always Come at Night) are among the next gen of buzzed about Australian filmmakers.\n\nSocial Media Blocks\n\nAustralia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese Getty Images\n\nWe’re staying in Australia, which has become a uniquely interesting place for internet-related matters. Though their parents might be rejoicing, the country’s under 16s may be suffering social-media separation anxiety after a law to block their access came into being – so much so that a pair of teenagers and the Digital Freedom Project are suing the government, claiming the law infringes free speech and is unconstitutional. Since the rules kicked in on December 10, major platforms have primarily abided, though Reddit is taking its issues legal and Australian media reports Google has threatened to sue. If the law proves successful (and anecdotally so many we’ve spoken to are in favour of it), you can assume some other governments will look into replicating Australia’s measures as concerns over social media’s corrosive impact on young people continue to grow.\n\nNew Players In Animation\n\n‘Jumbo’ Visinema Studios\n\nIn April, Indonesian animated film Jumbo became the highest-grossing Southeast Asian animation of all time. The unexpected breakout hit sat alongside Ne Zha 2 — the Chinese mega-smash that booked well over $2B at the global box office (and helped propel China’s box office to $7BN+ for 2025, more than 20% ahead of 2024) — as reminders that animation in Asia’s isn’t solely the domain of Japan and Korea, as it sometimes seems. Animation financing is challenged in much of Asia – the same is true for most countries around the world – but the team at Jumbo producer Visinema Studios wants the film about an orphaned boy who inherits a magical storybook to act as the springboard for a new power player in the region. With a population nearing 300 million, the country has the potential to kick on. The government is currently exploring the viability of incentives for film and TV as it looks to strengthen the creative economy, and it is preparing a new film financing mechanism aimed at protecting intellectual property.\n\nAndreas Wiseman contributed to this report.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:40:19 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T13:01:59.413172"}

Since 2001 when Spain first obliged local networks to invest 5% of revenues in European films and 60% of that in national productions, its two free-to-air TV operators, Atresmedia and Mediaset España, have not only become major production partners on a substantial number of the most significant films made this century in Spain via Atresmedia Cine and Telecinco Cinema but their network parents have put their weighty marketing muscle behind the movies.\n\nThe result has been to update for the better Spanish audiences’ view of local movies, dismissed since the Spanish Civil War through the ‘60s as “españoladas” – movies whose local reference and relevance did not compensate for second-rate production standards.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nEven in a streaming service world, broadcast networks’ investment and marketing punch still count. Over 2025, Atresmedia Cine productions punched €25 million ($29.5 million) at Spain’s box office, accounting for an over 30% share of Spanish films’ total annual theatrical gross, it announced Dec. 24.\n\nThat’s thanks in large part to an ongoing production alliance with Bowfinger International Pictures, headed by Santiago Segura and producer María Luisa Gutiérrez, behind “Father There Is Only One 5,” which scored €13.4 million ($15.8 million) for distributor Sony in 2025 in Spain, by far the biggest box office trawl for any Spanish film.\n\nThe final instalment of the numerous family saga co-written and directed by and starring Segura as a hapless father, in “Father There Is Only One 5” he now confronts the opposite of an empty nest syndrome – a full nest of six children, his oldest daughter’s boyfriend, his father and wife’s mother and other in-laws. And nobody seems to be thinking about leaving.\n\nTiming is all, Gutiérrez explained in an on-stage conversation with Variety at this month’s Ventana Sur in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 2024, Sony asked Bowfinger to produce a Spanish version of “Death at a Funeral” to release Easter Week of 2025: a tight turnaround. Gutiérrez realized, however, that some of Spain’s top actors would be available in the summer, since on holiday. Released on time and co-produced with Atresmedia Cine, “Un funeral de locos” took €3.0 million ($3.5 million) at the Spanish box office, ranking No. 7 among 2025 local bows.\n\n“Torrente President”: Spain’s Biggest Box Office Bet\n\nAmong Atresmedia Cine’s next year Spanish premieres, bets are off as to which will make most money.\n\nEarly December, Segura confirmed a March 13 date for “Torrente Presidente,” the sixth part of a movie franchise which began in 1998 with “Torrente, the Dumb Arm of the Law,” hailed by Variety as “deliriously non p.c.” and “a tremendously enjoyable comedy-thriller” dominated by the kind of character – a perpetually inebriated, self-centered sexist, racist scumbag and blow-hard throw-back – which Spaniards had spent democracy disavowing as not representative of themselves nor modern Spain.\n\nDating “Torrente President’s” release, Segura said little about its plot-line. It will open, however, in the long run-up to general elections in Spain, which have to take place by August 2027, with one big question whether Spain’s far-right Vox will end up forming part of coalition governments at federal, regional or municipal levels.\n\nOne of “Torrente’s” most extraordinary achievements down he year’s has been to appeal across Spain’s bitter political divide. It remains to be seen if the saga’s sixth iteration’s satire still does so, or savages Vox. One scene leaked online shows Torrente addressing a crowd of followers from a balcony above a canvas banner for his party, Nox. “I have my bags ready to leave Spain on March 14,” Segura joked on Spanish comedy chat show “El Hormiguero.”\n\n‘La Bola Negra,’ Another 2026 Highlight\n\nIn all, Atresmedia Cine will see over 10 of its movies released in Spain next year. Its other most anticipated is “La Bola Negra,” written and directed by Javier Ambrossi and Javier Calvo, behind HBO Max U.S. pick-up “Veneno” and Arte France hit “La Mesías,” which burnished their credentials as one of the most exciting young film-TV creative duos in Europe.\n\nProduced by Movistar Plus+, Suma Content Films, France’s Le Pacte and Atresmedia Cine, distributed by Elástica Films in Spain and sold internationally by Goodfellas, “La Bola Negra” co-stars Penelope Cruz and Glenn Close in a large cast. It interweaves the interconnected lives of three men in three different eras, depicting lives intimately linked by sexuality and desire, pain and legacy. The film also incorporates and is partly inspired by Spanish poet and playwright Federico García Lorca’s unfinished novel of the same title, his first work with an explicitly gay protagonist. Set in 1932, during Spain’s Republic and in 1937, when gay men were imprisoned and executed by Francisco Franco’s forces, such as Lorca himself, and in 2017, “La Bola Negra” comes in at Spanish history from a little-explored angle of queer legacy. It also has a large Spanish choral cast of little known actors newcomers; which could be two reasons for the release date, Oct. 2, just after the San Sebastián Festival, a platform for both the film’s focus and cast.\n\nWhat Atresmedia Cine’s Slate of 2026 Releases Says About Current Spanish Cinema\n\n“Father There Is Only One” topped Spanish film box office charts for five of the last seven years. Not surprisingly, seven of the 12 titles confirmed by Atresmedia Cine to open in cinemas in 2026, or at least shoot next year, are comedies.\n\nThey’re carefully set apart, however. Two play off strong IP: “A Little Something Extra,” one 2026 shoot, adapts France’s 2024 No. 1 movie, beating out all Hollywood blockbusters, selling more than 10.8 million admissions – the equivalent of an around $80 million gross. Not for nothing, in 2023, one year when there was no “Father,” the highest-grossing Spanish film of the year was Javier Fesser’s “Championext,” another comedy starring non-professional actors with disabilities, which scored €11.9 million ($14.0 million).\n\nAnother Atresmedia Cine title set for 2026, “Beneton Family +2,” is a sequel to a 2024 original, which scored €4.1 million ($4.8 million) at the Spanish box office.\n\nBeneton Family+2 Credit: Marina Caputo\n\nTwo other Atresmedia Cine slate titles could be described as family comedies: “Abuela tremenda,” toplining Elena Irureta (“Patria”) as a battling grannie, targeting mature audiences, and “Tres de más,” a parenting farce with Kira Miró (“Alpha Males”), made for a younger crowd.\n\nSocial satire “Torrente Presidente” has the broadest of audiences. “La Roja,” another 2026 shoot and a title to follow, targets an adult audience in a movie about Spain’s cricket team, made up largely of players of foreign origin. A kind of “Full Monty” about integration, director Marcel Barrena has said, it promises the same mix of finally uplifting real-life social observance which he delivered so well in “The 47,” a film that shared a best picture Spanish Academy Goya this year, while hitting €4.0 million ($4.7 million) at Spanish theaters.\n\nBilled as black comedy, “Cada día nace un listo,” a painting heist caper, reps the latest from Arantxa Echevarría, whose ETA infiltration thriller “Undercover” shared this year’s best picture Goya and made a remarkable breakout €9.7 million ($11.4 million) in Spain off a 2024 bow.\n\nKarateca. Credit: Lander Larranaga\n\nElsewhere, given the uncertainties of Spain’s theatrical market, Atresmedia is hedging its bets, producing a real life sports bio, “Karateca,” a Spanish wingsuit BASE jumping adventure starring Carlos Cuevas (“Merlí”), Miguel Bernardeau (“Elite”) and Miguel Ángel Silvestre (“30 Coins”), teen musical “A Fuego” and “Viaje al país de los blancos,” a biopic of human rights activist Ousman Umar.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:40:41 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T13:49:23.606606"}

After traveling through a black hole, they arrive on a different floating rock, where they face harsh elements and unexpected predators in order to resettle. The catch is that these cosmonauts landing in an undiscovered world are dandelion seeds tethered to delicate, umbrella-like structures, or pappi, comprised of numerous, fuzzy bristles.\n\nTestament to the ingenious character design and astute writing behind the peculiar project (the screenplay is by Seto and Alain Layrac) is that the faceless heroes emote far more than one would ever expect from inanimate vegetation. Imbued with distinct physical attributes, the four seeds exhibit enough personality for audiences to understand their role in the group. One of them is heftier in size, while another appears almost frazzled, having lost most of its bristles. The other pair, including one with a bent stem or beak, resembles a romantic duo.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nEach time they survive a seemingly insurmountable ordeal, the four of them hug and giggle — yes, they make sounds. Despite there being no dialogue, in Seto’s universe, plants produce noises that communicate their emotional state. While the seed itself is presumably the most important part in their taxonomy, the way they move and interact with one another and their surroundings implies that their “faces” are in the middle of the bristles. Seto and the animation team have conceived endearing figures from their limited features.\n\nImpressive photorealistic details in certain textures, especially in the closeups of some of the creatures the roaming seeds encounter on this planet that closely resembles Earth and its flora and fauna. Early on, a frog defrosted from its sleep looks so lifelike that one might make the honest mistake of thinking it was a real animal filmed in the wild. Later, a pair of slugs that help the seed cross an arid landscape, like camels in the desert, glisten vividly.\n\nThat level of eye-deceiving detail falters in wide shots, however, some of which suffer from unflattering flat lighting that in certain instances recall computer screensavers of yore, given their colorful artificiality. Similarly, as the four seeds float across the land, the integration between them and the environment occasionally reads visually clunky in its execution, making the viewer aware of the compositing.\n\nIn watching “Dandelion’s Odyssey,” audiences might find easy comparisons to Gints Zilbalodis’ Oscar-winning “Flow,” not only because they are both entirely dialogue-free, but also because their narratives follow a similar arc. That said, Seto’s film aims for a more realistic aesthetic. “Dandelion’s Odyssey” also resembles 2016’s “Minuscule: Valley of the Lost Ants,” another French nature-based animated adventure, in which cartoonishly stylized bugs interact with natural environments.\n\nWhile Seto’s debut fits within this subset of wordless, observational exploits, the inventiveness and scientific research likely involved to envision obstacles and situations for the dandelion seeds to construct a high-stakes, compelling epic merits praise, even if the visuals can be uneven at times. Seto’s vision for the foreign planet, where the seeds search for a suitable locale for life to thrive, differs from Earth in notable ways. On this new home, life evolves at incredible speed (a frog’s eggs become tadpoles with the ability to float within seconds), and there are toxic liquids that threaten the seeds’ viability for fulfilling their biological purpose, as well as a sky with multiple moons and Saturn-like rings.\n\nAfter seeing the heroes fend for themselves, the resolution feels every bit as emotional as those in Don Bluth’s “The Land Before Time” or Disney’s “Dinosaur,” achieved with a fraction of the resources.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T13:49:23.908966"}

Some of us have been making this music for many decades, and that history still shapes us. We are not turning away from our audience, and do want to make sure that when we do return to the bandstand, the room is able to celebrate the full presence of the music and everyone in it.\n\n“Our hope is that this moment will leave space for reflection, not resentment.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nBilly Hart, the band’s drummer, told The New York Times that the name change “evidently” played a role in the decision to cancel.\n\nAnother group, Doug Varone and Dancers, said that it was cancelling April performances because of the name change.\n\nIn a statement on Instagram, the group wrote, “While we totally disagreed with the takeover by the Trump Administration at the Kennedy Center, we still believed it was important to honor our engagement out of respect for both Jane Raleigh and Alicia Adams, who curated a first-rate dance season, as well as for the dance audiences in DC.”\n\n“However, with the latest act of Donald J. Trump renaming the Center after himself, we can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution. The Kennedy Center was named in honor of our 35th President who fervently believed that the arts were the beating heart of our nation, as well as an integral part of international diplomacy. We hope in three-year’s time, that the Center and its reputation will return to that glory.”\n\nThe board of the Kennedy Center voted earlier this month to add Trump’s name to the center, even though it was designated as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by a 1964 act of Congress.\n\nLast week, musician Chuck Redd pulled out of a planned Christmas Eve concert, leading to the threat of a lawsuit from the Kennedy Center’s president, Richard Grenell. Another performer, Kristy Lee, canceled a planned performance on Jan. 14.\n\nAfter the latest cancellations, Grenell wrote on X, “The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership. Their actions prove that the previous team was more concerned about booking far left political activists rather than artists willing to perform for everyone regardless of their political beliefs. Boycotting the Arts to show you support the Arts is a form of derangement syndrome. The arts are for everyone and the left is mad about it.”\n\nThe board of the Kennedy Center was set to be split almost evenly between appointees of previous Democratic administrations and Trump in his first term. But weeks after taking office for a second term, Trump fired board members appointed by Joe Biden and Barack Obama. With his loyalists dominating the board, Trump was named chairman of the center.\n\nCongress also designates ex officio members of the board, who remain. One Democrat, Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio, filed suit earlier this month to remove Trump’s name from the center. Her lawsuit claimed that changing the name of the center can only be done by an act of Congress.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:43:59 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T13:49:24.228302"}

So f*** them. Until the next time. They haven’t gone away. They’re just licking their wounds. They’ll be back with something madder. But remember who it is next time? Right?\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“It’s always these sort of educated, middle-class, privileged, elitist, sort of people telling ordinary working-class people what they can and can’t do and say and laugh, not realizing how important comedy is to ordinary people.”\n\nGervais has been at the sharp end of controversies around comments in his previous stand-up specials. His 2022 show Supernature came under fire for trans jokes, which he later said didn’t target “trans folk, but trans activist ideology.” In 2023, a petition was started requesting that Netflix remove material about young cancer sufferers from Gervais’ Armageddon special.\n\nGervais said there had been numerous attempts to get him canceled over the past 15 years — including from fellow comedians who criticize him for “punching down.” “They’ve always failed,” he said. “I’m too old now not to say what I want. I want to say and do what I want all the time. I want to do my favorite thing all the time.”\n\nGervais turned to anthropology to offer an explanation for the rise of cancel culture. He said: “There’s still two ways you can raise your status in society. One, be competent at something, like, ‘Oh, he’s a good hunter, go with him, he’s good for the tribe.’ The other way you can raise your status is to have virtue like, ‘Oh, he’s not a great hunter, but he’s wise or kind or whatever.’\n\n“And then, with the advent of social media, people suddenly discovered they could just say they were virtuous. No evidence, no proof, just loads of flags in their bio. And they would raise their status by bringing other people down, catching other people out … And that’s where the term virtual signaling comes from, right?”\n\nHe continued: “The most annoying thing about virtue signalling is people being smug about having the morality of the age. You’re what you’re like because of where you are and when you are.”\n\nGervais said he considers himself to be anti-racist, but acknowledged that he could have been a slave owner in another century. He joked: “I’m willing to admit that if I’d have been born 300 years ago and I was white and wealthy, I’d have probably owned slaves. I’d be nice to them, so shut up, right? Yeah, I’d be the best slave owner.”\n\nGolden Globes Gag\n\nThe After Life creator also reflected on his time hosting the Golden Globes, praising the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for never censoring his jokes. He did reveal, however, that he stopped himself from making a gag about Jason Momoa in 2020.\n\nTodd Antony/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images\n\n“I thought the meta joke would be to show my hypocrisy and my cowardice, like, ‘I’m ok to slag off actors who’s scared of actors? But when it comes to a big dude, I’m not so brave.’ So I was gonna go, ‘I’ve got nothing bad to say about our next presenter, because he’s got a cock like a baby’s arm.’\n\n“I told my mate I was gonna do that, and my mate went, ‘Do you think people will think that’s racist?’ I went, ‘Why is it racist?’ ‘Well, because he’s a person of color.’ I went, ‘It’s nothing to do with that.

The characters devise a plan to enter the Abyss, rescue Vecna’s kidnapped children and destroy it with a bomb. In the final scene, Vecna— still disguised as the human Henry Creel—has his brainwashed victims join hands in a spellbinding séance as they are transported to the Abyss.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMatt and Ross Duffer created “Stranger Things” nearly a decade ago, and Netflix released the first season in July 2016.

But the military has always posed a threat, from Season 1 on. Even when Brenner is gone, he gets continually replaced by someone else. In this case, in Season 5, by Kay,” said Ross Duffer. “So we needed Kali to represent maybe a more pessimistic, but perhaps realistic, version, compared to Mike’s worldview of we’re gonna have butterflies and rainbows. And Kali’s going, ‘How is this going to work? And what is the solution here, that you can live a normal life?’ That’s really a huge part of Eleven’s journey this season.”\n\n“Stranger Things” is one of Netflix’s most popular shows of all time, and it recently surpassed 1.2 billion total views on the streamer.\n\nThe finale has a runtime of two hours and five minutes and will be the franchise’s first big-screen outing, playing in more than 500 theaters across the United States and Canada.

The week’s gross of $2,510,948 easily surpasses the show’s previous best-ever of $1,917,541 set just a week before. Granted, the more recent figure covers nine performances rather than the usual eight – holiday weeks often include extra performances – but Broadway’s Stranger Things mightn’t have needed the assist: The Broadway production has been thoroughly reinvigorated by the return last month of Netflix’s TV series.\n\nWith new Netflix episodes landing in November and December, fans are finding that the play – generally thought to be a standalone prequel – turns out to have some decided connections to the series’ latest developments. Just one example: In Stranger Things: The First Shadow, some rather cryptic (and unexplained) remarks are made about Henry Creel’s long-ago (and traumatic) visit to a cave near his home. The most recent batch of TV episodes shows just what Henry saw – and did – in that cave that left him forever changed.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nBroadway and West End box office figures for Shadow have seen the results: Box office for both stage productions have hit what appears to be sustained increases, with ticket sales at their highest levels since the initial launches of both productions.\n\nTo further the connections between the stage show and the TV show, producers of both gave some lucky Broadway attendees a real surprise at the end of the evening performance on December 19. In a sort of epilogue scene during the final moments of the play that depict Henry Creel taking a big step toward becoming the evil Vecna, the play’s usual Henry, the fantastic Louis McCartney, gave the stage over to Jamie Campbell Bower, TV’s Henry. The connection between the Stranger Things universes of stage and screen got a lot closer.\n\nAlso feeling the holiday bounty was Broadway’s Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, grossing a house record at the Lyric Theatre of $3,709,875 for the nine-performance week ending December 28. Cursed Child had set the the previous eight-performance house record of $3,152,533 for the week ending November 30, 2025, which happened to include the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nLike First Shadow, Cursed Child has gotten a recent boost from some stage-screen crossover: Tom Felton recently joined the Broadway cast as Draco Malfoy, the role he played in the Potter film franchise (in the stage sequel he plays the adult Draco, while in the films he was the child Draco). Felton’s arrival reinvigorated the Broadway box office of the nearly eight-year-old Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Felton continues in the role through May 10, 2026.\n\nAlso have a snazzy holiday week was Just In Time, the cool cat Bobby Darin bio-musical starring a knock-’em-dead Jonathan Groff, who’s in the role until March 29 (a replacement hasn’t been named). Although final figures for the week have not yet been released, sources say the holiday week saw Just In Time smashing Circle In The Square’s weekly gross record with the popular production’s highest grossing week to date. That means the Christmas Week figure must be steeper than Just In Time‘s previous record high of $1,470,023 reported for the week ending December 14.\n\nOne of the current fall season’s unqualified musical successes is Ragtime, and Christmas Week was no outlier. The non-profit Lincoln Center Theater’s glorious revival of the musical first staged on Broadway in 1998 has been selling out consistently since previewing in October. Starring Joshua Henry, Caissie Levy, Brandon Uranowitz, Colin Donnell, Ben Levi Ross and Shaina Taub, Ragtime, based on the E.L. Doctorow novel, broke the box office record at LCT’s Vivian Beaumont Theater with a Christmas Week gross of $1,588,107 (the venue’s previous record holder was My Fair Lady).\n\nThe full box office report for the week ending December 28 will be posted later this afternoon.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T15:29:37.826875"}

Murrow in “Good Night, and Good Luck,” he invited “60 Minutes” to sit in on rehearsals. As the cast gathered for their first read through, Clooney talked about the story’s prescience — though it’s set during McCarthyism in the 1950s, he saw parallels with the political pressure that news organizations face in the second Trump administration.\n\n“When the other three estates fail — when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us — the fourth estate has to succeed,” Clooney said. With that he pointed his finger directly at “60 Minutes'” cameras, which are owned by the same network that employed Murrow.\n\nBut Clooney feels that CBS has fallen short of its mission. In a new cover story with Variety tied to the release of his new movie, “Jay Kelly,” Clooney faults top law firms like Paul, Weiss, universities like Columbia, and news networks such as CBS and ABC for folding and settling when Trump and his lieutenants sued them.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go, fuck yourself, we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney says. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nIn the case of CBS, the suspicion was that Shari Redstone opted to make Trump’s lawsuit with “60 Minutes” go away so he would approve Paramount’s sale to Skydance. The deal went through and Paramount got a new owner in August. Clooney is horrified by how David Ellison, Skydance’s founder and Paramount’s chairman, has moved to reshape its coverage by installing conservative commentator Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\n“Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,” Clooney says. “Am I worried about film studios? Sure. It’s my business, but my primary loyalty is to my country. I’m much more worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press.”\n\nWith Trump back in office, Clooney has continued to sound off on the threats that he poses to civil liberties and to America’s standing in the world.\n\n“It’s a very trying time,” Clooney says. “It can depress you or make you very angry. But you have to find the most positive way through it. You have to put your head down and keep moving forward because quitting isn’t an option.”\n\nAt one point, before Trump descended that golden escalator and set the country on a MAGA course, Clooney and the reality TV star were friends.\n\n“I knew him very well,” Clooney says. “He used to call me a lot, and he tried to help me get into a hospital once to see a back surgeon. I’d see him out at clubs and see him out at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\nClooney thinks the Democrats will re-take the House in 2026 and he’s optimistic that the pendulum will swing back in the direction of liberalism after America has its full of Trump.\n\n“Just straight up, it’s the economy stupid,” Clooney says. “It’s more expensive now than it was when Joe Biden left office. And powerful people tend to overplay their hands. I think that cruelty, like separating children from their parents, although popular with small groups of people, doesn’t play well with most Americans.”\n\nHe doesn’t share the anxiety of many Democrats that Trump will refuse to give up his White House perch and run for a third term.\n\n“His popularity is very low and it’s not going to be shooting back up,” Clooney says. “We do have a constitution that we do abide by, and although I’ve been disappointed by many of the Supreme Court’s decisions, they are strict constitutionalists.”\n\nNot only is Clooney worried about the direction of the country, he’s also concerned about the changes roiling the movie business. He doesn’t fear streaming services. He’s worked for them before and though “Jay Kelly” is a celebration of cinema, it’s being bankrolled by Netflix, a sign of how endangered movies for grownups have become as theatrical propositions. When we sat down in November, Netflix had yet to secure a deal to buy Warner Bros., but Clooney was already concerned about what the sale of the studio where he made many of his greatest movies would signal about the health of the industry.\n\n“I liked having separate studios, and I liked them for what they were each good at, and that kind of specialization has gone away,” he laments. “I worry about things all getting rolled up into one giant company. That would be a very sad moment. Sometimes a big company buys all these little players, and they all lose their identity.”\n\nBut Clooney believes that the future of movies is less important than the direction of America and its leading news organizations.\n\n“If you’re asking if I’m worried about the film studios, sure,” he says. “That’s my business. But my loyalty is to my country, and I’m much more worried about how we inform ourselves.”\n\nClooney is particularly concerned with the development of AI. He’s seen how much easier it has become to create fake videos that can distort and deceive.\n\n“Now you can wash the watermark off of TikTok, and the only way you’re able to discern whether it’s AI generated or not is by the aspect ratio,” he says. “What’s going to happen when we get an AI generated video of Putin saying he’s launched the first strike? And do we have responsible enough people with their fingers on all the triggers to look at this and separate what’s real from what’s fake? We used to say, don’t believe everything you read, but we always believed what we saw. Now you can’t do that.”\n\nAI is changing the movie business, as well. Shortly before Clooney sat down with Variety, news broke that Tilly Norwood, an AI-generated actress, had drawn interest from agencies hoping to represent her. Clooney doesn’t think he or his fellow A-listers will lose work to Tilly.\n\n“As a day player, sure she might be successful, but are you going to build a whole narrative around her?” he says. “You can create an AI character, but is it gonna actually break you like Emma Stone? AI can combine all the characters that Emma Stone has played, but it can’t capture her magic. It’s like that Supreme Court Justice who said, ‘I can’t describe porn, but I know when I see it.’ It’s the same thing with movie stars. I can’t tell you why someone is one, but I can’t take my eye off of them when they’re on screen. It’s very rare when that exists.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:20:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T16:35:13.931821"}

His hair is mostly gray, his face slightly lined, but at 64, he’s still incandescently handsome in that effortless, Cary Grant-like way.\n\n“My kids get sick with something; they’re fine in three days.” Clooney finds the water, pops it open and takes a swig. “I’m an old shit — it takes me forever!” He chuckles with that wry laugh we’ve heard for four decades. “I’d been traveling for work, and I got home and my son, Alexander” — who is 8 — “came running up to me saying, ‘Papa, Papa, I don’t feel well,’ and he sneezed in my mouth. I’ve been sick as a dog.”\n\nDoes that sound like a movie star to you? Clooney has been deeply enmeshed in the public consciousness for so long — since he became a phenom with “ER” in the ’90s — that he’s shaped our idea of celebrity as something not only glamorous, but good. He’s used his fame to draw attention to causes from Darfur to gun control while defending the role of a free press (he grew up the son of broadcast journalist Nick Clooney in Kentucky). At the same time, he’s become Hollywood’s eternal prankster, pulling one over on Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and his other big-name buddies with elaborate gags that make him more relatable.\n\nHe was also committed to bachelorhood — that is, until he married human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin in 2014. Now a family man with two children, he’s ready for his next era, showing an industry obsessed with youth how to age gracefully on-screen. “If you’re trying to hold on to being a romantic leading man at my age, it gets sad,” Clooney says. “I don’t want to be pathetic.”\n\nUnlike his other big-screen contemporaries, you won’t find him clinging to the side of a plane or romancing starlets long after he’s qualified for AARP membership. Instead, he’s stretching himself artistically. Clooney made his Broadway debut this year in a stage version of “Good Night, and Good Luck,” the 2005 film about journalist Edward R. Murrow he co-wrote, directed and appeared in. He followed that up by playing a movie star past his matinee idol prime in “Jay Kelly.” The complex character study pushed him in new directions as a performer, reigniting his creative spark and allowing him to dig deeper.\n\n“I got my groove back as an actor,” Clooney says. “I rediscovered why I love this profession. It’s not that I wasn’t challenging myself on my last few films, but I knew how to play those parts.” He’s referring to “Ticket to Paradise,” which saw him in rom-com mode opposite Julia Roberts, and “Wolfs,” an action comedy about roguish fixers that reteamed him with Pitt. “With this one, I felt like I did when I started acting and was trying to figure it out,” Clooney says. “You’re thinking, ‘Am I a fraud? Am I going to be found out?’ It’s a really good place to be, to feel off your game.”\n\nClooney needn’t have worried. Not only did he score his best reviews in years, but he also earned a Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a musical or comedy and is in the thick of the Oscar race.\n\n“Jay Kelly” is kicking off Clooney’s career pivot — even though, on paper, playing a movie star doesn’t sound like much of a stretch. But the A-lister he embodies in “Jay Kelly” is a self-absorbed, career-obsessed performer. He may be beloved by fans around the world, but he’s estranged from his family and doesn’t have any friends. When Jay accepts a lifetime achievement award in Tuscany, the only person who shows up is his long-suffering manager (Adam Sandler). Everyone else has other plans.\n\n“When I watched it, I kept thinking, ‘Thank God George’s life is the complete opposite of this,” says Roberts, a friend and frequent co-star. “You’d be sending people away if there was a George Clooney tribute. The event would be standing room only.”\n\n“Jay Kelly” follows its title character as he treks across Italy, flanked by publicists and stylists, trying to meet up with his daughter, who is backpacking through Europe. She resents him, as does the army of handlers he pays to airbrush his image. Clooney initially worried that Noah Baumbach, who co-wrote and directed the film, had the wrong idea about him.\n\nRichard Phibbs for Variety\n\n“I read the script, and there was a part of me that went, ‘Does he think this is who I am?’” Clooney says. “Because I knew Noah a little bit, and this character’s deeply unhappy and kind of a jerk. But then I thought it might be fun to play someone who thinks he’s a good guy, but everything he touches, he destroys.”\n\nAs they worked on the film, Baumbach sprinkled more details from Clooney’s life into the script, enjoying the meta-ness of the story. Like Clooney, Jay is from Kentucky, and the film includes a moment where one of the actor’s fans urges him to run for president, pressure Clooney often receives from disaffected liberals.\n\n“The illusion, of course, is that George is somehow playing his alter ego,” says Baumbach. “If George was playing a dentist, nobody would be asking about similarities. But because movie stars are reflections back at us, and we all have these histories with them, it feels more intense. They are kind of avatars for our hopes and dreams.”\n\nClooney, unlike his character, doesn’t stay cloistered in a celebrity bubble, untouchable and inaccessible. He acts like the mayor of any movie set, getting to know everyone by name and refusing to retreat to his trailer between scenes. “Jay Kelly” was no exception. Clooney and Sandler spent their downtime playing basketball, inviting everyone to shoot hoops with them.\n\n“Anybody could walk up, and he’d throw them a ball,” Sandler says. “Because it’s Europe, where it’s more about football than basketball, George would show them the proper form and how to shoot. He turned about 20 Italian crew members into real hoops players.”\n\nClooney fosters an easygoing work environment, partly so he can be loose when the cameras are ready to roll. “I grew up in the Spencer Tracy school,” he says, “which is, you know, come in, be prepared, know what your character wants in the scene. Then, when they say, ‘Cut and print,’ you get on with your life.”\n\nPulling pranks is all part of the Clooney package; it helps keep things light and shows he doesn’t take celebrity too seriously. Friends say he spends years finding ways to catch them by surprise.\n\n“He’s very patient, which makes him lethal when it comes to pranks,” Steven Soderbergh says. “He had one teed up for [producer] Jerry Weintraub that was jaw-dropping that he never even used. He’d somehow gotten ahold of Jerry’s golf clubs, and [when Jerry was napping] he took some very compromising photographs of them arranged in a way that clubs should not be arranged. It would have been seismic.”\n\nWhile making 2014’s “The Monuments Men,” Clooney had the wardrobe department take in the waist of Damon’s costumes by an eighth of an inch every day.\n\n“I was in my early 40s at the time, and worried about going to seed,” Damon says. “He just delighted in messing with me. Long after that happened, I came home from making another movie and put on a suit that was too tight. My first thought was that George had gotten into my closet.”\n\nIn 1998, Clooney was shooting his final season of “ER” on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank when he heard that Paul Newman was a few soundstages away working on “Message in a Bottle.” He grabbed a golf cart and set out to meet one of his idols. He found Newman sitting outside, drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. At this point, “ER” was one of the most popular shows on TV, commanding roughly 30 million viewers an episode.\n\n“I pulled up and I go, ‘Hey, Mr. Newman,’” Clooney recalls. “And he clearly had no clue who I was. But he was friendly and we started talking. People would drive by going, ‘George!’ ‘Hey, George!’ ‘Hey, man!’ Bit by bit, he figured out that I was well known in some way. And as I started to leave, he goes, ‘Don’t let them keep you inside.’”\n\nIt took Clooney a while to appreciate what Newman meant, but gradually his warning became clear. “What he was talking about was fame, and the tendency to surround yourself with managers and PR people who build these walls of security so that you don’t get caught doing something stupid,” Clooney says. “But what happens is you can divorce yourself from what’s really going on out there. You need people in your life that tell you the truth.”\n\nRichard Phibbs for Variety\n\nHe thinks the character Jay liked staying in a self-congratulatory cocoon, a predilection that was exacerbated by his early superstardom. “I feel like Jay Kelly got famous young, and I don’t know how young people handle fame,” Clooney says. “There’s too much attention on you. You believe too much about how great you are. Some actors can deal with it when they’re young — Timothée Chalamet seems to — but I don’t think I would have been one of those people.”\n\nIn contrast, Clooney spent years as a journeyman actor, shuffling through bit parts on “Roseanne” and “The Facts of Life.” (“I have probably the best mullet of all time” is Clooney’s assessment of his sitcom work.) It was his performance as a womanizing pediatrician on “ER” that made him a household name when the show premiered in 1994. By that point, Clooney was 33. “I’d failed a lot,” he says. “I’d been rejected a lot. And so I was better prepared for success.”\n\nIt helped that he knew how fleeting fame can be, having watched his aunt Rosemary Clooney go from chart-topping singer and actress to cautionary tale as she struggled with drugs and lost opportunities. “She did everything wrong — there was booze and pills. You name it,” he says. “I was a kid in Kentucky, but when I did get to know her, the career was long gone. She wasn’t the beautiful blond from ‘White Christmas’ — she was trying to sing in clubs and having a real bad time.”\n\nClooney has been called “the last movie star,” and it is true that he has a kind of elegance and charm that seems increasingly rare. But he doesn’t totally buy it. He thinks there’s a rising crop of actors who are ready to take up the mantle, rattling off the names of Chalamet and Glen Powell as younger performers who impress him. He also praises Zendaya, calling her “an exceptional talent.” But he does acknowledge that they’re inheriting a fractured entertainment landscape. He came of age in the monoculture — when hit shows like “ER” or movies like “Ocean’s Eleven” commanded the entire public’s attention. That all changed as TikTok and YouTube made it easier than ever for anyone to achieve their 15 minutes of fame.\n\n“The thing where you put someone’s name above the title and you go see a movie because they’re in it has ended,” Clooney says. “And I’m part of the last generation of stars who were a beneficiary of a studio really investing in them. When I was on ‘ER,’ Bob Daly and Terry Semel, who were running Warner Bros. at the time, brought me in and gave me a five-picture deal. Because their company had produced my show, they wanted to be in business with me for the long haul.”\n\nThey also were patient with their investment. When Val Kilmer dropped out as Batman, Clooney was hired to wear the cape and cowl. He assumed the superhero movie would prove his bankability. Instead, when “Batman & Robin” came out in 1997, it was a campy disaster that nearly killed the franchise and Clooney’s movie career.\n\n“It was a very painful suit, and you couldn’t move,” Clooney remembers. “I would be laying on a board, and Joel Schumacher would direct you with a giant speaker, and he would go, ‘OK, George, and here we go. And ready? Your parents are dead. You have nothing to live for. And — action!’ And then they’d just prop me up and I go, ‘I’m Batman,’ and they go, ‘And cut.’ And they drop me back down, and then they carry me out on the board.”\n\nClooney regained his stride with 1998’s “Out of Sight,” a romantic thriller in which he smoldered alongside Jennifer Lopez in a sexually charged game of cops and robbers. It also kicked off his long association with Soderbergh. Critics embraced the film, and the response taught Clooney something valuable about believing your own hype.\n\n“I got destroyed for ‘Batman & Robin,’ and fair enough — I’m terrible and it’s a bad film,” he says. “The next film I do is ‘Out of Sight.’ It’s one of the best films I’ve ever been in. I’m good in it because it’s well written and has a great director and cast. I didn’t learn how to act any better in those six months between projects. I was protected by the talent around me.”\n\nGoing forward, Clooney made a point of surrounding himself with visionary filmmakers like Soderbergh, Alexander Payne (“The Descendants”) and the Coen brothers (“O Brother, Where Art Thou?”), who made challenging stories mostly aimed at adults. And he largely steered clear of franchises that offered mega-paydays but would have locked him to a certain genre or a signature part.\n\n“Most of my successes were middle-of-the-road hits,” Clooney says. “And that’s lucky, because I was never typecast. I could do all kinds of things. I could do movies that were very serious, like ‘Michael Clayton,’ and then do something wild like ‘Burn After Reading.’ It meant that once I couldn’t kiss the girl anymore, I could still have a career.”\n\nLong before he was famous, Clooney learned about morality from his father, with whom he remains close. Clooney’s dad’s career in journalism inspired him to be an engaged citizen and led to his interest in the story of “Good Night, and Good Luck,” a drama about how CBS News stood up to Joseph McCarthy. When the film was released, Clooney intended to draw parallels between Murrow and how the media was covering the lead-up to the Iraq War. Two decades later, with Donald Trump in office, it hits differently. When Clooney played Murrow last spring, CBS News was settling a frivolous lawsuit with Trump so that he’d approve the sale of its parent company, Paramount, to Skydance. That enraged Clooney, as did ABC News’ similar settlement with the president over a defamation claim.\n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go fuck yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney says. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nHe’s only grown more alarmed as David Ellison, Paramount’s new owner, has reshaped CBS News’ coverage in a more MAGA-friendly way by installing conservative commentator Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief. “Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,” Clooney says. “I’m worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press.”\n\nClooney, who always seems to run cool, grows animated discussing how certain members of that profession have abandoned journalism’s mission to hold the powerful to account. It makes him think about something Murrow says in both the film and the play. “‘Let’s not confuse dissent with disloyalty,’” Clooney says. “I mean, what a beautiful, important statement about who we are at our best. But all too often we fall short.”\n\nOn the set of “Jay Kelly” in Italy Peter Mountain/Netflix\n\nClooney has long been one of the entertainment industry’s most outspoken liberals, so it’s no surprise to hear that he believes President Trump’s behavior flies in the face of Murrow’s ideals. “It’s a very trying time,” Clooney says. “It can depress you or make you very angry. But you have to find the most positive way through it. You have to put your head down and keep moving forward because quitting isn’t an option.”\n\nWhat is surprising, though, is that before Trump set the country on a MAGA course, Clooney and the reality-TV star were friendly. “I knew him very well,” Clooney says. “He used to call me a lot, and he tried to help me get into a hospital once to see a back surgeon. I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\nIn 2024, Clooney made a big political stir, not by criticizing Trump, but for a New York Times op-ed he wrote urging Joe Biden to drop out of the race following his debate meltdown. Many Democrats were relieved that someone was taking a stand that might save the country from Trump, but the Biden family has continued to criticize Clooney for being disloyal.\n\nSoderbergh says, “I thought, ‘Holy shit.’ It’s classic George. He knows there are going to be so many people pissed at him, but if something is wrong, he’s going to speak out. Somebody had to say it.”\n\nClooney wants to model his next phase as an actor on Newman, who he considers the gold standard in how to transition to elder statesman status. Instead of clinging to his heartthrob past, Newman focused on enriching the parts he played as he got older.\n\n“He went from performing love scenes in ‘Absence of Malice’ to doing shattering work — and looking his age — in ‘The Verdict,’” Clooney says. “And it was seamless.”\n\nNext up for Clooney is “In Love,” a low-budget drama in which he will appear opposite Annette Bening as a man with Alzheimer’s. It’s indicative of the more personal projects he hopes to make.\n\n“I’m not going to be doing a whole lot of major studio kinds of films,” Clooney says. “The films that I’m going to be working on for the most part are going to be smaller. If I’m going to go off and do something and be away from my kids, there has to be a real creative reason for it. Money isn’t an issue for me anymore.”\n\nBut there’s one franchise Clooney plans to revive — “Ocean’s Eleven.” Although instead of a nostalgia play, he wants to explore what it’s like to pull off a heist when you’re no longer young and spry. He was inspired by the movie “Going in Style,” a ’70s comedy about a group of aging criminals, and he’s enlisted Roberts, Damon, Pitt and Don Cheadle to return as an older, but wiser gang. They are scouting locations and hope to start shooting next October.\n\n“There was something about the idea that we’re too old to do what we used to do, but we’re still smart enough to know how to get away with something, that just appeals to me,” Clooney says. “They’ve lost a step, and they need to find a way to work around their limitations.”\n\nPersonally, Clooney says he’s happier than ever. He has a large network of friends, and makes a point of planning boys’ trips and keeping in touch with people through chat groups. He and Damon are part of a Wordle network that Clooney has dubbed “Nerdle” because of its intricacy — they do three puzzles every day, add up the scores and the winner gets to choose the word they start with the next morning. “George is frustratingly good at it,” Damon says.\n\nHe also has loved having a family, brightening when he talks about becoming a dad to twins in his 50s.\n\n“This chapter of George’s life fills me with so much joy,” Roberts says. “Amal is an absolute rock star. I could never conjure up a dream girl like this for George, and to watch him with his kids is so special.”\n\n“Jay Kelly,” with its portrait of a stultifying form of celebrity, may be very different from the way that Clooney operates on and off screen. However, Clooney’s art and life do converge at the end of the film as Jay sits in a theater watching clips of his performances. The scenes Baumbach splices together are all drawn from Clooney’s films — there he is, saving the world in “The Peacemaker,” working all the angles as an operator in “Michael Clayton” and sipping a scotch while playing a smooth criminal in “Out of Sight.”\n\nIt’s impossible not to be moved by the sheer weight of the filmography, as well as to feel that the period of cinema he represents, one in which star power was the biggest special effect of all, is slipping away. “When we shot it, all I had told him was that I wanted to show him something,” Baumbach says. “He didn’t question it. He just remained open to what I was going to do.”\n\nThe take Baumbach ended up using, one in which Clooney’s eyes begin to well with emotion, was the first one he shot.\n\n“When you’re young you’re desperately figuring out a way to cry,” Clooney says. “You’re pulling out nose hairs and pinching yourself. But the older you get, the faster the emotions bubble up. I have no trouble tearing up now.”\n\nSome things do improve with age.\n\nLocation: Ludlow House", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T16:35:14.157269"}

The first two epsiiodes will drop on Jan. 13, followed by weekly episodes; the finale will drop Feb. 24.\n\nWatch the trailer for the podcast below:", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T17:00:53.660872"}

The NCAA Men’s Basketball Championship made it back on the top 100 telecasts lists, having been replaced last year by the NCAA Women’s Basketball Championship.\n\nWith no Olympics taking up space in 2025, there was a little more room for entertainment: And live awards shows continue to rule the roost, starting with the 97th Oscars — the only non-sports telecast to clock the top 20. Back on March 2, 20.3 million people saw “Anora” take the best picture prize — up slightly from 20.2 in 2024 and 19.4 million in 2023. CBS’ Grammys kudocast dipped to 16.2 million viewers in 2025, down from 18.1 million last year, but still good enough for No. 33. And making its way back on the chart this year (for the first time since 2020) was CBS’ 82nd Golden Globes, at a strong 9.9 million viewers.\n\nThose weren’t the only special events to make the list. NBC’s “Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special” was a smash, beating any regular primetime series performance with a whopping 16.5 million viewers.\n\nBut the real hero for a second year in a row is CBS’s breakout hit “Tracker,” which scored a remarkable 19 episodes on the year’s top 100 primetime telecasts ranker — more than anything except the NFL, and up from last year’s 15 slots. Also notable, particularly given the cloud now surrounding what has happened to “60 Minutes” under new CBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, the stalwart newsmagazine last seven slots in the top 100 this year (up from four last year).\n\nOther entertainment entries included the Season 34 finale of ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars,” which scored its best season ender in nearly a decade. Also: the post-Super Bowl episode of Fox’s gamer “The Floor” enjoyed tremendous sampling behind the Big Game, and the series premiere of CBS’ procedural drama “Watson,” which aired behind the AFC championship in January.\n\nAmong all outlets, CBS led with the most slots with 35 (up from 25 last year), thanks to all those “Tracker” and “60 Minutes” episodes. Next was NBC with 20, then ABC (15), Fox (14), Prime Video (12) and ESPN (4).\n\nBelow, our ratings roundup of the year’s most-watched primetime telecasts (in Live+7 ratings), according to broadcast and cable measurements, in both total viewers and adults 18-49.\n\n\n\n[For historical record, here are previous year-end telecast rankers: 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015.]\n\nMOST-WATCHED PRIMETIME TELECASTS OF 2025 (TOTAL VIEWERS)\n\nRank PROGRAM (NETWORK) VIEWERS DATE AIRED 1.

He was 77.\n\nA rep for Smallwood confirmed to Variety that he died of complications from kidney failure on Tuesday at the Brooke Grove Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Maryland.\n\nThroughout his career, Smallwood established himself as a powerful vocalist, pianist and songwriter in the gospel space, earning eight Grammy nominations and winning several Dove and Stellar Awards. As leader for the Richard Smallwood Singers and later Vision, Smallwood scored several hits including “Total Praise,” “Trust Me” and “I’ll Trust You.” Over the years, his songs were covered by artists including Houston, who remade “I Love the Lord” for “The Preacher’s Wife,” as well as Destiny’s Child, who covered “Total Praise” as part of a 2007 acapella track “Gospel Medley.”\n\nSmallwood was born in November 1948 in Atlanta, GA, and was raised in Washington, D.C. by his mother and stepfather. He began playing piano at the age of five and formed his own gospel group by 11. He attended Howard University, where he earned a degree in music, and was a member of the university’s first gospel group, the Celestials.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn 1977, he founded the Richard Smallwood Singers and signed to Onyx Records in 1982 to release their debut album “The Richard Smallwood Singers,” which spent 87 weeks on the Billboard Spiritual Album Sales chart. They received their first Grammy nomination for their 1984 album “Psalms,” and continued to release five more records.\n\nSmallwood disbanded the Smallwood Singers in the early 1990s and formed the backing choir Vision, which accompanied him on numerous albums through 2015. Their song “Trust Me,” which hit No. 9 on the Hot Gospel Songs chart, scored his final Grammy nomination in 2012 in the best gospel song category. In 2019, he published the book “Total Praise: The Autobiography,” detailing his family’s personal history. In the last few years of his life, Smallwood battled mild dementia and other health issues that prevented him from recording new music.\n\nSmallwood is survived by his brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and godchildren.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:40:48 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T17:54:19.368951"}

[&#8230;]", "content": "Canadian romance novelist Rachel Reid first saw Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams in person on the set of “Heated Rivalry,” Jacob Tierney’s television adaptation of her queer hockey book series “Game Changers.”\n\n“They were filming the very first sex scene, their first hookup and it’s the longest sex scene on the show,” Reid tells me. “It was a closed set, so I was just sitting on a couch for four hours while they did that. I had headphones, so I could hear it and I had read the script, but I couldn’t see it. I was just listening. I was listening to them pretend to have sex for four hours, and I didn’t really know them, so that was weird.\n\n“I do remember Hudson saying, ‘Should I keep my socks on?’” she continues. “I was nodding, but nobody could see me. I’m glad he did.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Heated Rivalry” stars Storrie as Russian hockey star Ilya Rozanov and Williams as his archrival Shane Hollander. The six-episode series follows the two men as they carry on a secret years-long affair before eventually falling in love.\n\nThe show became a runaway hit as soon as HBO Max, which acquired the series for U.S. distribution from Canadian streamer Crave, dropped the first two episodes over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nOn set, Storrie tapped Reid on the shoulder to introduce himself. “He looked so much like Ilya and he speaks with a Russian accent all day while on set,” Reid recalls. “He was asking all these thoughtful questions about the character. I couldn’t even talk to him because it’s like I’m explaining Ilya to Ilya. It was very weird, but I could tell right away he was really smart and funny and charming. He’s so talented and fearless. I mean, introducing yourself to the author for the first time while doing a Russian accent is, I think, a fearless choice.”\n\nShe watched Williams film the moments before Shane and Ilya have their initial tryst in a hotel room. “He was turning the lamp on and off waiting for Ilya to come for the first hookup,” Reid says. “He had no lines, but I was like, ‘Oh, that’s Shane.’”\n\nIn just over a month, Storrie and Williams have become household names, the series has been greenlit for a second season and several of Reid’s novels have become New York Times bestsellers.\n\n“I’ve been asked to speak at the University of Cambridge,” Reid says. “I write hockey smut. I’m not Kurt Vonnegut. They were like, ‘We’ve had Robert De Niro and the Dalai Lama.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, and me — I fit right in there.’”\n\nI caught up with Reid over Zoom from her home in Nova Scotia. “I’ll warn you, I think I’m still in shock,” she says. “I don’t know if I could speak coherently about any of this, but I’ll try.”\n\nWhen you initially talked to Jacob, was there any discussion of you having any sort of creative control or a say in what he does?\n\nThe first conversation I had with him, I could tell he understood the characters so well and the story so well. He laid out his whole vision for the show, and that really is exactly what everybody just watched. That’s how he described it to me. He wanted that Scott and Kip episode. We talked about what we were going to have to do to make sure we got everything right, how the sex was going to have to be an important part of the show and it was going to have to be explicit. He wouldn’t do it if he couldn’t do that. As soon as we had that first conversation, I was like, “You know what? He knows exactly what he’s doing. I’m not even worried about it.” I wasn’t really pushy at all. He just wanted me to read the scripts and I was really excited to do that. Obviously, he was very capable of doing this without my help, but he still included me. They [Tierney, Williams and Storrie] continued throughout all of the media and everything mentioning me and the books. I really appreciate that because I don’t think a lot of authors get that.\n\nWhich casting did you know about first?\n\nConnor was first. I didn’t even hear about another possibility for Ilya. If there was one, I didn’t know about it. I know that Jacob was very excited about Connor. But it was a thing where we said that he pretty much has to be actually Russian because if he’s not, it’s going to be so distracting. People will be able to tell. The whole thing falls apart if he’s not believably Russian. So when he told me, “Well, he’s American and does not have Russian heritage, but he’s really good,” I was like, “Well, OK, if you say so.” I think it took a little longer to find Hudson, but as soon as they did their chemistry read, Jacob was very excited about it. I can’t even imagine what other actors would’ve been like.\n\nWhen you saw Connor and Hudson, did they look like what you were imagining when you were writing Ilya and Shane?\n\nAt first, not quite, because I was just looking at still images of them [on Instagram]. Hudson had a lot of pictures where he looked like a badass and he was smoking or showing off all of his tattoos. I was like, “I’m not seeing it.” But then as soon as I met them on set, I was like, “Yep, they’re actually perfect.”\n\nWriting is such a solitary profession. What is it like going from being by yourself writing to now having all these eyes and attention on you?\n\nIt’s overwhelming. Authors don’t want to be looked at. It’s not a natural thing. I used to be in a rock band, and that’s an art that you make where you get your audience feedback right away live and you can feed off of it. But writing, even if it’s big and popular and you know a lot of people are reading it, you don’t know about it. You don’t get that feedback really until something like this happens. And then suddenly it’s like, “Oh, I can actually get mobbed sometimes.” People are just very excited to meet me in a way that kind of confuses me, but I’m trying to get used to it.\n\nHave you spoken to Jacob about what you’d like to see in Season 2?\n\nI think we’re on the same page about it. Obviously, the focus has to stay on Ilya and Shane. We’re not going to do Season 2 and it’s a totally different couple. It wouldn’t be very popular. Not that we weren’t expecting it, but I think we’re all surprised at how popular Scott and Kip were. So now it’s, “OK, how do you get more Scott and Kip?” I think it’s going to be mostly “The Long Game.” Jacob’s already said that in interviews, but there’s another book “Role Model” that kind of overlaps it. So I’m hoping that we’ll get both stories told at the same time. I don’t think there’s another way you could do it. I’m hoping we get more episodes.\n\nHow many episodes do you want?\n\nI’d go as high as 12, but maybe if it was just eight or 10, that would be nice.\n\nBrendan Brady, Jacob Tierney, Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova, Dylan Walsh, Hudson Williams, Connor Storrie, Christina Chang and Rachel Reid attend the premiere of “Heated Rivalry” at TIFF Lightbox on November 24, 2025 in Toronto, Ontario. Getty Images\n\nDo you have a group of gay friends who you have ask you to read your writing, specifically the sex scenes, to make sure they’re realistic?\n\nI don’t send them writing. Actually, I realized when the show came out that a lot of my gay male friends have never read my books because they’re all obsessed with the show and they were all on their edge of their seats. They couldn’t believe things that were happening. I was like, “So you’ve not read the books?” I have discussions with them. I don’t like showing anybody my writing until it’s done. My husband is somebody that I can send them to because he is bisexual and does know what it’s like to have sex with men. So that’s somebody I can bounce things off of. But mostly I just talk to people and get information that way.\n\nWill there ever be a “Heated Rivalry” Broadway musical?\n\nI hope so, because I still hold the stage rights to that. It was the thing that when I signed the contract, I was like, “Yeah, that’ll never happen.” But now I’m like, “Maybe.” We’re talking about all sorts of things right now. I was saying to Hudson a couple weeks ago that it feels like we could do literally anything. It just seems like we have too much power and we also have the power to destroy ourselves very easily. We could take it all down with one bad post, one bad tweet. We could destroy the whole show and everybody’s lives. I was just like, “This is too much power.”\n\nYou have talked about being diagnosed with Parkinson’s at the same time Jacob approached you about the television adaptation. How is your health today?\n\nIt’s making it hard to write because I can barely control a mouse. I can’t type for very long. It’s hard for me to sit in a chair for very long. I need to figure out new ways to write. I don’t know if that will be voice to text. I don’t know if I can write that way. It doesn’t feel natural, but I need to figure out something because it is taking me a very long time to write now. But an amazing thing that’s come out of this though is Jacob was on CNN a few weeks ago. For whatever reason, the interviewer asked him about my Parkinson’s diagnosis. I thought it was kind of odd, but then the next day, one of the top Parkinson’s experts in the world reached out to me and asked if he could help me. I’ve never gotten to talk to a Parkinson’s expert. I’ve been on a five-year waiting list here because I live in a very small place. Now he’s found me a Parkinson’s expert, a neurologist, and I have an appointment in a couple weeks. That could change things for me because I’m not really getting the treatment that I should be getting. He also told me how to change my medication so I can sleep because I never slept. That change made me sleep through the night, which really helps with writing.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:49:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T19:00:30.493959"}

No cause of death was immediately given.\n\nIn later years Lippman was best known for serving as a manager to Michael, first at the peak of his fame during the “Faith” era in the late 1980s, and then again, after a 17-year gap, beginning in the mid-2000s.\n\nBut his first major notoriety came in his stint as attorney and, briefly, manager for Bowie from 1971 through 1975, with the rock star even living at Lippman’s home during the “Station to Station” period before an abrupt split.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAfter his experience with Bowie, Lippman switched gears and took a label role as VP of west coast operations for Arista Records for three years into the late ’70s, after having become friendly with the imprint’s founder while making a deal for Patti Smith to join the label. “Clive Davis was the boss and I always thought my job was to take people to lunch and dinner for a living, and I did it very well,” he quipped. More seriously, perhaps, Lippman said Davis “really made an impact on me. I never saw a man work that hard and that long every day. He’d be in the office until nine or 10 o’clock and then would have ­dinner. He inspired me to put in the time.”\n\nAt Arista, Lippman worked closely with artists like Melissa Manchester. He took credit for forcing the Oscars to allow Manchester to sing two best-song-nominated numbers on the Academy Awards telecast in 1980, a first (the songs being “Through the Eyes of Love” from “Ice Castles” and “I’ll Never Say Goodbye” from “The Promise,” both of which she had sung on the original soundtracks).\n\nLippman was an innovator in seeing a need for producers and songwriters to have managers just as recording artists did.\n\n“What I saw was that record producers and songwriters were really treated like low men on the totem pole and represented by a lawyer but never a manager,” he recalled in a 2010 interview. “I realized they’re artists in their own right and need to make sure their deals are done properly and their records they make are worked. That’s what I did and started a company representing producers and songwriters.”\n\nIn 1980, he began managing producer Ron Nevison, and soon took on Elton John’s writing collaborator, Bernie Taupin, in a professional partnership that lasted for 37 years.\n\nLippman saw the advent of so-called 360 deals as a natural extension of the cross-platform interest he had always taken in developing artists as a manager.\n\n“That’s what I’ve always done, taking are of all aspects of my artists’ career from touring to merchandising to selling records to making videos,” he said. “I’m a unique breed when it comes to managers who have the experience on the business and the creative/marketing side. In the old days record companies would tell (managers) ‘Don’t talk to radio stations or TV stations!’ That was their control. I built these incredible relationships with TV and radio around the world. Now a manager’s role is more important than ever in marketing an artist. Our motto is always to try to do something that no one’s ever done before. I’ve always been an international manager and it was always important for us to sell records worldwide, tour worldwide and market our artists worldwide. I still think you have to go to all of those territories, but it’s easier to do it on a worldwide basis with the internet.”\n\nLippman began working with his son, Nick, in an official partnership in 2004, under the name Lippman Entertainment.\n\n“I believe I’m the luckiest guy in the world to have been able to work with my two sons and my brother in the same business,” he said in a Billboard profile in 2016. “At the same time, I wasn’t the greatest father because I was always on the road. So now that I have the opportunity to see them every day and work side by side, it’s been incredible. Nicholas is my best friend today.”\n\nLippman is survived by his wife, Nancy, and two sons, Nick and Josh.\n\nHis sons offered respective statements to Rolling Stone. “Michael was my mentor and the greatest teacher,” said Nick Lippman. “For over twenty years, we traveled the world and shared a bond that grew deeper with time. We spoke every day and often finished each other’s sentences. Our relationship was shaped by the work we did side by side, and a bond of love, trust and mutual respect.”\n\nSaid Josh Lippman, “Dad was a relentless advocate for his clients, his friends and his family. He was the person you wanted in your corner in any situation. He transitioned from bulldog to effortless charmer on a dime, often multiple times in a conversation, and never met a challenge he couldn’t solve.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:04:50 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T19:26:00.092678"}

In all, Season 5 is looking at 137.1M views since Volume 1 premiered in November. That already positions it as No. 4 among Netflix’s most popular English TV seasons of all time, although the streamer won’t officially place Stranger Things 5 on that list until all of the episodes are available. The finale debuts on December 31 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET.\n\nUnsurprisingly, all four previous seasons were also on the weekly Top 10 again — Season 1 at No. 5 (4.8M views), Season 2 at No. 9 (3.6M views), Season 3 at No. 8 (3.6M views), and Season 4 at No. 6 (4.1M views).\n\nSecond place went to Emily in Paris Season 5 with 13.3M views, which is basically on par with its debut week. Third place went to Dave Chappelle’s new comedy special The Unstoppable…, which had 9.2M views.\n\nInterestingly, the only title that really gave Stranger Things 5 a run for its money was The Great Flood, a Korean disaster film that took first place on the non-English film list with 33.1M views. On the English film list, Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch came in first with 16.5M views as families got into the holiday spirit. Second place went to Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery with 11.8M views.\n\nThird place, would you believe, went to Kpop Demon Hunters. Even six months after release, the film still managed 9.2M views for the week.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 20:10:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T20:48:48.713217"}

In this brutal marathon march known as The Long Walk, 50 boys selected by lottery must maintain a constant pace of at least 3 mph. If a contestant falls below the speed, they receive a warning; after three warnings, they are executed, or out, leaving only one survivor to claim riches beyond belief and any wish they desire.\n\nLionsgate released the film in theaters in September and it has grossed $62.9 million at the global box office. Its ensemble cast will be the recipient of the Independent Spirit Awards‘ Robert Altman Award next year.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAt the center of the script is local contestant Ray Garraty (Cooper Hoffman), whose journey alongside Peter McVries (David Jonsson) forms the film’s emotional core. Their relationship evolves from one technical competition into a soulful, brotherly alliance that serves as an act of defiance against a merciless system. To capture this unraveling of the human spirit, Lawrence utilized a strategy of shooting in strict linear order, allowing the audience to witness the actors’ actual physical deterioration and psychological decline as they walked tens of miles per day.\n\nThematically, the script serves as a stark metaphor for the erosion of the American dream and the financial nihilism felt across modern society. While the original 1967 novel was an allegory for the Vietnam War, the 2025 adaptation re-frames the story to reflect contemporary struggles with inflation, stagnating wages, and the desperation of people who feel they must risk their lives to secure a future.\n\nBeyond the sociopolitical commentary, the narrative explores the power of friendship to provide light in total darkness, examining how human connections can be forged even in a culture that thrives on carnage and division. By stripping down the world to primal sights and sounds, the script asks uncomfortable questions about human value and what makes life worth living when there is nothing left to give.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T20:48:49.028544"}

As the brand is gearing up for 2026, the year marks two milestones for the company: 20 years of “Hannah Montana” and “High School Musical,” where actors and musicians like Miley Cyrus, Zac Efron, and Ashley Tisdale got their start on children’s programming. For Brenda Kelly Grant, Senior Vice President, fostering and uplifting the industry’s upcoming slate of actors is key when it comes to future programming.\n\n“For my entire casting team, we remember that everyone we’re looking at is in a stage of becoming,” reveals Grant. “It’s our job to interpret the gray area. We have an initiative where we will actually help talent. For example, if we have really good actors, but they’re not so great at singing or dancing, we’ll pair them up as it gets closer to the testing process with coaches who can help them with the singing and with the dancing. Our objective is to remember that this talent is becoming. We want to create the very best atmosphere for them from the beginning of the audition process until hopefully they move to other places within our company.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThroughout the last few years, former Disney talent such as the Jonas Brothers and Selena Gomez have returned to collaborate with young actors on projects like “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” and “Wizards Beyond Waverly Place.” It’s an opportunity for young actors to gain insight into working at Disney, while also offering former stars the chance to explore what they’re passionate about on or off screen.\n\n“I think why they come back and work with us is about the opportunities and the scope of what the Walt Disney Company can offer them,” said Grant. “We have so many sandboxes to play in, whether it’s producing, creating, or doing voice overs. The possibilities are endless. It really goes through all of our senior leadership of just creating a best home for talent and being able to be in partnership with people to create what they want to see and what they want to feel.”\n\nWith the release of Season 2 of “Percy Jackson and The Olympians,” Grant is excited for audiences to see and connect with actors like Walker Scobel, Leah Sava Jeffries, and Aryan Simhadri as they begin to return to Camp Half-Blood. As the leads of the series, Grant is hopeful that the casting and work of younger actors at Disney Entertainment Television resonates with viewers at any age.\n\n“Walker was a young kid in the casting process, and now he’s like a man,” said Grant. “When I see Leah come to me and she’s like, “You know what? What else can I do?” People see themselves in our talent. They see their stories and their experiences, and the challenges that you face in the world of becoming an adult. They see the power and like what they’re doing. That’s really appealing to people.

The order specifically says the Medical Examiner can only provide findings to the “assigned investigators.”\n\nThe Reiners’ youngest son Nick was arrested on December 14 just hours after their daughter Romy discovered the couple’s maimed bodies.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nUnder suicide watch behind bars in downtown LA, the 32-year-old could facing the death penalty after being charged with two counts of first-degree murder with “special circumstances” on December 16 by the LA County District Attorney.\n\nNoting “the causes of death of Mr and Mrs Reiner have already been made public,” the LAPD said today “the order was sought only to ensure detectives from Robbery-Homicide Division learned of important information surrounding their deaths before the media and the public.” Aware of the optics in this extremely high-profile matter than has shaken and saddened the Hollywood community this holiday season, the cops added: “the order was not sought to undermine transparency.”\n\nWhile not unprecedented, sealing such records like the Reiners after they have been out there already for a couple of weeks is a rare development. Still, even in a creative community, cop shop and DA’s office used to spotlight crimes and cases, the tragedy of the Reiners’ deaths has hit intensely, garnering global attention and an almost universal outpouring of sorrow.\n\nThe Reiners’ official cause of death was revealed on December 17 to be from “multiple sharp force injuries” three days before. Five days after the long married couple’s remains were cremated, the Medical Examiner put out death certificates on both the elder Reiners, listing their demise as a “homicide” from “knife, by another.”\n\nThat’s all scrubbed from the Medical Examiner’s online portal and elsewhere now.\n\n“On December 24 at 10:30 a.m., the County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner (Department) received a court order, initiated by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), to place a security hold on Medical Examiner case numbers 2025-19480 and 2025-19481, Robert and Michele Reiner,” the Medical Examiner’s office said late Monday. “While the cause and manner of death were previously released on these cases, due to the court order, the information is no longer available. No other case information or records, including the Medical Examiner report, can be released or posted on the website until further notice.\n\n“The Department understands the public’s interest in these cases and remains committed to transparency when possible. Information will be made available once the court order is lifted.”\n\n(L-R) Rob Reiner, Michele Singer Reiner, Romy Reiner, Nick Reiner , Maria Gilfillan & Jake Reiner at Spinal Tap II: The End Continues LA Premiere in September 2025 Getty\n\nThe successful Christmas Eve sealing ask from the police comes as the investigation into the death of the 78-year-old A Few Good Men director and 68-year-old the photographer deepens with more details emerging of what actually occurred in the couple’s Brentwood home on the first night of Hanukkah. In part, law enforcement sources say, the sealing was sought to allow police an uninterrupted examination of the facts and timelines before a scheduled January 7 hearing for Nick Reiner.\n\nTo that, police are still trying to determine the sequence of events that led to what they believe were attacks by Nick Reiner on his parents in their home’s master bedroom earlier in the day of December 14, sources tell me.\n\nery publicly having struggled with addiction and the consequences of the disease for years, Nick Reiner had been living in the guesthouse on his parents’ property for several weeks before their death. The context of how the apparently quick stabbings occurred could proved essential to both the Alan Jackson-led defense and the prosecution – especially in terms of if the younger Reiner was aware or not what he was doing, as alleged.\n\nSimultaneously and with great sensitivity, DA Nathan Hochman‘s office is trying to set a face-to-face meeting with the grieving Reiner family, I’m told. As the DA said in the week before Christmas, he and his team want to sit down with the family, especially siblings Romy, her brother Jake and the adopted Tracy, to hear their perspective on if prosecutors should seek life in prison without parole for Nick Reiner or the death penalty.\n\nThe death penalty is rare in California but still permitted in such “special circumstances” such as what the younger Reiner has been charged with.\n\nNeither the LA DA’s office nor defense attorney Jackson responded Tuesday to Deadline’s requests for comments on the sealing of the Reiners’ death records.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:17:54 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-30T23:24:50.212045"}

Discovery looks set to reject Paramount’s amended hostile takeover bid due in part to concerns at the delay that could dog its planned cable spinoff if a deal falls through, Deadline hears.\n\nWBD agreed earlier this month to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix in a cash and stock transaction worth $27.75 a share as it packages the rest into a standalone publicly traded linear television company called Discovery Global by the third quarter of next year. Paramount Skydance is offering to buy all of WBD, which would mean pencils down on a separation as the broader deal works its way through a potentially fraught regulatory process.\n\nDavid Ellison-led Paramount has insisted that it has the easier path to approval and that may be, but some investors seem to feel that things are not quite as clear cut as they initially seemed. President Donald Trump, who has said outright he’ll be involved in a decision, is friendly with David Ellison’s father and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison but recently fumed at CBS about a 60 Minutes interview with Majorie Taylor Greene, calling Ellison-owned Paramount “no better than the old ownership.” Skydance acquired CBS parent Paramount in August. Trump described Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos as “fantastic” but also noted that a combined Netflix-Warner would “have a very big market share” in streaming. Further confusing the issue, he also said he opposes any plan in which WBD continues to own CNN.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWBD announced its Netflix deal in November over rivals bids from Paramount and Comcast. The NBCUniversal parent bowed out, but Paramount went over the heads of Warner’s board directly to shareholders with a hostile offer that WBD formally rejected. In an amended offer, Paramount added a $40.4 billion personal financial guarantee by Larry Ellison and raised its breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching Netflix. But it did not sweeten the base amount of the bid, which still stands at $30 a share in cash. WBD last said Dec. 22 that it was considering the revised offer. Deadline hears the board will meet next week and no final decision has yet been made, but it seems a rejection is in the cards.\n\nBeyond the personal guarantee, WBD’s board raised other issues including its need for financial flexibility pending the close, which Paramount said it had addressed, as well as a $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would owe Netflix if it switches lanes.\n\nSome WBD shareholders have said publicly that Paramount should sweeten its offer, which has a total equity value of $77.9 billion and an enterprise value of $108.4 billion (including net debt and non-controlling interests), and many Wall Streeters believe it will. Meanwhile, Par has been urging WBD stockholders to tender their shares by the new Jan. 21, 5 pm ET deadline. They can withdraw the shares at any time before then and the tender can also be extended.\n\nIf and when Paramount raises its bid, the question is whether Netflix will counter. Several media analysts told Deadline they think Paramount will ultimately prevail because it’s smaller than Netflix and needs the deal more. One called the race “neck and neck right now.”\n\nReps for WBD and Paramount declined to comment.\n\nBloomberg first reported WBD’s board meeting and pending decision next week.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:28:43 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T02:06:30.092088"}

By failing to properly label the YouTube-uploaded videos as “Made for Kids,” the FTC said, the company enabled the collection of data from children under 13 without parental consent.\n\nThe videos at issue were posted between 2020 and 2022, according to the FTC complaint filed by the Justice Department.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe DOJ had filed the FTC complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. In announcing the settlement Tuesday, the department said the court had ordered Disney, in addition to the civil penalty, to create a program to ensure proper compliance with COPPA on YouTube in the future.\n\n“The Justice Department is firmly devoted to ensuring parents have a say in how their children’s information is collected and used,” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the department’s Civil Division. “The department will take swift action to root out any unlawful infringement on parents’ rights to protect their children’s privacy.”\n\nCOPPA, which took effect in 2000, has recently been revisited in light of the rise in social media use among kids and teenagers and the ubiquity of digital content. An amended version of the law was passed by the U.S. Senate in 2024 but did not receive House approval. House Republicans have recently revived it and committees have been conducting hearings.\n\nDisney is not the only company to be found at fault by the government for its offerings for minors. Microsoft paid $20 million in 2023 to resolve claims that it violated children’s privacy with sign-ups for its Xbox video game platform. The FTC in 2024 put forward a recommendation that TikTok be sued for alleged COPPA violations.\n\nA Disney spokesperson said last September, “Supporting the well-being and safety of kids and families is at the heart of what we do. This settlement does not involve Disney owned and operated digital platforms but rather is limited to the distribution of some of our content on YouTube’s platform. Disney has a long tradition of embracing the highest standards of compliance with children’s privacy laws, and we remain committed to investing in the tools needed to continue being a leader in this space.”\n\nThe media company had no additional comment Tuesday when contacted by Deadline.\n\nAfter a settlement in 2019, YouTube started to require that content creators indicate if videos that are uploaded as “made for kids” or “not made for kids.” Content creators mark the videos or entire channels in such ways. The FTC claimed that Disney was told in mid-2020 that YouTube had changed designations on more than 300 videos to “made for kids,” but the company did not change its policy of a blanket designation at the channel level. The videos in question included content from movies like Frozen, Inside Out, Finding Dory, and Encanto.\n\nThe FTC’s complaint noted that the Pixar channel was marked as “not made for kids,” while the similar videos on the Pixar Cars channel was designated as “made for kids.” The complaint said that disparity “illustrates Disney’s failure to mark child-directed content as MFK when such content is uploaded to NMFK channels.”\n\nAxios first reported on the settlement last September.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:10:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T02:06:30.738368"}

The 2024 show hit a record low of 4.1 million viewers after reaching 4.5 million viewers the year before.\n\nThe Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nTrump is the first sitting president to host the Kennedy Center Honors, which celebrate “individuals whose unique contributions have shaped our world,” according to the organization’s website. This year’s honorees were George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, KISS, Michael Crawford and Gloria Gaynor.\n\nOn Dec. 6, the day before the event, Trump told reporters at the White House, “It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”\n\nTrump has set his sights on remaking the Kennedy Center in his image during his second term, even going so far as to rename the venue “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts” in mid December. The name change has been met with significant blowback, and several scheduled acts have canceled their upcoming performances as a result.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 03:17:40 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T03:44:53.083317"}

WBD has already struck an agreement to merge with Netflix in a deal valued at more than $80 billion.\n\nBut Paramount Skydance hasn’t given up and is making a tender offer to WBD shareholders. As this tug-of-war has played out in press releases and conference calls and Securities and Exchange Commission filings, WBD shares have soared more than 170% this year, albeit shares were at a low ebb, having traded under $10 for most of 2024. Bloomberg reported the WBD board will meet next week to formally vote on a response to Paramount’s latest offer. A WBD representative declined to comment on matter.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe WBD board’s expected decision is not a surprise given there have been no signs of a significant about-face in the panel’s thinking about which company is the best fit for Warner Bros. and HBO Max. There is also much industry intrigue about how far Paramount is willing to go, if at all, in raising the financial value of its bid higher than the existing $30 a share.\n\nParamount’s amended offer from last week largely dealt with the financing of the all-cash transaction. Software billionaire Larry Ellison, who is the father of David Ellison, took steps to address the WBD’s stated concerns about the sources of Paramount’s financing. Larry Ellison enlarged his personal stake in the transaction by making an “irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion” toward Paramount’s $108 billion all-cash offer for all of WBD. That includes CNN, TNT and a handful of other established linear cable channels that are now on track to be spunoff into a separate company next year.\n\nParamount’s amended offer of Dec. 22 also upped the breakup fee to match Netflix’s $5.8 billion figure, payable to WBD in the event that its deal does not clear regulatory review. Netflix’s deal is valued at just under $83 billion but does not include the linear cable channels. Netflix’s deal is a mix of cash and stock.\n\nIf the expected WBD board rejection spurs Paramount to raise its offer, then the ball moves to Netflix’s court.

The image marks a departure for the actor, suggesting a character defined by calculated authority rather than conventional heroism.\n\nNayanthara has established herself as one of India’s most acclaimed actor over a two-decade career spanning more than 75 films across Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada-language cinema. Her filmography includes women-centric successes like “Aramm,” “Kolamaavu Kokila” and “Netrikann,” alongside Shah Rukh Khan’s blockbuster “Jawan.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\n“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n“We all know Nayan as a celebrated star with a commanding screen presence, and a remarkable career spanning two decades but in ‘Toxic,’ audiences will witness a talent that had been quietly waiting to explode,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “I wanted to portray Nayan in a way that she’s never been showcased before. But as the shoot progressed I began to see how closely her own personality echoed the soul of the character. It wasn’t imitation, it was alignment. The depth, the honesty, the restraint, and the emotional clarity she brought were not performances layered on top of the character, they were qualities she already possessed. I found my Ganga, so brilliantly performed by her, and even more unexpectedly, I found a dear friend.”\n\nThe reveal follows previous character unveilings for the production, including Kiara Advani as Nadia and Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth, each presenting distinct visual aesthetics within the film’s narrative world.\n\nThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P.

Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\nProduced by Venkat K.

Whether it’s Domhnall Gleeson’s replicant boyfriend pre-dating grief chatbots, creepy social credits systems, or killer robots, Black Mirror is often the dystopian nightmare we come to recognize in reality.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWith that in mind, my ears pricked up when Brooker cheerily sketched out an AI vision to boost cinema ticket sales during an on-stage interview in 2025. He proposed scanning the faces of cinemagoers as they enter the theater and then using AI to cast them “randomly” in the actual movie. “So imagine if you went to see Raiders of the Lost Ark and you don’t know if you’re going to be Indiana Jones, or a melting Nazi,” he told the Edinburgh TV Festival.\n\nThis was August. Little more than a month later, OpenAI launched Sora 2, allowing users to insert themselves into infinite movie realms through its “Cameos” feature. The results went astoundingly viral. Brooker’s prescience had struck again.\n\nThe screenwriter touched on something fundamental about how AI content is being voraciously consumed as novelty. “It’s telling, isn’t it, that a lot of the AI-generated imagery you see is a remix of other things,” Brooker said.\n\nBut does it have the legs to walk into cinema theaters? The technology is there, but it’s fair to say that storytelling and audience expectations are not.\n\nAttempts to revolutionize the cinema experience through innovation have flopped. Theaters flirted with choose-your-own-adventure-style ideas (something Brooker pulled off on Netflix with Bandersnatch), with little traction. 3D is now largely seen as a gimmick. And in 2013, the Dutch film APP allowed users to synchronize and expand the storyline via their phones, but it did not make the switch to Hollywood.\n\n“People just don’t go to the cinema for this stuff,” says Sarah Atkinson, professor of screen media at King’s College London. Julian Hanich, professor of film studies at the University of Groningen, is equally skeptical. “The pleasure of watching a film is partly based on self-extending into a different world,” he explains. “If you are already part of that world through AI, that’s kind of contradictory.”\n\nIt’s perhaps instructive that the two exhibition executives approached for this Rendering column did not wish to speak about deepfaking their audience members into works of art. And Brooker would likely be the first to acknowledge the pratfalls of such an endeavor.\n\nBut that’s not to say movie studios are dismissing these ideas. The best indication of this was Disney’s shock deal to hand over characters from titles like Frozen and Toy Story to Sora, with the best user-generated videos set to be hosted on Disney+.\n\nIt’s not quite Brooker’s cinema vision, but who would have predicted at the start of 2025 that Disney superfans could star in AI-generated videos on the Mouse House’s own streaming service? It would have sounded very Black Mirror.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:52:30 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T13:56:53.201431"}

Smith, the study’s author and founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. “While it is tempting to think that these changes are a result of who is in the Oval Office, in reality, these results are driven by executive decision-making that took place long before any DEI prohibitions took effect. Many of these films were greenlit and in pre-production before the 2024 election.”\n\nThe study, titled “Inclusion in the Director’s Chair” and now in its seventh iteration, examines the gender and race/ethnicity of directors across 2025’s 100 top-grossing films, as well as analyzes trends including hiring patterns by distributor, as well as the average and median Metacritic scores by director gender and race/ethnicity. The report surveys a total of 1,900 films released between 2007 and 2025.\n\nOf the 111 directors in 2024, only three of the women (Song, Zhao and Tammi) have previously helmed a film in the sample. Just 24 women have directed more than one top-grossing film between 2007 and 2025. Top-performing women directors were Anne Fletcher (4 films), Lana Wachowski (4 films) and Greta Gerwig (3 films), while 21 women helmed 2 movies.\n\nLess than a quarter (24.3%) of directors in 2025 were from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in 2025. This figure is unchanged from 2024 (24.1%) and significantly higher than the 12.5% reported in 2007.\n\nAt the intersection of race and gender, only 5.4% of directors this year were women of color, but 2025 marks the first year where the number of women of color (6) outnumbered the number of white women (3). Furthermore, all of the women of color directors this year were Asian (Ganatra, Shi, Song, Kang, Hikari and Zhao); none were Black, Hispanic/Latina, Native American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or Middle Eastern/North African. Overall, women of color still represent just 1.9% of all top-grossing movie directors across 19 years, despite the fact that their films earned the highest average and media scores compared to white male directors, white women and men of color.\n\n“It is clear that when it comes to directors, hiring decisions are not made solely on the basis of performance,” said Dr. Smith. “If that were the case, then women of color would receive significantly more opportunities to work behind the camera in film. These results demonstrate that the quality of movies by women of color is not only overlooked, it is actively ignored.”\n\nBy distributor, Universal Pictures (9.4%) and Walt Disney Studios (8%) (8.3%) lead the way in terms of hiring women directors over the study’s 19-year span; meanwhile, Paramount (2%), Lionsgate (4.3%), and 20th Century (4.6%) hired the lowest percentage of women. In 2025, Walt Disney Studios attached 3 women directors to top-grossing films while Universal Pictures and “other” distributors attached 2. Paramount, Warner Bros. and Lionsgate did not have a woman director across the top films this year.\n\nThe report contrasts these results by indicating significantly higher percentages of women directing films in U.S. Dramatic Competition at the Sundance Film Festival (63.6% for 2026), directing television episodes (37% in the 2023-2024 season) and helming Netflix movies (20.5% in 2024).\n\nRead the full study on the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s website.\n\n[Pictured: Chloè Zhao directs on the set of “Hamnet” and Celine Song directs on the set of “Materialists.”]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T15:46:07.466233"}

Discovery, and you’ll notice the same handful of names showing up again and again, often together in the same deal. They’re investment firms with names like RedBird Capital Partners, the Raine Group, LionTree Advisors and Silver Lake. Most provide financing for these huge transac­tions, while others, like Moelis & Company, are pure advisors who help structure and execute capital raises.\n\nIf you don’t work in or near the gilded trenches of high finance, you might be ask­ing yourself, “What the hell is going on?”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“When you’re dealing with artists and film and music, it is as relationship-driven as I’ve ever seen,” explains Angelo Rufino, who, as head of special situations at the 41-year-old Bain Capital, works in the same sectors and spirit as those younger com­panies. “It is really important who you are, what you can add and bring to the table. I think at times that can be lost with the bigger firms.”\n\nOnce upon a time, corporate M&A was dominated by decades- and, in some cases, century-and-a-half-old Wall Street behe­moths that controlled trillions in assets. Then came the 2008 financial crisis, trig­gering massive losses that pushed some to the brink of ruin and others (e.g., Leh­man Brothers) into extinction. Survivors like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into bank hold­ing companies to gain access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window lending pro­grams and deposit insurance, subjecting them to stricter government oversight.\n\nThe challenges faced by the old giants were compounded by post-crisis federal regulations (via the Dodd-Frank Act and the Volcker Rule), which targeted specu­lative trading that created conflicts of interest with clients and required higher asset-to-debt ratios for leveraged invest­ments. As a result, the most aggressive strategies were no longer legal or profit­able enough to pursue at scale, opening the door for smaller, more nimble firms drawing on private equity, led by ambi­tious refugees from money center banks.\n\nMany of these upstarts developed a niche in showbiz. According to Carlos Jimenez, a managing director at Moelis & Company, the reason for this is very sim­ple: “No one ever gets bored talking about media, sports and entertainment,” he says.\n\nThat was especially true in 2025, when the most talked-about drama in Hollywood was not anything on the big or small screens, but rather Skydance Media’s on-again, off-again and, finally, on-again $8.4 billion merger with Paramount, backed by RedBird.\n\nRedBird founder and managing partner Gerry Cardinale says that the deal wasn’t necessarily the emotional roller coaster it appeared to be.\n\n“To a certain extent, it was business as usual,” says Cardinale, who retired from Goldman Sachs in 2012 and launched Red­Bird two years later. “Obviously, this was a very complicated transaction where, in a certain way, we had to almost buy it three times. [But] the one thing that has distinguished us over my 35 years [in the business] is that we’re persistent, we’re tenacious, we don’t get emotional about these things.”\n\nNonetheless, Cardinale agrees that this investment is uniquely significant, both personally and financially. It gives his company RedBird 22.5% voting power in the resulting company, Paramount Sky­dance, and Cardinale a seat on its board of directors. It puts him second in line behind Skydance Media founder David Ellison, who took the title of chairman and CEO, and his father, tech mega-billionaire Larry Ellison, who collectively control 77.5% of the voting power.\n\n“I looked at a lot of things and passed on them,” says Cardinale. “And what changed it for me was that you had someone like David Ellison, who is a true owner-operator.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time a New York-based power broker has gotten a hand on the reins of Paramount. In 1966, Austrian-born Charles Bluhdorn’s automotive parts man­ufacturing and distribution conglomerate Gulf+Western bought the financially trou­bled studio, eventually leading to a golden age that produced such classics as “The Godfather” films and “Chinatown.”\n\nUnlike Bluhdorn, Cardinale isn’t a Hol­lywood newcomer. As he’s quick to point out, this is far from the only significant showbiz investment made by RedBird in recent years. In 2021, it was part of a con­sortium that bought a significant minority stake in LeBron James and Maverick Car­ter’s media and entertainment firm Sprin­gHill Company, and the following year it committed a minimum of $100 million to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon’s pro­duction company Artists Equity. It’s also been active in the sports world, with bets that include paying $750 million for an 11% minority stake in Fenway Sports in 2021 and $1.3 billion for the full acquisition of AC Milan in 2022. More importantly, it’s been investing in Skydance since 2019.\n\n“Redbird, to a certain extent, is an intel­lectual property monetization engine,” says Cardinale. “We’ve had a long track record of being able to buy into IP-based businesses and effectively we underwrite them, reinvigorate them and reposition them for the 21st century for technological disintermediation,” where middlemen are removed from the supply chain, enabling more efficient and profitable direct-to-consumer transactions.\n\nOn the investment side, the results are clear: the entity putting in the money gets an ownership stake. But what do these firms get for their advisory services? Typi­cally, advisors collect retainer fees ($10,000 to $50,000 a month) and success fees (1.5% to 10% of deal value), with the larger deals commanding larger retainers, but lower success fee percentages. With a mega-deal like the sale of Warner Bros. Discovery, which has received dueling offers from Net­flix and Paramount topping out at $108.4 billion, the worst-case piece of the deal pie can’t help but be impressive.\n\nAnd what do the companies get from the advisors?\n\n“We basically do two or three things,” explains Jimenez. “We put our arm around clients during their most important trans­actions, and that typically is M&A when folks are looking to buy or sell. Also, cap­ital raising, which is when they’re raising debt equity or going public. And then we also have a restructuring business, which is good when things go sideways,” he says, pointing to the work Moelis has done with AMC Theatres, which includes advising on a $600 million strategic investment from Silver Lake in 2018 and its 2020 restruc­turing strategy. “If you ask [AMC chairman and CEO] Adam Aron, he’d tell you that we had a big hand in keeping his company afloat during really tough times during the pandemic,” he says.\n\nAfter serving as one of the advisors to Skydance on its Paramount merger, Moe­lis advised Netflix on its deal to buy War­ner Bros. Discovery, which was quickly met with a hostile offer from the company it just helped create. The Raine Group also advised Skydance on the merger (along with BofA Securities and, of course, Red­Bird), while LionTree and Rothschild & Co. advised Paramount, along with Centerview Partners, which advised the independent special committee of the Paramount board.\n\nBut when you untangle these deals, things tend to be a bit less crowded than they might appear to an outsider, accord­ing to Jimenez.\n\nOn big transactions, “there’s just so much to do in a short period of time, you often need a lot of help, but that’s not always the case,” he says. “Depending on the transaction, sometimes even on some of the big ones, there’s only one or two banks on each side.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:45:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T16:58:30.325937"}

This year, many of the big English-language titles that lit up Cannes and Venice have struggled to turn red carpet frenzy and long standing ovations into box office heat or sustained best picture momentum.\n\nStill, in a crowded, jittery marketplace, a Cannes or Venice berth is considered one of the last true power moves for filmmakers with ambitions for Oscars glory and global stature. Questioned by Variety about how the sluggish box office could impact studios’ festivals strategy, Barbera remained optimistic. “Getting an invitation for a big festival like Cannes, Venice, or later, Telluride and Toronto, is one of the most profitable way to promote a film and the international premiere of a film,” he said while on the red carpet at Marrakech Film Festival. “I think that the studio will keep on attending big festivals with their best films, for sure.”\n\nAnd 2026 is shaping up to offer Fremaux and Barbera many attractive options that could garner an impressive roster of stars. These include Steven Spielberg’s UFO movie “Disclosure Day,” starring Emily Blunt and Josh O’Connor; Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s “Digger” with Tom Cruise; David Fincher’s “The Adventures of Cliff Booth” starring Brad Pitt; Ruben Östlund’s “The Entertainment System Is Down” with Keanu Reeves and Kirsten Dunst; and Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Three” headlined by Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya. The 2026 festival pipeline is stacked — at least on paper.\n\nWe’ve limited our wishlist to 10 titles, but there’re many more films from revered auteurs which we expect to see launch at either Cannes or Venice, notably “Minotaur” from Andrey Zvyagintsev, the two-time Oscar-nominated Russian filmmaker of “Loveless” and “Leviathan.”; “Sheep in the Box” (already bought by Neon) or “Look Back” from Palme d’Or-winning Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda; Quentin Dupieux’s Paris-set film “Full Phil” sarring Woody Harrelson and Kristen Stewart; “The Unknown,” starring Lea Seydoux and directed by Arthur Harari who won an Oscar for the screenplay of “Anatomy of a Fall” (shared with Justine Triet); and Nanni Moretti’s next film “It Will Happen Tonight,” among others.\n\nBelow, Variety rounds up 10 of the most anticipated films (listed in alphabetical order) we’re betting could land on the Croisette or the Lido next year, assuming the courting pays off and the stars align.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:15:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T17:28:08.589183"}

The teary-eyed Thor who appears in the “Doomsday” teaser praying before battle is miles away from the wise-cracking goofball Thor became in the MCU.\n\n“Father, all my life I’ve answered every call, to honor, duty, to war. Now fate has given me something I never sought. A child, a life untouched by the storm,” Thor says in the “Doomsday” theater in an ultra-serious tone. “Grant me the strength of the old fathers, so that I may fight once more, defeat one more enemy, and return home to her. Not as a warrior, but as warmth, to teach her not battle, but stillness, the kind I never knew. Please father heed my word.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nGiving Thor his own brooding “Doomsday” teaser sends a clear message to Marvel fans that the superhero is changing tone for his return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While “Love and Thunder” earned a robust $760 million worldwide in summer 2022, it polarized fans by pushing Thor to the limit of silliness. Even Hemsworth criticized the movie, admitting in a 2023 GQ magazine profile that “Love and Thunder” was “too silly” for its own good.\n\n“I think we just had too much fun. It just became too silly,” Hemsworth said about the movie. “It’s always hard being in the center of it and having any real perspective…I love the process, it’s always a ride. But you just don’t know how people are going to respond.”\n\nHemsworth said his biggest critics were his son’s friends. “It’s a bunch of eight-year-olds critiquing my film. ‘We thought this one had too much humor, the action was cool but the VFX weren’t as good,’” he said. “I cringe and laugh equally at it.”\n\nThe actor doubled down a year later in Vanity Fair’s May 2024 issue, saying: “I got caught up in the improv and the wackiness, and I became a parody of myself. I didn’t stick the landing.”\n\nHemsworth added he grew frustrated with the character while playing him in four standalone Marvel films and additional “Avengers” movies, explaining: “Sometimes I felt like a security guard for the team. I would read everyone else’s lines, and go, ‘Oh, they got way cooler stuff. They’re having more fun. What’s my character doing?’ It was always about, ‘You’ve got the wig on. You’ve got the muscles. You’ve got the costume. Where’s the lighting?’ Yeah, I’m part of this big thing, but I’m probably pretty replaceable.”\n\nDespite the self-criticism, Hemsworth was always clear that he wanted to give Thor another shot and gives fans the God of Thunder they deserve after the misstep of “Love and Thunder.” He also told Entertainment Weekly in 2023 that his next Thor movie would need to be “unpredictable.”\n\n“I don’t want to continue to do it until people are so exhausted that they roll their eyes when they see me come on the screen as that character,” Hemsworth said “If an audience wants to see it, and if there’s something that we believe is exciting and fun, then great. I’ve loved being able to reinvent that character a few times. I don’t have the answer yet, but I would love to try and [figure out] how we can do that again and keep it a little unpredictable.”\n\n“Avengers: Doomsday” opens in theaters Dec. 18, 2026.

As photographers, journalists and publicists huddle around them in scarves and beanies, the hosts power through photo ops and interviews, sustaining the same charisma and smiles that families have grown accustomed to watching at the end of every year.\n\n“Any chance we can take this interview inside?” Seacrest quipped to Variety. “What’s great is families don’t have to leave the house for all the excitement.

West Coast performers include Mariah Carey, Demi Lovato, OneRepublic, 50 Cent, Charlie Puth, and Huntr/x from “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n\n\n\n“You just know everyone’s going to be tuning in this year,” Ora said. It’s the British singer’s third year hosting the holiday event. For Seacrest, it’s his 21st.\n\nThis year hits differently for Seacrest. His father, Gary, died in October after a long battle with prostate cancer. “This was a tough year. I lost my best friend,” he says, noting that time with family has reshaped what this night means to him. “People want to feel good. You can watch this show and you can feel alright for a few hours. And then you can set the scene for a big start in the new year.”\n\nOra, with a fourth studio record and tour on the horizon, is approaching 2026 with intention. “It’s about getting in tune with my creativity,” she says. “Where I want to take it next year. I’ve been so inspired by the music coming out. I just want to see where that leads.” But she’s not ready to tease the music just yet. She kindly (but firmly) shut down the opportunity to tease what the sound of her new album will be like.

Thunderous spectacles unfurled alongside hushed, inward-facing character studies. Some films swung wildly and missed — gloriously so — while others landed with such quiet authority, they seemed to rearrange the room. It was a year defined by daring, by filmmakers who trusted audiences to lean in rather than sit back.\n\nStart with the consensus triumphs — films that felt instantly canonical.\n\nChloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” is a masterwork of grief rendered as poetry. Jessie Buckley delivers a performance of almost unbearable emotional clarity as a mother splintered by loss, yet somehow still breathing.\n\nRyan Coogler’s “Sinners” is something else entirely — muscular, ambitious and alive. It’s the work of a filmmaker proving, yet again, that his range knows no borders. Michael B. Jordan’s dual performances are feats of control and intensity. Breakout Miles Caton and the indelible Wunmi Mosaku provide the emotional ballast that keeps the film grounded even as it soars.\n\nStill, the pulse of my deepest excitement beats in Brazil, for the second straight year after Oscar winner “I’m Still Here.”\n\nKleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” is a slow-burning thriller that tightens its grip almost imperceptibly. Wagner Moura is hypnotic, coiled with tension and weary intelligence, while Tânia Maria storms in with scene-stealing authority. Meanwhile, Tunisian auteur Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is a gut punch — filmmaking that refuses comfort or distance. Saja Kalani, criminally overlooked, gives a raw performance of elemental power as an emergency call center volunteer in Gaza. And Oliver Laxe’s Spanish-language “Sirāt” is a fever dream that feels like the long-lost cousin of “Mad Max: Fury Road,” built for the biggest screen you can find.\n\nThen there are the films fighting for oxygen, the ones that slipped through the cracks or hovered just outside the safety of consensus.\n\nClint Bentley’s “Train Dreams” gives William H. Macy a late-career performance of startling grace, a meditation on American solitude etched into every line of his face. Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia” divided audiences with its trademark strangeness. Still, Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons are mesmerizing together, while Aidan Delbis announces himself as a talent of rare specificity and soul. Rian Johnson’s latest “Knives Out” whodunit, “Wake Up Dead Man,” offers Josh O’Connor another showcase for his chameleonic range, while James Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg” sees Russell Crowe delivering his most commanding work in two decades in a historical drama that feels uncomfortably contemporary. And the discovery of multi-hyphenate Eva Victor with the poignantly moving “Sorry, Baby” is a moment we’re taking for granted.\n\nIf I had an Oscar ballot, I’d use it to honor films that risked misunderstanding, performances that revealed something frightening or tender about being human and directors who believed audiences would meet them halfway.\n\nWe can’t forget about the best of TV.\n\nTelevision is considered here with the same rigor as the films championed, and not through the mechanics of Emmy categories, but through cultural impact and artistic achievement. This list prioritizes series and performances that defined the year’s conversation, measuring critical distinction alongside visibility, virality and sustained audience engagement. These selections reflect television experienced in real time: debated, dissected, memed and argued over. It’s an Oscar-style snapshot of TV in 2025, honoring the shows and singular achievements that didn’t just excel, but dominated the cultural imagination.\n\nAlways nice to include a disclaimer. If a movie isn’t present in any given category, it doesn’t mean “I hated it.” Making the top five in anything is difficult. Every ballot tells a story about what we value in art.

Artificial intelligence continues to reshape the way movies, shows and music is made, roiling a business that is worried it will lead to more job cuts. Bob Iger is finally ready to move on from Disney (he pinkie-promises this time), setting up a succession battle for the ages. And Netflix and Paramount are locked in an epic fight over Warner Bros., a clash of titans — and egos — that shows no sign of abating. All of this is taking place as the box office is in a rut, cable is in free fall and the overall economy is teetering. So yeah, fun times!\n\nWe can’t say for certain what 2026 has in store, but we’re going out on a limb and channeling Nostradamus with predictions about the drama to come.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“The Odyssey” Will Be the Year’s Biggest Hit\n\nThe name on everybody’s lips is gonna be Odysseus. Some of the biggest franchises in Hollywood history are returning to screens with sequels and spinoffs to “Star Wars,” “The Avengers,” “Toy Story,” “Super Mario Bros.” and “Dune.” But the film that will reign above them all is based on a piece of IP that’s been in the public domain for millennia. Christopher Nolan’s adaptation of Homer’s “The Odyssey” will dominate popcorn season: Who but Nolan could put Imax tickets on sale an entire year in advance and have fans snap them up in record time? And if he could turn the creation of the atomic bomb into a blockbuster, having people show up for an epic survival story that dates to the sixth century B.C. should be a piece of cake.\n\nNetflix Will Win the Warner Bros. Deal\n\nThe year is ending on a major M&A cliffhanger: Will Netflix or David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance score Warner Bros. Discovery? It sure looks like Netflix’s to lose, having swayed the WBD board with strong financials, its status as the No. 1 subscription streamer and co-CEO Ted Sarandos’ promise to keep the studio putting films in theaters. But there’s some regulatory uncertainty about the tie-up, and Trump remains a wild card. Meanwhile, Ellison and ultra-wealthy dad Larry Ellison aren’t going away without a fight. But to prevail in the hostile takeover move, the Ellisons need to get 90% of WBD shares voted for their all-in offer. It’s hard to see that happening unless Paramount and its backers are willing to go higher than the $30-a-share proposal on the table.\n\nThe Next Leader of the Magic Kingdom Is …\n\nBob Iger (finally!) is exiting stage left with his Mickey Mouse gold watch at the end of 2026. Who will get the call? Wall Street expects the shortlisted candidates to be Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, and Josh D’Amaro, head of the conglomerate’s parks and experiences division. Walden has the entertainment bona fides; D’Amaro is a respected leader at the company. It’s possible the board opts for a co-CEO arrangement, but that doesn’t feel like the Disney way. The board could also throw a curveball — and hire someone from the outside. But the directors are surely doing their fullest due diligence, given how things turned out last time. Let’s give the edge to D’Amaro.\n\nCan Hollywood Get Its Arms Around AI?\n\nIn the Wild West of artificial intelligence, entertainment companies are trying to swing both sticks and carrots. Disney, Universal and Warner Bros., for example, have sued two AI startups alleged to have ripped off their intellectual property. And Disney is trying to control its own AI destiny by going into business with OpenAI. Ultimately, Disney is betting eventual technical and legal guardrails will let it participate in the gold rush — and not be sideswiped by the slop. Expect the rest of the industry to explore similar strategies.\n\nMeanwhile, the music industry faces its own struggles with AI. For a few months, it seemed as though the biz was on the same page in viewing generative AI as a looming threat to human creativity and compensation. In July 2024, Sony, Universal and Warner teamed with the Recording Academy for two copyright infringement cases against AI music services Suno and Udio. But as AI music has gone from fringe to foreground — Xania Monet, for instance, became the first AI act to debut on a Billboard radio chart in November — the majors have instead struck deals; by the end of 2025, Warner had partnered with Suno. The big three forged licensing deals with AI music startup Klay, and joined forces with Spotify to address issues with AI usage. The concern from artist and songwriter communities is valid — almost all of the deals were announced in amorphous terms. Proof of concept is likely to come in 2026, when the products resulting from these partnerships are expected to launch.\n\nBig Questions for the Small Screen\n\nIn 2026 all eyes will be on what two powerful ex-Netflix execs do at their new homes: Paramount Skydance streaming chief Cindy Holland’s ultimate vision for Paramount+ should come into view. And new Amazon MGM Studios head of global TV Peter Friedlander will put his stamp on that company. Meanwhile, as Versant kicks off as a stand-alone company, keep an eye on what its networks might do in live TV and program acquisitions. In broadcast, the future of CBS News under Bari Weiss will be a top concern. In late night, what happens on CBS after “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” ends its run (our prediction: The Eye network expands its 11 p.m. local news to an hour) will soon be known. In development, a hot topic will be the microdrama business — and how it might be adapted to TV. And the unscripted world is focused on runaway productions as more series find it cheaper to ship contestants overseas. Then there’s the looming specter of Hollywood strikes with the guild contracts expiring.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T18:41:08.608023"}

George Clooney, Denzel Washington, Kieran Culkin, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sarah Snook and Keanu Reeves were among the stars of film and TV who gave Broadway one of its starriest seasons in memory.\n\nAnd they brought big box office numbers (and big ticket prices) with them. For a moment there, it seemed as though Broadway, still not fully recovered from Covid, had found its saviors.\n\nTo be more specific, it seemed Broadway plays had discovered their saviors. Because the other major Broadway story of the year was the dismal reality faced by the Broadway musical. With the New York Times repeatedly shining a spotlight on the commercial failures of one highly anticipated musical after another — Smash, Boop!, Sunset Blvd., Cabaret, Gypsy, Redwood and, more recently, The Queen of Versailles — disappointing investors with multimillion-dollar losses, the future of the Broadway’s splashy, expensive stagings seemed (and seems) legitimately grim.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAnd yet.\n\nAs Deadline’s theater critic, I found that a look back at Broadway’s 2025 brings a welcome reminder that there was plenty to love on those Manhattan stages. Even if we push aside the new-ish productions that opened prior to the start of the year — Oh, Mary!, The Outsiders, Maybe Happy Ending, to name just three — a threatened-though-durable Broadway didn’t lose its ability to surprise, with more than a few 2025 productions boasting the wonderful performances and excellent craftsmanship that puts Broadway square in the mix of New York City’s entertainment and cultural gifts to the world.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my choices for the 10 Best Broadway plays and musicals of 2025. I’ll also include some misses and a glance ahead to the upcoming shows I’m most anticipating.\n\n1) Liberation\n\nThe Broadway cast of ‘ Liberation Joan Marcus\n\nBess Wohl’s wonderful play juxtaposes the heady, optimistic days of the Women’s Liberation Movement with the oppressive state of affairs that exists under the thumb of Donald Trump — even if his name is never given so much as a mention. Dreary? Not for a moment. Liberation is funny, poignant and, yes, liberating in its expression of the very human need for justice and freedom in an era when those words have been co-opted by forces who value only self-enrichment. Breathing life into the well-trod Memory Play genre, Liberation follows Lizzie (a remarkable Susannah Flood) as she approaches a middle age that’s filled with more questions than answers, particularly when it comes to her late mother, a onetime feminist firebrand who showed her daughter only her most domesticated, traditional mother-and-wife profile. In one of her direct addresses to the audience, Lizzie lays it all out: “This is a play — a memory play, in a way — it’s about my mother. For my mother. Who recently … Who’s not here anymore. And so it’s about her, and her friends, her beautiful friends — and a thing — this is important —a thing they tried very hard to do. No, a thing that they did, that they unquestionably did — so why does it feel somehow like it’s all slipping away? And how do we get it back?”\n\nWith the cast portraying a group of women in a “consciousness raising” feminist group of the 1970s as well as their 21st century selves, Liberation jumps back and forth in time, giving audiences a wide-ranging perspective on radicalism, gender roles, race, oppression and defiance. And yes, Liberation is as funny and entertaining as it is wise. Whitney White (Jaja’s African Hair Braiding) directs with confidence, signaling her arrival at the forefront of Broadway’s strongest players.\n\nLiberation is playing at the James Earl Jones Theatre through February 1\n\nBroadway’s ‘Ragtime’ Lincoln Center Theater\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of Broadway’s current fall season, the Lincoln Center Theater revival of the 1990s musical Ragtime should be seen as no less than director Lear deBessonet’s heartfelt embrace of a work that, frankly, had heretofore failed to stake its claim on the theatrical landscape. Too often lumped together with Titanic, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Miss Saigon and other bloated offerings of 1990s Broadway, Ragtime was rescued by deBessonet with a leaner, more emotionally powerful staging for City Center’s Encores! series, and like so many of Encores! better stagings Ragtime transferred to Broadway with its superb cast (led by Joshua Henry, Caissie Levy and Brandon Uranowitz) largely intact. In 2025, it finally found its proper place on Broadway.\n\nRagtime is playing at Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont Theater through June 14\n\nSadie Sink (on desk) and cast of ‘John Proctor Is the Villain’ Julieta Cervantes\n\nFew theatergoers knew what to expect with the announcement early this year that a Broadway newcomer named Kimberly Belflower had written a play that would combine elements of the Salem Witch Trials, Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, the MeToo movement, sexual harassment, Lorde and Taylor Swift, with a starring role given to young Sadie Sink of Stranger Things fame. To say Belflower, director Danya Taymor, Sink and everyone else associated with this magnificent production pulled it off is an understatement. With surprises aplenty — and a final scene that ranks among Broadway’s most invigorating send-offs of the 21st century — John Proctor is the Villain cast a spell that resonates months after its too-early September 7 closing.\n\nJohn Proctor is the Villain played at the Booth Theatre from March 20 to September 7, 2025\n\n4) Dead Outlaw\n\nAndrew Durand in ‘Dead Outlaw’ Matthew Murphy\n\nIf I could pick one Broadway production of 2025 to outlast a too-brief engagement long enough to find its rightful audience, Dead Outlaw would be it. The quirky David Yazbek-Erik Della Penna-Itamar Moses musical deserved a far happier ending than it unlikely inspiration, the real-life Elmer McCurdy, a turn-of-the-century wannabe train robber whose shooting death in 1911 was only the beginning of a very strange existence: His corpse, long thought to be a prop or a mannequin, was located in 1976 at a Long Beach amusement park when crew members of The Six Million Dollar Man made the grisly discovery while shooting a location scene.\n\nSomehow Dead Outlaw‘s creators made a discovery of their own: Ably assisted by a stirring (if often motionless) lead performance from Andrew Durand in the title role (check out his scorching “Killed a Man in Maine”), this musical went well beyond the macabre to find the humanity in a most unlikely place.\n\nDead Outlaw played at the Longacre Theatre from April 2 to June 29, 2025\n\n5) Operation Mincemeat\n\n‘Operation Mincemeat’ on Broadway Julieta Cervantes\n\nWhat are the chances that two musicals about corpses would wash up on the Broadway shores within a single season? And that they’d both provide such lively entertainment? Like Dead Outlaw, Operation Mincemeat is based on a real-life incident (and a real-life dead body). As resurrected by the British musical comedy troupe SplitLip, Mincemeat recounts a World War II exploit in which British intelligence officers concocted an outlandish scheme to trick the Germans: They’d dress the corpse of a recently deceased — and unclaimed — homeless man in a British royal marine uniform, complete with phony documents in the pockets that would divert the Nazis from the Allies’ true attack plan.\n\nMixing outrageous slapstick comedy, a Monty Python-esque love of wordplay and one of Broadway’s most poignant new love songs in “Dear Bill,” Mincemeat, like Dead Outlaw, proves all over again that in the right hands no idea is too outlandish to conquer the stage or the free world.\n\nOperation Mincemeat is playing at the John Golden Theatre\n\n6) Marjorie Prime\n\n(L-R) Danny Burstein, Cynthia Nixon and June Squibb in ‘Marjorie Prime’ Joan Marcus\n\nIf Dead Outlaw and Operation Mincemeat could be theatrical cousins, Marjorie Prime and Maybe Happy Ending at the very least could be something-or-other once removed. Both envision a future in which robots, for lack of a better word (these are not your Lost in Space tin men), become all but indistinguishable from humans. Which says a lot about humans, for better and worse. While Maybe Happy Ending won 2025’s Best Musical Tony at least in part by infusing its tale of “helper bots” with genuine heart, Marjorie Prime takes an altogether more haunting approach: What if you could purchase an AI hologram — a “prime,” in the word of playwright Jordan Harrison — that resembled a dead loved one, say, the elderly mother who just passed, and that could be infused with all the memories and mannerisms for which you grieve? Directed by the irreplaceable Anne Kauffman, Marjorie Prime (flawlessly performed by June Squibb, Cynthia Nixon, Danny Burstein and Christopher Lowell) suggests that few of us could resist the unholy temptation, and that all of our technological know-how won’t save us from our longings.\n\nMarjorie Prime is playing at the Hayes Theatre through February 15\n\n7) Little Bear Ridge Road\n\nLaurie Metcalf and Micah Stock in ‘Little Bear Ridge Road’ Julieta Cervantes\n\nEarly closings are never easy, but some hit more deeply than others. That certainly was the case with Little Bear Ridge Road, Samuel D. Hunter’s play about a cantankerous woman long estranged from her adult nephew and the life twists that bring them together again, however fleetingly. By turns brittle and compassionate, Little Bear Ridge Road showed us a generosity of spirit that could overcome even the most entrenched emotional barriers. The two lost souls granted a bit of grace were played by the one and only Laurie Metcalf and one of Broadway’s brightest new stars, Micah Stock, both under the unerring direction of Joe Mantello. So why didn’t this fine play produced by Scott Rudin and Barry Diller last beyond a scant 11 weeks? Rudin, of course, is no stranger to controversy or hard feelings, and the play’s less-than-happy ending might have dampened word-of-mouth, but the playwright, the cast and the director deserved a heartier Broadway embrace. Little Bear Ridge Road ranks right up there with Dead Outlaw in recent theater’s gone-too-soon territory.\n\nLittle Bear Ridge Road played at the Booth Theatre from October 7 to December 21, 2025\n\n8) Purpose\n\nThe Broadway cast of ‘Purpose’ Marc J. Franklin\n\nA Cat on a Hot Tin Roof for the 21st century, Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins’ Pulitzer- and Tony-winning Purpose examined the inner workings and emotional fine points of a Black family presided over by its civil rights hero patriarch and his tougher-than-she-would-seem wife. Seemingly based ever-so-loosely on Jesse Jackson and his sometimes errant namesake son, Purpose exposed the concept of familial legacy and obligation for the fragile deceptions they so often are. With Phylicia Rashad staking her claim as a Broadway director of high order, Purpose boasted a cast that more than met the emotional challenges laid out by Jacobs-Jenkins: LaTanya Richardson, Harry Lennix, Jon Michael Hill, Alana Arenas (in a remarkable Broadway debut), Glenn Davis Solomon and the invaluable Kara Young made for an ensemble that won’t soon be forgotten.\n\nPurpose played at the Hayes Theatre from February 25 through August 31, 2025\n\n9) Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York)\n\nChristiani Pitts and Sam Tutty in ‘Two Strangers (Carry A Cake Across New York)’ Matthew Murphy\n\nI’m still not convinced that title did anything for box office, but this charming British import by Jim Barne and Kit Buchan, directed and choreographed by Tim Jackson, would seem capable of rising above just about anything. Starring Christiani Pitts and Sam Tutty (in a winning performance that gives Jasmine Amy Rogers of Boop! and Louis McCartney of Stranger Things: The First Shadow some real competition for best Broadway debut of the season), Two Strangers is that surprisingly rare creature: a romantic comedy that actually works on stage. Need proof of such rarity: Recall the boredom and the cringe of The Last Five Years and The Notebook.\n\nPitts and Tutty play a soon-to-be aunt and her nephew (a Broadway trend in the making? See Little Bear Ridge Road) who meet when young and puppy-dogish Englishman Dougal Todd arrives in New York to attend the wedding of his long-estranged dad to a much younger woman. The bride’s New York-jaded sister Robin (the terrific Pitts) arrives at the airport to greet and schlep the wide-eyed Dougal. They meet cute (that’s where the cake comes into play), she bristles, he fawns, and pretty soon they’re ripping off that creepy dad and heading to a happy ending the audience has long seen coming. But do they? No spoilers here, but Tutty, Pitts and all concerned with the modestly staged Two Strangers are worthy of whatever good comes their way.\n\nTwo Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York) is playing at the Longacre Theatre\n\n10) Stranger Things: The First Shadow\n\nLouis McCartney in ‘Stranger Things: The First Shadow’ Manuel Harlan\n\nYou don’t have to follow Netflix’s Stranger Things – or, in my case, even particularly like it – to fall under the big-spectacle spell of Broadway’s Stranger Things: The First Shadow. A prequel to the goings-on in the series’ bedeviled Hawkins, Indiana, First Shadow brings something even scarcer on Broadway than romantic comedy (see Two Strangers, above): Honest-to-Vecna scares. Taking what struck me as a more grown-up, less Scooby Doo-ish pitch to the material than the series’ Young Adult leanings, First Shadow, written by Kate Trefry from a story by herself, the Duffer Brothers and Jack Thorne, brings technical achievement and a thrilling panache to a medium not exactly hospitable to the horror genre. Carrie tried and failed. So did Grey House and King Kong and Dracula and Jekyll & Hyde. First Shadow, led by the impressive newcomer Louis McCartney as a pre-Vecna Henry Creel, just might open the door to a parallel universe where stage fright has a whole new meaning.\n\nStranger Things: The First Shadow is playing at the Marquis Theatre\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nJonathan Gross in ‘Just In Time’ Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman\n\nTop 10 lists have to make cuts somewhere, so sincere apologies to Buena Vista Social Club, English, Just in Time, Oedipus, Waiting for Godot, The Picture Of Dorian Gray and the casts of Art (James Corden in particular), Call Me Izzy (Jean Smart, gripping), Floyd Collins (Jeremy Jordan, proving his Broadway mettle yet again) and Boop! (Jasmine Amy Rogers, rising high above the material).\n\nBroadway 2025 Misses\n\nKristin Chenoweth in ‘The Queen of Versailles” Julieta Cervantes\n\nSome were mere almost-there disappointments, some outright flops, but a survey of Broadway’s less-than-successful 2025 offerings should include:\n\nThe Last Five Years — Starring Nick Jonas and a deserves-better Adrienne Warren. Five years? Nah, it only seemed that long.\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross — It wasn’t terrible, but with a cast that included Culkin, Bob Odenkirk, Michael McKean and Bill Burr, the David Mamet classic should have soared to the rhythms of the playwright’s language.\n\nGood Night, and Good Luck — It was a monster money-maker, but c’mon, Clooney could have played Betty Boop and audiences would have lined up for the privilege. Imagine if Clooney had chosen to use his star power to spotlight a genuinely worthy project — the way, say, Sarah Paulson did with Appropriate or Keanu Reeves is doing with Waiting For Godot — rather than the stuffy, moribund, on-the-nose hectoring that was Good Night, and Good Luck? The same, actually, could be said of Washington, whose somber performance in the modern-dress Othello did nothing that hasn’t been done in any number of Shakespeare in the Park’s lesser offerings.\n\nThe Queen of Versailles — Oh, please. It had nothing to do with Kristin Chenoweth’s kind words for a slain right-winger. The musical is just plain tedious, full of forgettable songs, muddled intentions and dumb-to-the-point-of-surreal ancien régime flashbacks. I’m still not sure if this musical even likes Jackie Siegel, its subject-turned-investor, and I was paying attention. There’s a lesson in there somewhere, and its not about gilded ambition or lousy parenting or money can’t buy happiness. Maybe its about deep pockets and artistic compromise and wanting to be liked so intensely that you lose any chance for a Rose’s Turn all your own. And maybe someone, someday, will make a musical about it.\n\nChess — While audiences seem to like it, reviews were mostly mixed. Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher are certainly and without a doubt very, very loud (except, oddly enough, at the exact moment you want volume — Tveit gets all but drowned out by the orchestra during the big, indecipherable “One Night In Bangkok.”) Mostly this revival of the 1980s flop from Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Tim Rice, with Danny Strong’s new book crammed with inelegant topical references, seems to exist mostly to give reviewers the chance to offer some variation of “close, but no checkmate.”\n\nA Look Ahead To 2026\n\n‘Cats: The Jellicle Ball’ Off Broadway Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman\n\nThere’s some promising stuff waiting in the Broadway wings, not the least of which is Tracy Letts’ Bug (starring Carrie Coon and Namir Smallwood); Daniel Radcliff’s stage return in Every Brilliant Thing; John Lithgow’s turn as Roald Dahl in Giant; and Gina Gionfriddo’s Becky Shaw starring Patrick Ball, Alden Ehrenreich and Linda Emond. Two revivals will boast some intriguing pairings: Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman will team Nathan Lane with Laurie Metcalf and director Joe Mantello, and Ayo Edebiri and Don Cheadle co-star in David Auburn’s Proof. Acclaimed Off Broadway treasures Cats: The Jellicle Ball and Titanique should lend some downtown elan to midtown, while Schmigadoon! hopes to tap into the cult appeal of the Apple TV series.\n\nRoundabout’s Fallen Angels, pairing Broadway icon Kelli O’Hara with Broadway iconic to infinity Noël Coward, had me at hello, and Manhattan Theatre Club’s The Balusters, marking the Broadway returns of the great David Lindsay-Abaire (Kimberly Akimbo) and director Kenny Leon, boasts the kind of rock-solid stage cast — Marylouise Burke, Margaret Colin, Michael Esper, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Richard Thomas — that is the fever dream of every nonprofit theater company.\n\nThen there’s the upcoming Beaches musical (no judgments), director Sam Pinkleton’s Oh, Mary! follow-up a Rocky Horror Show revival, and the Broadway debut of Taraji P. Henson in Joe Turner’s Come and Gone.\n\nBut I’d be lying if I said my interest isn’t perhaps most piqued by what at first glance seems an irresistibly kooky premise: a Dog Day Afternoon stage adaptation starring Jon Bernthal (respect for anyone tackling Al Pacino’s “Attica! Attica” chant) and The Bear‘s Ebon Moss-Bachrach. And then there’s another screen-to-stage project in The Lost Boys, which has the opportunity to follow in the horror footsteps of Stranger Things: The First Shadow. Movies have a rocky history of being relocated to the stage, to be sure, but this vampire project boasts an intriguing team in director Michael Arden (Maybe Happy Ending), music and lyrics by indie rockers The Rescues, a producing team that includes actor Patrick Wilson, and a cast that features, among others, Hell’s Kitchen‘s Shoshana Bean, Tommy‘s Ali Louis Bourzgui and young Benjamin Pajak, one of the most promising young actors to hit Broadway in years. Before starring opposite Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill in the Mike Flanagan film The Life of Chuck, Pajak all but stole Broadway’s The Music Man revival from adults Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, and wowed Encores! audiences with his powerhouse, crystal-clear vocals as the title character in 2023’s Oliver! revival.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:42:38 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T20:47:48.399956"}

This was a bit of a slower start to the day than last year, when more than 25M U.S. viewers tuned in for Chiefs-Steelers to kick things off.\n\nWhile there were only two games last year, both hosted by Netflix, the NFL threw a third game in at primetime this year, which went to Prime Video‘s .\n\nAmazon got the Chiefs this year, although this time around the team suffered a disappointing loss to the Denver Broncos that was watched by 21.06M U.S. viewers, according to Nielsen.\n\nThat puts it in second place among the Christmas Day matchups, but it is actually the most-watched Thursday Night Football regular season game ever for Prime Video, eclipsing the previous record setter, Cowboys-Lions game earlier in the month, by about 2M viewers.\n\nBroncos-Chiefs also attracted a record high peak audience for TNF on Prime ever with 22.9M viewers at the top of the 9 p.m. ET hour.\n\nAs with last year, all three of these matchups had U.S. audiences that were a tad lower than the usual broadcast viewership that the NFL has attracted in years past on Christmas Day. In 2023, a Chiefs-Raiders game became the most-watched Christmas Day regular-season game ever with 29.2M viewers. The Eagles-Giants also took home 29M that day, while the 49ers-Ravens managed 27.1M.\n\nThe difference maker tends to be Netflix’s global audience, which helps the streamer tack on a few million additional viewers. While that helped bridge the gap for Lions-Vikings, boosting it just over these totals, it didn’t do much for Cowboys-Commanders, where U.S. viewership was down quote significantly.\n\nFor Netflix, this was year two of a three-year deal with the NFL to broadcast NFL football games on Christmas Day. Under the deal, the streamer gets at least one game each year. Christmas falls on a Friday rather than a Thursday in 2026, so Prime Video is unlikely to host again. However, whether that means a game will default back to broadcast or find a home on another streamer remains to be seen.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 21:06:48 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-31T21:24:14.874269"}

EchoStar, meanwhile, started the year by merging with sister company Dish Network and ended it with its stock on a tear, up 370% for the year, due to a deal upping its stake in Elon Musk’s SpaceX.

On the other side of the coin, Comcast shares slumped 20% amid concerns about its stagnating broadband business.

The transaction created a new public entity for the company’s film and TV studio as well as a new stock for Starz. The latter had one of the best performances in the sector, rising 45% since its debut last spring.\n\nParamount, which is a reconstituted company with a new ticker symbol after last summer’s merger with Skydance, jumped 28% as investors processed the depth of its resources amid the WBD chase. Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle and one of the richest people in the world, is a key financial backer of Paramount and the proposal to acquire WBD.\n\nAmong the other comings and goings: pay-TV and broadband provider Altice USA rebranded as Optimum, changing its ticker symbol.

Here are some of the year’s highlights — or, let’s be real, lowlights — in that crossover zone:\n\nJan. 20 — Performers at President Trump’s inaugural events include such GOP-favoring artists as Jason Aldean and Kid Rock (who roars, “Is MAGA in the house tonight?”) as well as less obviously partisan Carrie Underwood, who takes the most heat from anti-Trumpers. She says she’s doing it because “we must all come together in the spirit of unity,” which in 2025 does not count as taking the temperature of the room.\n\nMay 15— Bruce Springsteen tells a British audience that America is “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.” Trump responds by calling Springsteen “highly overrated,” “dumb as a rock” and a “dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!).” The president did not lend the Boss any tangerine orange moisturizer tips.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMay 16 — Unprompted by much of anything, the president contends that music’s biggest superstar has gone from hero to zero under his withering social Truths: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” Three months later, as an addendum to his praise of Sydney Sweeney, he adds of Swift, “I can’t stand her (HATE!).” OMG, gag him with a spoon!\n\nMay 29 — In one of many conciliatory moves toward the hip-hop community, Trump pardons Young Boy NBA on a guns conviction. Pras and Diddy lobby for their own pardons (not yet successfully) since the’re being handed out like candy.\n\nOct. 8 — House Speaker Mike Johnson says Bad Bunny being booked for the Super Bowl halftime show is “a terrible decision… In my view, you would have Lee Greenwood, or role models, doing that. Not somebody like this… It sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.” We’ll see whether his math on the seats he needs to hold onto in 2026 is better than his math on Bad Bunny’s stats. Anyhow, way to court that Latino vote.\n\nNov. 7 — Trolling with the best, the White House begins a video meme campaign consisting of appropriating huge pop stars or hits for pro-ICE videos. Olivia Rodrigo blasts back: “Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” Sabrina Carpenter calls a meme using her music “evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” Tweeted SZA: “White House rage baiting artists for free promo is PEAK DARK.” Of course, for this administration, triggering the world’s most beloved stars is a feature, not a flaw.\n\nDec. 7 —Kennedy Center honorees including Kiss and George Strait come to the White House for a medallion ceremony. Gene Simmons, a longtime friend of the president, insists he is apolitical, but supports the president’s East Wing teardown: ““Have you ever been to Versailles? The American house of the people is shameful.” And he knows shame. So does Cheap Trick, which plays the Honors event to cover Kiss’ “Rock N Roll All Nite,” then lives to regret it every day.

Newsom simply responds by posting Megan Thee Stallion’s anti-Minaj diss track, “Hiss.” It gets weirder when Vice President JD Vance, the recent subject of supportive Minaj posts, tweets “Nicki > Cardi” — further establishing that all adult political life is like high school, just not not as mature or noble.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:12:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T02:28:18.396346"}

Below, find a breakdown of what happened during the last episode.\n\nEleven made it out alive!\n\nIt looked like Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) sacrificed herself when the bomb detonated, destroying the Upside Down and effectively closing the bridge for evil to appear. She even had one last kiss with Mike (Finn Wolfhard), and all of her friends and loved ones mourned. But surprise! Her sister Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) actually cast one last spell to create a fake Eleven, so it only looked like she died. In the end, per Mike’s estimation, Eleven is safe and sound on a beautiful hike, far away from anyone looking to harvest her blood.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBoth Vecna and the Mind Flayer appear to be dead.\n\nAs Eleven and Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) battled inside the enormous Mind Flayer, the rest of the Hawkins crew shot at and fought the big beast. Once Will (Noah Schnapp) jumped into Vecna’s mind to assist Eleven, both baddies — who, according to Henry (also Jamie Campbell Bower), are one and the same — received too many blows and were taken down. Joyce (Winona Ryder) delivered the final strike, beheading Vecna with an axe. Bonus: The little kids were saved, too!\n\nKali is killed.\n\nLt. Robert Akers (Alex Breaux) got off a shot at Kali right before Murray (Brett Gelman) caused a distraction by blowing up the helicopter. After this, Eleven killed all of the military men, and then took over Akers’ mind to make him shoot himself in the head.\n\nHenry Creel’s traumatizing cave memory is revealed.\n\nIt turns out that after killing the mystery man, Henry watched his younger self open the briefcase as a piece inside leaps out into his hand. Turns out the Mind Flayer didn’t want Henry to remember that he used him as a vessel to get to Hawkins — just as Will was a vessel for Henry. Henry disputed this, though, saying that he and the Mind Flayer were one and the same.\n\n18 months post-Vecna, things in Hawkins are pretty much back to normal.\n\nThe catastrophic events may have been swept under the rug as an earthquake, but at least there’s a memorial! We catch up with our crew after a time jump on high school graduation day. Max (Sadie Sink) is skateboarding and making out with Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). Hopper (David Harbour) is playing stepfather duties to Joyce and her kids, but takes time to comfort Mike, who’s still grieving El. Plus, Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) is valedictorian, and, of course, his speech is all about “Dungeons & Dragons.”\n\nSteve (Joe Keery) is now a high school sex-ed teacher and baseball coach — and Derek (Jake Connell) is a catcher on the team. In other news, Nancy (Natalia Dyer) dropped out of Emerson for a journalism job, Robin (Maya Hawke) is studying at Smith and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) is working on a movie at NYU film school.\n\nAfter graduation day, Hopper proposes to Joyce and suggests they move to Montauk, where he got a new job offer, and they could have a fresh start. Meanwhile, Mike, Max, Dustin, Lucas and Will skip an invite to a graduation party in order to play a D&D campaign that has a bittersweet ending which mirrors their own futures: Will heads to the big city and starts dating; Max and Lucas stay together; Dustin goes to college but still hangs out with Steve; and Mike becomes an author.\n\nThe last scene finds Mike watching as Holly (Nell Fisher), Derek and their friends start up their own D&D campaign.\n\nMike apologizes for not saying something earlier about Will coming out.\n\nIt was sweet to see Mike comforting Will at the top of the episode. Nothing will get between these two buds!\n\nSteve and Jonathan make nice.\n\nSteve and Jonathan let bygones be bygones, and both agree that neither is the right man for Nancy.\n\nHolly finally had her heroic moment by leading the kids to the cave.\n\nHolly felt so guilty about not helping her mother, Karen (Cara Buono), and not being brave at other points, but she made up for it in this episode.\n\nUnlike most blockbusters these days, there is no mid- or post-credits scene.\n\nThings are quiet in Hawkins…for now!", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:00:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T04:02:49.464908"}

This post contains details from the series finale of Stranger Things.\n\nStranger Things has officially come to an end after an emotional two-hour finale on New Year’s Eve.\n\nIt’s been a decade in the making, and throughout the final season, creators Matt and Ross Duffer have sought to answer all the questions about the Upside Down and the supernatural horrors that have been plaguing Hawkins, Indiana, since November 6, 1983. The finale kicks off right where Episode 7, “The Bridge,” ended on a cliffhanger with the characters set to face Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) for one final battle.\n\nThe plan was to attack him from all angles, inside his mind and also physically from inside the Abyss. The group runs into quite a few set backs but ultimately prevail, managing to defeat Vecna and the Mind Flayer.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSo, does everyone make it out alive?\n\nThe short answer is: We think so.\n\nAs soon as the crew leaves the Upside Down, they are confronted by the military. Hopper (David Harbour) and Murray (Brett Gelman) have already set the timers on the detonators, so the whole bridge is going to come crashing down soon.\n\nAs they’re getting apprehended, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) notices Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) is missing. He spots her standing just inside the gate to the Upside Down and tries to run to her but is held back by a soldier. El piggybacks Mike into her mind for an emotional goodbye as she explains that she needs to sacrifice herself in order for everyone else to be safe, otherwise the government will never stop their experiments.\n\nShe forces Mike out of her void in the middle of his pleas for her to reconsider her choice, just as the bombs detonate and the Upside Down collapses.\n\nBut wait — months later, we see Mike, Will (Noah Schnapp), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Max (Sadie Sink) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) graduate from high school. After graduation, they’re finishing up a Dungeons and Dragons campaign when Mike tells his friends a theory he has about their mage (which is what he used to call Eleven), who just helped save them from defeat. He theorizes that she didn’t actually sacrifice herself. As he’s explaining his theory, the episode flashes back to the moment the Upside Down collapsed.\n\nThis time, it shows Eleven escape with the help of her sister Kali (Linnea Berthelsen), who uses her powers to play one last mind trick on everyone before she dies inside the Upside Down. She makes everyone think El is standing inside the gate, when in reality she’s escaped into the tunnels and gotten away. The screen then cuts to El on a hike somewhere in a mountain range as Mike says he believes their mage stumbled upon a small, faraway town to hide in.\n\nCatching on to Mike’s implications about their friend, Max and the rest of the group are a bit skeptical, wondering how they might know if it’s true. Mike says they’ll never know for sure, but they can choose to believe like he does. They take turns vowing, “I believe” around the table.\n\nSo, if we take this at face value, then that means Eleven actually did make it out alive. It all depends on what you believe.\n\nOh, and thankfully the Duffers also confirmed that Ted Wheeler (Joe Chrest) is alive and well. It was up in the air after the Demogorgon took him out inside his home in Volume 1. We’d since seen Karen Wheeler (Cara Buono), but we wondered whether the we’d get to lay eyes on Ted again.\n\nDespite some close calls during their face off with Vecna and the Mind Flayer, the rest of the main characters manage to survive as well.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:37:44 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T04:02:49.787710"}

The 2025 rebound was fueled primarily by animated titles and IP-driven franchises, with 57 animated films generating over RMB25 billion ($3.57 billion) in revenue – representing nearly half of the year’s total gross. Leading the charge were local sequel “Ne Zha 2” ($2.13 billion) and Disney’s “Zootopia 2” ($558.3 million), which delivered exceptional box office performance.\n\nThe Maoyan Research Institute’s “Insight Report on 2025 China’s Box Office Film Data,” highlighted animation’s outsized impact on the market’s growth trajectory.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIP strength proved particularly potent in the animation sector, with select franchises recording significantly higher rewatch rates than market averages. “Ne Zha 2” achieved the year’s highest rewatch ratio, while “Zootopia 2” and other popular titles demonstrated sustained fan engagement and loyalty.\n\nThe report revealed increasing market concentration around tentpole releases. Among 2025’s top 10 new films, four surpassed RMB3 billion ($429 million) at the box office and eight crossed the RMB1 billion ($143 million) threshold. Local productions captured a slightly larger market share compared to 2024, though the number of local films grossing over RMB1 billion remained steady year-over-year.\n\nHowever, mid-tier local releases faced challenges, with films earning between RMB100-500 million ($14.3 million-$71.5 million) and RMB500 million-1 billion ($71.5 million-$143 million) showing marked declines, underscoring the market’s growing polarization toward blockbuster projects.\n\nLower-tier cities emerged as crucial growth engines, with third- and fourth-tier markets’ box office contributions reaching a five-year high in 2025, marking three consecutive years of expansion. The proportion of first-time and infrequent moviegoers also increased, broadening cinema’s audience reach.\n\nLocal productions shifted away from sweeping narratives toward stories reflecting everyday life, employing diverse visual styles and genres to meet varied audience preferences. Meanwhile, imported superhero franchises experienced notable declines, suggesting these properties require fresh creative approaches to maintain market appeal.\n\n“In 2025, several key holiday release windows outperformed expectations thanks to the support of breakout hits, setting multiple new records and delivering pleasant surprises to both the industry and audiences,” said Maoyan Entertainment market analyst Lai Li. “The traditional ‘blockbuster model,’ in its classic sense, is no longer a guaranteed formula for box office success, offering new lessons for market participants.”\n\nLooking toward 2026, Lai emphasized the industry must continue refining its content pipeline, attracting diverse audience segments with high-quality films combining popularity, strong word-of-mouth, and freshness to unlock further growth potential.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:18:39 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T09:36:13.830930"}

Unlike the 41 episodes preceding it, the finale was not exclusive to the small screen, as Netflix decided to event-ize the pop culture phenomenon’s send off with a limited theatrical release on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 across 500 theaters.\n\nThe earliest screenings took place at 5 p.m. PT, coinciding with the moment that the episode dropped on the streamer. While there was no formal red carpet premiere, the most sensational screening may have been at Netflix’s very own Egyptian Theater in the heart of Hollywood. Audiences donning Hellfire Club t-shirts, WSQK shirts, bowl cuts and other 1980s apparel from the show packed the historic theater, eager to experience their favorite show on the big screen for the first time.\n\nThe audience was a sea of nerds. Considering that “Stranger Things” began in 2016, the youngest fans in the crowd very well may not have been born when the show first debuted. Similarly, the adolescents in the theater were probably in kindergarten when the first season came out. Personally, I was in college in 2016, and have been watching the show for most of my twenties. To see the finale in theaters, surrounded by fans on the day of its premiere was thus akin to seeing “Avengers: Endgame” or “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” in the cinema on their respective opening weekends. It was the conclusion to a decade-long journey of fandom, and it made for moments that simply couldn’t be replicated in a watch party.\n\nFans attend the “Stranger Things 5: The Finale Fan Screenings” at The Egyptian Theatre Hollywood on New Year’s Eve.

As the Deadline team catches its breath before hitting the global film festival circuit once again later this month, here is our annual (non-exhaustive) list of U.S. and international movies we believe/hope will make the cut. As in our previous prediction lists, we’ve focused on titles that have already started filming or are in post-production and which haven’t yet been announced for a festival.\n\nThere’s always great interest in which studio movies could grace Cannes, Venice and other A-list festivals. We hear movies unlikely to debut on the Croisette, despite their early summer launch dates, include Steven Spielberg’s UFO film Disclosure Day (June 12 launch) and Disney/Pixar sequel Toy Story 5 (June 19). Christopher Nolan’s red-hot epic The Odyssey (July 17) is surely opening as a standalone summer blockbuster, with the director eschewing festival launches for many years. And just imagine the studio costs associated with getting all that talent to the Riviera! That leaves Cannes potentially short-handed in terms of major studio launches. But Thierry Frémaux often works magic so let’s see. There will still be plenty of high-profile pictures to choose from, as our list below reveals.\n\nLooking to the fall festivals, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s newly titled Digger, starring Tom Cruise looks possible for Venice, while Dune: Part Three has been dated for December 18, so seems to be removed from festival contention. There’s also a question mark over Netflix’s anticipated The Adventures Of Cliff Booth. David Fincher is reportedly still filming into January so he’d have to go some to be ready for a summer release (which was reported in one trade) but we hear that Venice isn’t off the table. Netflix often has a healthy contingent on the Lido, and Fincher’s last film (also for Netflix), The Killer, launched in Venice, and two of his last five films debuted at the New York Film Festival. Tom Ford’s starry drama Cry To Heaven is filming into the early spring and hasn’t set a studio partner yet so seems unlikely to be ready for a 2026 launch.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nCheck out our list below.\n\nPaper Tiger\n\nAdam Driver, Miles Teller and Scarlett Johansson star in James Gray’s New York-set crime drama about two brothers whose pursuit of the American Dream puts them on the wrong side of the Russian mafia. Expectations are high for a premiere in Cannes, where Gray has already debuted five features including last film Armageddon Time. Producer Rodrigo Teixeira proclaimed to Deadline in December that Paper Tiger is Gray’s best film ever.\n\nThe Entertainment System is Down\n\nRuben Östlund’s new film is one of the most anticipated independent pictures of the year thanks to its high-profile ensemble cast and the Swedish director’s Cannes Palme d’Or and Oscar nomination track-record. The dark satire is set on a flight between England and Australia on which the entertainment system fails, forcing the passengers to keep themselves occupied over the course of the long-haul journey. The large ensemble cast features Kirsten Dunst, Daniel Brühl, Keanu Reeves, Nicholas Braun, Samantha Morton and Tobias Menzies.\n\nA Girl’s Story\n\nJudith Godrèche rocked the French cinema world in 2024 with sexual abuse accusations against directors Benoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillon, turbo-charging France’s MeToo movement in the process. She is now gearing up to unveil her feature directorial debut adapted from Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux’s autobiographical novel. Valérie Dréville, Tess Barthélémy, Maïwène Barthélémy and Anna Mouglalis lead the ensemble cast bringing Ernaux’s flashbacks to life as she reminisces during a book-signing trip that triggers memories of the pivotal summer of 1958. Godrèche, who has been a regular guest in Cannes as an actress, hit the festival as a director in 2023 with short film Moi Aussi.\n\n1949\n\nAfter a lengthy break, Oscar-winning Polish filmmaker Paweł Pawlikowski is back with this Cold War drama co-starring Hanns Zischler and Sandra Hüller as writer Thomas Mann and his daughter Erika, an actress, journalist, and rally driver. Based on the 2021 novel The Magician by Colm Tóibín, the feature follows the Manns on a road trip they took across Germany in 1949 from Frankfurt in West Germany to Weimar, East Germany. Pawlikowski was last on the festival in 2018 with Cold War which played in competition in Cannes and was then nominated for three Oscars.\n\nOut of This World Andergraun Films\n\nOut of This World\n\nAfter Tahiti-set Pacification and bullfighting doc Afternoons of Solitude, Cannes and San Sebastian regular Albert Serra delves into geopolitics, with this tale of an American delegation on a mission to Russia during the Ukrainian war. Riley Keough features in the cast alongside F. Murray Abraham, Evgeniya Gromova and Liza Yankovskaia.\n\nThe Adventures Of Cliff Booth\n\nFirst revealed by Deadline in June, Netflix’s film continues the story of Brad Pitt’s character from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. David Fincher directs, with Quentin Tarantino’s blessing and the latter’s script. Also in the cast are Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Elizabeth Debicki, Carla Cugino and Scott Caan. What’s not to like? The fall festivals would kill to have the movie. Netflix always has a healthy contingent on the Lido. Could this be part of the 2026 class?\n\nDigger\n\nWarner Bros and Legendary’s new Tom Cruise movie directed by four-time Oscar winner Alejandro González Iñárritu has newly been titled Digger and will hit theaters on Oct 2, 2026 — that’s the prized frame where Warner Bros/DC’s Joker bowed in 2019 after world premiering in Venice. Expectations are high for the film described as “a comedy of catastrophic proportions.” Fall festivals are likely in the discussion at the moment.\n\nThe Unknown\n\nFrench director Arthur Harari drew widespread praise for Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle, which premiered in Cannes Un Certain Regard in 2021, and then shared the Best Original Screenplay Oscar with Justine Triet for Anatomy of a Fall in 2024. His third feature adapts his graphic novel The Case of David Zimmerman, co-written with brother Lucas Harari. The fantasy drama revolves around the titular David, a reclusive photographer who wakes up on New Year’s Day to find himself in the body of a woman he clocked at a party the previous night. The cast features Léa Seydoux and Niels Schneider.\n\nGentle Monster\n\nAustrian director Marie Kreutzer won acclaim for historical drama Corsage, starring Vicky Krieps as Empress Elisabeth of Austria, or Sisi, which played in Un Certain Regard in 2022 and was then Austria’s Oscar entry. Her new drama stars Léa Seydoux as a renowned pianist who relocates with her family to the countryside and then uncovers a life-shattering truth that forces her to confront the complexities of love and trust. The cast also features Jella Haase (Chantal in Fairyland), Laurence Rupp (Veni, Vidi, Vici) and Catherine Deneuve.\n\nRosalind Eleaza\n\nMisty Green (working title)\n\nRosalind Eleazar (Slow Horses) stars as talented actress Misty Green who is attempting to re-set a career derailed by her vices in this original feature written and directed by Chris Rock. The stand-up and actor also appears in the role of film director Jordan (Rock), who offers Misty a role that would be perfect for her if it were not for their contentious past. The cast also features Adam Driver, Daniel Kaluuya, and Anna Kendrick.\n\nParallel Tales\n\nIranian director Asghar Farhadi returns to France for a second time after 2013 couple drama The Past. His new French-language drama gathers a high-profile ensemble cast topped by Isabelle Huppert, Virginie Efira, Vincent Cassel, Pierre Niney and Adam Bessa, with Catherine Deneuve also putting in a brief appearance. The film’s storyline was being kept under wraps until Cassel revealed in an interview over the summer that it is inspired by the Paris 2015 terror attacks and that he plays a S.W.A.T officer. Farhadi, who won Oscars for his Iran-set features A Separation (2012) and The Salesman (2018,) vowed in 2024 that he would no longer make films at home until the country’s Islamic Republic government lifts draconian rules around women’s rights and attire.\n\nCristian Mungiu on the set of Fjord Goodfellas\n\nFjord\n\nRomanian director Cristian Mungiu’s English-language debut co-stars Sebastian Stan (The Apprentice) and Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value) as a Romanian and Norwegian couple whose plans for a new life in the wife’s native fjord village come up against neighbors with a very different outlook on life. The film, which features some Romanian dialogue, also marks a first for Stan who was born in Romania but has never acted in his native language, having grown up in Austria and then the U.S. Mungiu has played in competition at Cannes four times, winning the Palme d’Or for 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days in 2007; Best Screenplay for Beyond The Hills in 2012 and Best Director for Graduation in 2016. He told Deadline in December that he is aiming for a Cannes berth once again.\n\nAt The Sea & Place To Be\n\nHungarian director Kornél Mundruczó’s Hollywood currency rose in 2020 with English-language debut Pieces of a Woman after Vanessa Kirby was Oscar-nominated for her performance in the film. It remains to be seen whether Amy Adams will enjoy a similar trajectory as the star of his latest movie about a woman who takes refuge in her family’s beach home after a major life setback. Mundruczó is set for a high-profile 2026 with a second film, Place To Be, starring Ellen Burstyn and Taika Waititi, also currently in post-production.\n\nA Family\n\nCarice van Houten, Pieter Embrechts, and rising young talents Celeste Holsheimer and Finn Vogels co-star in this intimate Dutch-language portrait of two siblings caught in the emotional crossfire of their parents’ divorce, unfolding their story from mirrored perspectives as they navigate loyalty, heartbreak and the fragile path back to love. It is the second feature from Netherlands filmmaker Mees Peijnenburg, whose debut Paradise Drifters premiered at the 2020 Berlinale.\n\nWolfram\n\nIndigenous Australian filmmaker Warwick Thornton’s new movie is billed as a period western set on the 1930s colonial frontier. It follows three Aboriginal children who escape brutal servitude in the wolfram mines and embark on a dangerous journey across Central Australia in search of safety and a future they can call their own. Thornton won the Cannes Caméra d’Or for his first film Samson and Delilah in 2009 and was back at the festival in 2023 with The New Boy starring Cate Blanchett.\n\nLove Is Not the Answer\n\nJuno and Superbad star Michael Cera makes his feature directorial debut with this absurdist comedy exploring modern loneliness and the search for connection Pamela Anderson, Steve Coogan, and Jamie Dornan star with further cast members including Lucas Hedges, Julia Best Warner and Shirley Henderson. Deadline is told it could be ready in time for a 2026 festival splash.\n\nDeli Love\n\nA regular on the festival circuit with her short films which include Chopping Onions, Cheer Up Baby and Moving, New York-based filmmaker Adinah Dancyger taps into her Korean and Polish roots for this debut feature revolving around an unlikely bond forged between a Korean deli owner and a Polish-Jewish artist in her home city in the 1980s and continued against the odds across decades.\n\nLove Lessons\n\nFabrice Luchini, who won Best Actor in Venice for his performance in 2015 courtroom drama Courted, stars as a lonely retired literature teacher who reinvents his life in French writer-director Martin Provost’s eighth movie. Other cast include Chiara Mastroianni, Emmanuelle Devos and Carole Bouquet. Provost, whose credits include Séraphine, The Midwife, How to Be a Good Wife, was last in Cannes in 2023 with artist biopic Bonnard, Pierre & Marthe.\n\nA Long Winter\n\nRiding high on the reception for All of Us Strangers, Andrew Haigh has gathered one of his buzziest casts to date – featuring Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Caitriona Balfe The Amateur, Fred Hechinger (Marty Supreme), Kit Connor (Warfare), and D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai (Caught Stealing) – for this mountain-set tale of a family preparing for a long winter ahead, against a backdrop of absence and regret. Adapted from the eponymous novella by Colm Tóibín (Brooklyn, Return to Montauk), the drama began filming last October and hopes are high that it will be ready for a 2026 festival splash.\n\nLes Miserables © 2026 Curiosa Films – Eskwad – Studiocanal – TF1 Films production – Photo by Christophe Brachet\n\nLes Misérables\n\nFrance’s Fred Cavayé has promised an action-skewed revisiting of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables with his French-language adaptation of the 1862 classic novel. Vincent Lindon co-stars as ex-convict and parole breaker turned benevolent industrialist Jean Valjean, opposite Tahar Rahim as his nemesis, Inspector Javert. Further cast members include Camille Cottin, Benjamin Lavernhe and Noémie Merlant.\n\nThe Beloved\n\nJavier Bardem stars as an acclaimed film director who reunites with his unsuccessful actress daughter on a movie after years of estrangement in Spanish director Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s first movie in four years. Victoria Luengo (The Room Next Door) plays the daughter with other cast members including Raúl Arévalo (Pain and Glory) and Marina Foïs, who starred in the Sorogoyen’s 2022 Goya Best Film breakout The Beasts (As Bestas). In between times, the director made TV drama The New Years.\n\nFour Seasons in Java\n\nIndonesia director Kamila Andini’s sixth feature revolves around a woman who returns home after spending more than a decade in prison for killing the man who raped her. Finding herself unwelcome and marginalized, she unites with other outcasts as she reconciles with her past and carves out a new life. Andini has shown nearly all her films at the Berlinale with her last feature Before, Now & Then premiering in competition in 2022. In between times, she made the award-winning Netflix show Cigarette Girl.\n\nJia Zhangke Untitled Project\n\nSpeaking to Deadline’s Asia correspondent Liz Shackleton at the Pingyao International Film Festival in September, Chinese auteur Jia Zhangke revealed he had written a screenplay for “a road movie without cars” following a journey across the China. He did not divulge further details but said he aimed to begin shooting in December 2025. The director was last on the festival circuit with Caught by the Tides which played in Cannes in competition.\n\nRiley Keough, Callum Turner Jeff Vespa, Getty\n\nRosebush Pruning\n\nCallum Turner and Riley Keough top the cast of Karim Aïnouz’s remake of Marco Bellochio’s 1965 satitical drama about family dysfunction feature Fists in the Pocket. Aïnouz is directing script written by long time Yorgos Lathimos collobrator Efthimis Filippou. Brazilian and Algerian filmmaker Aïnouz’s last three films – Motel Destino, Firebrand and The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao – all debuted in Cannes.\n\nLa Bola Negra\n\nSpanish duo Javier Calvo and Javier Ambrossi, who are known collectively as Los Javos, first made waves with genre-bending thriller La Mesias. Their second feature is based on an unfinished play by Federico García Lorca and revolves around the interconnected stories of three men across three different eras. Penélope Cruz features in the cast alongside singer-songwriter Guitarricadelafuente, in his big-screen debut, Cannes Best Actress winner Lola Dueñas (Volver).\n\nA Day In The Life Of Jo: Chapter Phaedra\n\nGreek director Jacqueline Lentzou’s second feature takes its cue from the unexpected death of a teenager in Athens, whose light does not go out. Lentzou previously made waves with 2021 first feature Moon, 66 Questions, which premiered in Berlin’s Encounters section.\n\nFleur\n\nFrench animation director Rémi Chayé’s last film Calamity, a Childhood of Martha Jane Cannary won Best Film at the Annecy International Animation Festival in 2020. With animation increasingly getting a splash in mainstream festivals, we’ve including his third animated feature in our list. Set in the beginning of the 20th Century, the work revolves around the fortunes of titular Fleur, a young girl who rebels against her life in a slum on the outskirts of Paris and seeks out the bright lights of the Belle Epoque capital.\n\nYellow Letters\n\nDeadline’s Baz Bamigboye reported in July 2024 that Ilker Çatak had wrapped production on his next feature, Yellow Letters. Çatak shot the film in secret and has been in post-production since then and is expected to hit the festival circuit this year The film follows a married actress and a professor of dramatic arts at the university in Ankara, whose lives are sent into a tailspin when they both lose their jobs due to “state arbitrariness”.\n\nJack O’Connell In Ink Danny Boyle\n\nInk\n\nHot on the heels of 28 Years Later, Danny Boyle delves into the events surrounding Rupert Murdoch’s acquisition of UK newspaper The Sun in 1969 and drive to make the then failing broadsheet into one of the country’s most read newspapers. He directs from James Graham’s adaptation of his Tony-nominated play of the same name. Guy Pearce plays Murdoch opposite Jack O’Connell as so-called tabloid king Albert “Larry” Lamb, the Yorkshire native hired to spearhead the newspaper’s transformation. Boyle has debuted multiple films at festivals but not all.\n\nBitter Christmas\n\nAfter winning the Golden Lion in Venice with The Room Next Door, legendary Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar got straight back to work with Bitter Christmas, a film about a woman who is abandoned by her partner during Christmas time. Almodovar reunites with Milena Smit and Rossy de Palma on the film, which is the Spanish giant’s 25th feature project. The film is set for a March 20 launch in Spain, so could play Berlin and would be a significant coup for Berlin head Tricia Tuttle, although the Spanish release does not exclude it from a Cannes release.\n\nCoward\n\nSet in World War One, Belgian filmmaker Lukas Dhont’s latest feature follows soldiers trying to keep up their morale in the trenches. Stirred by wartime rhetoric, each of them seeks their own path. The film is currently set for a May 2026 release in the filmmaker’s home country, so a Cannes debut is theoretically on the cards. Dhont was last at the festival in 2022 with Close, which debuted in competition and was then Oscar nominated as Belgium’s entry that year.\n\nDe Gaulle 1 and 2 © 2026 Pathé Films, TF1 Films Production, Belvédère, Ness Film, Beside Productions, Auvergne Rhône Alpes Cinéma\n\nDe Gaulle: Tilting Iron & De Gaulle: The Sovereign Edge\n\nDiplomat-turned-director Antonin Baudry revisits decisive episodes of World War II through the eyes of General Charles de Gaulle. Simon Abkarian plays de Gaulle and is joined by an ensemble that includes Benoît Magimel, Mathieu Kassovitz, Niels Schneider and Karim Leklou, Florian Lesieur and Anamaria Vartolomei. Dated for release in France on June 10 and July 3, 2026, we would not be surprised to see at least the first part play Out of Competition in Cannes. Pathé released a teaser in late December which promises a polished, high-octane movie.\n\nAll of a Sudden\n\nJapanese Oscar-winning director Ryusuke Hamaguchi followed in the footsteps of compatriots Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Hirokazu Kore-eda to shoot his latest picture in Paris, with some scenes shot in Kyoto. French-Belgian actress Virginie Efira stars opposite and Japanese actress Tao Okamoto in the tale of the bond between a Japanese theater director and the French head of a nursing home. The drama is loosely based on published letters written by late philosopher Makiko Miyano in the wake of her diagnosis with breast cancer.\n\nIt Will Happen Tonight\n\nLouis Garrel and Jasmine Trinca co-star in Italian director Nanni Moretti’s romance unfolding in Rome, Turin, San Sebastian among other locations. The film is adapted from short story Hungry Heart by Israeli author Eshkol Nevo, whose work previously inspired Moretti’s 2021 film Three Floors Up. Cannes would be an obvious berth for Moretti, who has debuted 11 films at the festival, beginning with Ecce Bombo in 1978, and including Dear Diary, for which he won best director in 1993, and Palme d’Or-winning The Son’s Room in 2001.\n\nWhere To?\n\nAfter a series of award-winning shorts including Auschwitz on My Mind and Seven Minutes, Israeli director Assaf Machnes makes his feature debut with this timely Berlin-set drama about a series of encounters between a reserved 55-year-old Palestinian Uber driver and a young, outspoken Israeli, who keeps getting lost in the city.\n\nThe Uprising\n\nSet during the English Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, Paul Greengrass’ period drama stars Andrew Garfield as legendary labourer-turned-rebel leader Wat Tyler. Principal photography began in September 2025, with filming taking place across multiple Bavarian and Franconian locations, as well as at the newly established Penzing Studios in Munich. Garfield is joined in the cast by Jamie Bell and Thomasin McKenzie among others.\n\nSoumsoum\n\nChadian director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s new film unfolds in a village where a young woman named Kellou is troubled by haunting visions. Feeling different from everyone around her, her world shifts the day she meets outcast Aya. As the villagers turn against their budding friendship, Kellou must stand up for Aya and face the hostility of her own people, while fighting to hold on to her freedom. Haroun is one of Africa’s most feted directors with notable films including A Dry Season, A Screaming Man and Lingui.\n\nArtificial\n\nFresh from their collaboration on After the Hunt, Luca Guadagnino and Andrew Garfield have reunited on this comedy drama set in the world of artificial intelligence and reportedly inspired by the company OpenAI and the tumultuous few days 2023 in which founder and CEO Sam Altman was fired and then promptly rehired. Garfield is joined in the cast by Yura Borisov, Monica Barbaro, Jason Schwartzman, Cooper Hoffman, Ike Barinholtz, Cooper Koch, Billie Lourd, Zosia Mamet, and Chris O’Dowd among others.\n\nJesse Eisenberg Untitled Musical\n\nJesse Eisenberg planted his flag as a serious director with 2024’s A Real Pain, which won an Oscar after its Sundance debut. He returns to director’s chair with this untitled musical project starring Julianne Moore and Paul Giamatti. A24 has picked up world rights on the project, which has largely been kept under wraps. We know nothing of its plot. However, production began in early 2025, so the film is theoretically prime for a 2026 debut.\n\nDaigo and Ayase Haruka in Kore-eda’s ‘Sheep In The Box’ 「箱の中の羊」製作委員会\n\nSheep In The Box & Look Back\n\nJapanese Cannes regular Hirokazu Kore-eda has two potential festival titles in the works.

Kore-eda is a regular at Cannes with Monster, Broker, Like Father, Like Son and Palme d’Or winner Shoplifters, which went on to secure an Oscar nomination.\n\nBy Any Means\n\nThe cast for Elegance Bratton’s latest feature is ridiculously stacked.

The film’s plot follows a notorious mafia hitman and a young Black FBI agent who team up to investigate the murders of civil rights leaders in 1966 Mississippi. By Any Means will be one of the hottest fall 2026 titles.\n\nEnemies\n\nAmerican filmmaker Henry Dunham is in a prime position to hit the fall festivals for the first time with his debut feature. The film began shooting in May 2025, so it will likely be in a strong position by the new year. The film also stars contemporary leading men Jeremy Allen White and Austin Butler. The film follows a relentless detective and an infamous contract killer who collide in a deadly game of cat and mouse.\n\nI Play Rocky\n\nThe tumultuous 1970s production of Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky is getting the biopic treatment in I Play Rocky from Amazon MGM. The film stars Anthony Ippolito as a young Stallone. The film was deep in production in October 2025, according to Amazon, so it could be ready in time for a late fall festival debut.\n\nLast Days\n\nFollowing successful runs at the Royal Opera House in London and the LA Phil, the English-language opera Last Days has been adapted for the big screen by artist and filmmaker Matt Copson, who co-created the original opera with Oliver Leith. Inspired by Gus Van Sant’s 2005 film of the same name and financed by Mubi, Spain’s AF Films, and LUMA, with additional support from Nina Pictures and Artemis Rising Foundation, the film stars Agathe Rousselle (Titane) who also starred in the original opera production.\n\nFull Phil\n\nFrance’s maestro of the absurd Quentin Dupieux opened Cannes in 2024 with his film-within-a-film The Second Act. His latest feature co-stars Woody Harrelson as wealthy American industrialist Philip Doom who travels to Paris to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Kristen Stewart).

The L.A.-based husband and wife team previously made waves with short films Alina and Maki & Zorro.\n\nOrient Adagio\n\nAfter a high-profile 2025 for Palestinian cinema on the festival circuit thanks to films such as Palestine 36, All That’s Left Of You and Once Upon A Time In Gaza, Maha Haj looks at another Palestinian reality through her third feature about a Palestinian filmmaker, born and raised in a refugee camp in Syria, who gets a residency in Paris to write his first feature. It’s a dream come true, but the weight of events back home sends him into artistic paralysis. Haj is a regular on the festival circuit, with her first two films Personal Affairs and Mediterranean Fever both debuting in Cannes Un Certain Regard.\n\nBehemoth!\n\nTony Gilroy shot his first feature since 2017’s The Bourne Legacy in 2025. Pedro Pascal leads a cast that also includes David Harbour, Eva Victor, and Olivia Wilde. Character details are under wraps, and the film’s logline remains locked down for now, though Gilroy has shared in interviews that the story revolves around a cellist. Gilroy’s star power alongside a strong cast will make this feature a hot title for festival curators.\n\nWild Horse Nine\n\nMartin McDonagh’s long-gestating feature Wild Horse Nine began shooting in March 2025, making the project a likely candidate for the 2026 fall festivals. Venice is probably the most logical home for the film, considering McDonagh has debuted his last two films at the Italian festival. John Malkovich and Mark Ruffalo star alongside Sam Rockwell in the comedy-drama, which has been kept under wraps.\n\nSweetsick\n\nA long shot, but still worth noting, Alice Birch began shooting Sweetsick, her debut feature as a director, in late 2025. The film stars Cate Blanchett and follows a mercurial woman (Blanchett) with a strange and piercing gift – the ability to see what others most intimately need, often at great personal cost – who sets out on a journey home.\n\nHere Comes the Flood\n\nDenzel Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Daisy Edgar-Jones are starring in this Netflix heist film from Fernando Meirelles, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind The Two Popes and City Of God.

The Plan B and Mubi co-pro follows a queer filmmaker who is hired to direct a new instalment of a slasher franchise. The director fixates on the prospect of casting the ‘final girl’ from the original movie, and the two women descend into a frenzy of psychosexual mania.\n\n\n\nJack of Spades\n\nThe new film from Joel Coen shot in Scotland over the summer and features a high-profile cast including Josh O’Connor, Frances McDormand, Lesley Manville and Damian Lewis. Little has been revealed about the plot but the film is speculated to be a period mystery potentially set in the 1800s.\n\n\n\nHer Private Hell\n\nNicolas Winding Refn’s first film since Neon Demon in 2016 shot in Tokyo and Copenhagen with a cast including Sophie Thatcher, Charles Melton, Kristine Froseth, and Havana Rose Liu. Plot and character details have been kept under wraps but the filmmaker has strong ties to Cannes. Neon is repping rights and handling domestic distribution, which is another potential Cannes signpost.\n\nPossible Love\n\nBurning and Secret Sunshine director Lee Chang-dong returns to directing after eight years. He reunites here with Jeon Do-yeon who won the Best Actress prize at Cannes for their film Secret Sunshine. The film follows the intertwined lives of two married couples leading completely opposite lives. As their worlds collide, fractures begin to appear in their daily existence. Netflix is behind the project so a fall festival is more likely than Cannes.\n\n‘Bucking Fastard’ stars Rooney Mara (left) and Kate Mara (right) Lena Herzog\n\nBucking Fastard\n\nWerner Herzog’s latest stars Kate and Rooney Mara, Orlando Bloom and Domhnall Gleeson. Filming wrapped in April on the project that marks the first time the Mara sisters have appeared on screen together. The movie charts the story of Jean and Joan Holbrooke, “two sisters who are so close to each other that they speak in unison, love the same man, and have the same dreams. They even make the same slip of tongue in unison. In search of an imaginary land, the Orkneys – where true love is possible – they start digging a tunnel through an entire mountain range.”\n\nBad Lieutenant: Tokyo\n\nThis sounds a blast. Neon is aboard for the Takashi Miike update of the Bad Lieutenant IP starring Shun Oguri (Godzilla v. Kong), Lily James (Pam and Tommy), and WWE star Liv Morgan. The U.S. – Japan co-pro has partners including Jeremy Thomas for Recorded Picture Company, Sam Pressman for Pressman Film, Naoaki Kitajima for Nippon TV and Misako Saka for OLM. Written by Daisuke Tengan (13 Assassins), the film will follow a corrupt gambler (Oguri) in the Metropolitan Police Force, who finds himself thrown into a tangled case after an enigmatic FBI agent (James) arrives in Tokyo to investigate the disappearance of a politician’s daughter (Morgan). Meanwhile, a deviant killer operating in the yakuza underworld seems to be shadowing their moves. Feels very Cannes.\n\nPerfect Girl\n\nAdeline Rudolph, Arden Cho, May Hong and Jeon Somi are among cast for this psychological thriller set against the competitive world of K-pop. Billed as Scream meets Black Swan, the film is based on a 2023 Black List script and centers on a brand-new K-Pop super group that’s preparing to be launched to the world at a massive concert. A group of girls have trained for years for only four spots, and the final cut is only a week away. The competition is off the charts. But when a talented and mysterious new girl is introduced at the last minute, things start to get strange — girls are being hunted and attacked one by one.\n\nAnimals\n\nYet another Netflix charge. This crime-thriller directed by Ben Affleck stars Affleck alongside, Gillian Anderson, Kerry Washinton and Steven Yeun. Currently in post, the film’s synopsis reads: “Desperate to pay their son’s ransom, a mayoral candidate and his wife resort to extreme measures, revealing dark secrets they never intended to bring to light.”\n\nLa Más Dulce\n\nLaïla Marrakchi made waves on the festival circuit in 2013 with Casablanca-set female-focused family drama Rock The Casbah, which world premiered in Toronto.

She returns to cinema with a drama about two young Moroccan women who head to southern Spain for a season of strawberry picking, only to find themselves subject to abuse and harassment. Against the odds, they seek justice in the courts.\n\n\n\nSafe Exit\n\nEgyptian director Mohammed Hammad’s contemporary drama takes its cue from the real-life killing of Egyptian Christians by ISIS in Libya in 2015. The film follows an introspective young man who is still coming to terms with the loss of his father in the massacre a decade later. Working as a security guard in downtown Cairo, his path crosses that of young Muslim woman. An unexpected friendship blossoms, offering a route to healing his trauma.

The film shot in Tunisia and France in September and October and is now in post-production.\n\nHeatwave\n\nFrench director Stéphane Demoustier was in Cannes in 2025 with The Great Arch, starring Claes Bang as Johan Otto von Spreckelsen, the Danish architect who designed Paris’s La Grande Arche de la Défense. He was back on set just weeks later for the shoot of this psychological thriller adapted from Victor Jestin’s 2019 novel of the same name. Unfolding against the backdrop of campsite in the Landes on France’s Atlantic coast, the feature follows a teenager over the course of a scorching hot day as he frets over whether a body that he buried in the sand will be discovered.\n\nMoulin Pitchipoï Productions/Studio TF1/TF1 Films Production/Umedia\n\nMoulin\n\nHungarian director László Nemes, who won an Oscar for Holocaust drama Son of Saul in 2016, revisits WW2 with this biopic about French resistance hero Jean Moulin. Gilles Lellouche (Tell No One) stars as Moulin opposite Lars Eidinger (Jay Kelly, The Light) as Klaus Barbie, the head of the Gestapo in French city of Lyon who oversaw three weeks of brutal torture which led to the resistance fighter’s death in a train bound for Germany in 1943 but failed to break his silence. Speaking to Deadline in late 2025, Lellouche carried a special responsibility\n\nLa Perra\n\nSet on a remote island, Chilean director Dominga Sotomayor’s new drama stars Manuela Oyarzún (The Good Life, No) as a solitary middle-aged woman with a painful past, who rescues an abandoned puppy and names her Yuri, the name intended for the daughter she never had.

The film has become another holiday juggernaut for James Cameron and Disney, which acquired the rights to all things Pandora when it bought Fox in 2019. It has earned just over $250 million during its first two weeks in theaters and has been an even stronger performer overseas. It should cross $1 billion globally in the coming days.\n\nBut the movie business didn’t have as much to celebrate as it hoped to as the year came to a close. Cinemas in the U.S. and Canada sold an estimated $8.87 billion in tickets in 2025, representing a modest 1.5% increase on 2024’s domestic revenues. That’s also short of the $9 billion that many analysts expected the industry to generate. Prior to the pandemic, ticket sales were on an upward trajectory, routinely nearing or topping $11 million, but attendance has yet to return to the same levels even as the cost of going to the movies has increased. The popularity of premium formats like Imax, which have higher ticket prices, has bolstered grosses even as fewer consumers have opted to hit up the multiplex.\n\nDisney’s “Zootopia 2” continued to be a force, earning $4.6 million to bring its domestic total to $337.9 million to take second place. “Marty Supreme” continued to be one of the few indie films to break out at the box office, earning $2.4 million on Wednesday to nab third place. That brings the domestic total for the A24 drama about a ping pong hustler (Timothée Chalamet) to roughly $39 million. The film, which has been acclaimed by critics, was costly. It has a budget of $70 million and the studio spent tens of millions more to market the picture.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn fourth place, Angel Studios’ “David” picked up $2.4 million, pushing its Stateside results to $58.5 million, while Sony’s horror-comedy “Anaconda” rounded out the top five, earning $2.2 million to bring its domestic total to $31.7 million.\n\nElsewhere, Lionsgate’s “The Housemaid,” a campy thriller with Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, earned $2.1 million, leaving it with a domestic haul of $56.2 million. And Focus Features’ “Song Sung Blue,” featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson as Neil Diamond interpreters, also earned $2.1 million, bringing its grosses to $16.9 million.\n\nTheaters are also leaning into alternative content over the holidays, with many screening Netflix’s “Stranger Things” finale. The show’s creators, the Duffer Brothers, announced that 1.1 million seats had been sold in over 620 locations, but Netflix did not announce grosses.\n\nThe New Year’s Eve box office tends to be sleepy, as many consumers prefer to eat, drink and be merry.

In the new CNN documentary &#8220;I&#8217;m Chevy Chase and You&#8217;re Not,&#8221; Chase opens up about his experience hosting [&#8230;]", "content": "A brief chapter in Chevy Chase‘s illustrious comedy career is his ill-fated late-night talk series “The Chevy Chase Show,” which ran on Fox for six weeks in 1993 and was cancelled after scathing reviews and low ratings.\n\nIn the new CNN documentary “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” Chase opens up about his experience hosting a talk show — and the disappointment that followed. “I never took anybody’s advice about how to do a talk show. I can do it, I kept thinking,” he said in the doc. “It was hideous. I just didn’t really have a sense of what you do on a talk show.”\n\nChase’s representatives and collaborators explained in the documentary that the show, which debuted Sept. 7, 1993, failed because it had “old-time” TV producers and needed a new vision. Plus, while Chase was a gifted comedic actor and movie star, he was less skilled in stand-up comedy.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nChase’s eldest daughter, Cydney, remembered visiting her dad on set of the talk show. “He felt nervous to me,” she said.\n\nAndy Aaron, a writer on “The Chevy Chase Show,” recounted, “The reviews were universally terrible, and Chevy literally would come into the writers room and say, ‘You guys are doing a great job. It is not your fault, it is my fault.'”\n\n“I don’t know how people like Letterman and others do it,” Chase said. “It’s beyond me. You can say, ‘Well, it’s interesting to have different people…’ Yeah right. We’re all the same, pretty much. It’s not that interesting.”\n\nThe staff found out the show had been pulled by Fox at the end of Chevy’s 50th birthday party. CAA leader Michael Ovitz, Chase’s agent at the time, asked him if he wanted to go a couple more weeks. “‘Couple of weeks?‘” Chase recalled in mock surprise. “I think we’re finished.”\n\nChase’s daughters talked about Chase’s mental health struggles after the series’ cancellation. “It was kind of a weird environment after his talk show,” said Cydney Chase. “I know my dad has been depressed. I knew that at a young age. That was sort of hard for me because I would go in and, like, tug on his shirt and he’d say, ‘Not now, honey.'”\n\nChase’s daughter Caley added, “One thing that was interesting about our household is that my parents were pretty open with some of the things going on that were deeper, depending on our ages. My parents were communicating enough to say, ‘There’s something called depression, and it is hard for people to get out of bed.'”\n\n“He would get in bed and not come out,” added Chase’s wife, Jayni. “I didn’t understand why.”\n\nChase would go on to star in a handful of films after the talk show ended, and eventually he would have a career resurgence playing Pierce Hawthorne on the sitcom “Community,” which ran from 2009 to 2014 on NBC.\n\nIn 1993, “The Chevy Chase Show” arrived in a moment of frenzy around late-night television. Johnny Carson’s retirement from “The Tonight Show” one year earlier opened up opportunities, and Arsenio Hall was already hosting a successful, syndicated late-night yakker, “Arsenio,” which was an immediate draw with younger, multicultural viewers in big cities. Distributed by Paramount, “Arsenio” was the first competitor to go up against Carson that stuck around and made a dent in his audience.\n\nThe Fox network saw “Arsenio’s” success and decided to take a swing with a late-night show. It marked Fox’s second attempt to establish a foothold in late-night. In October 1986, Fox Broadcasting Co. was born when it tapped Joan Rivers to host “The Late Show” in the hopes of taking on Carson with one of his longtime guest hosts. But Rivers’ show had a rocky run and was axed by May 1987. It was replaced briefly by the offbeat, proto-“Daily Show” newsmagazine-style “The Wilton North Report.” That show lasted about three months. After that, Fox was out of late-night, turning its focus to primetime and finding traction with hits like “Married With Children” and “21 Jump Street.”\n\nFive years later, Carson’s retirement set off the Leno vs. Letterman battle that ended in Leno taking “The Tonight Show” throne and Letterman moving on to launch a new franchise on CBS. Letterman’s “The Late Show” launched on CBS with great fanfare on Aug. 30, 1993, after Letterman famously had to wait out the rest of his contract as host of NBC’s post-“Tonight Show” hour, “Late Night With David Letterman.” (The open slot at “Late Night” eventually went to Conan O’Brien, who was famously renewed in six-week increments in his first few months.)\n\nSo into this mix came Chase to do battle against Leno and Letterman, who were both revved up to prove themselves as the top-dog in the time slot. The whole fracas was quickly dubbed “the late-night wars” in media and pop culture.\n\nEven though it was short-lived, the arrival of Chase’s show as a Fox network offering spelled the end for Hall’s show in syndication. That’s because a number of the stations that carried Hall’s show in major markets were Fox affiliates. When the Fox network decided to go for “Chevy Chase,” those affiliate stations were under pressure to drop Hall’s show to make way for the network offering. Most of them did. Despite Chase’s quick hook, the damage was done. “Arsenio” aired its final episode on May 27, 1994.\n\n“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” premiered on CNN on Jan. 1.\n\nHere’s the first episode of “The Chevy Chase Show,” via YouTube", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 20:42:13 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T20:49:04.645683"}

So the minute he said that to me, I had a way in.”\n\n“I wanted to figure out who was the real person behind the conflicted, guarded and somewhat fragile man we see on camera,” she continued. “What was behind the surface of his slightly intimidating superstar bravado? Was there any self-awareness there? Having interviewed Chevy at length, I have to say that yes, it’s all there – and a whole lot of pain and heartache too.”\n\nThe documentary premieres tonight on CNN at 8 p.m. ET/PT, making it accessible to both traditional cable subscribers and cord-cutters alike. Viewers can watch the film live through major TV streaming services that carry CNN, including DirecTV, Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV, both of which include the channel in their standard lineups and allow subscribers to tune in across smart TVs, mobile devices and web browsers. For those unable to catch the premiere in real time, both services also offer cloud DVR options.\n\nStream “I’m Chevy Chase and You Are Not” online here.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:15:28 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T23:25:53.733199"}

He was 67.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, Mulrooney was best known as a stand-up comic. He made his name performing at The Improv, The Comedy Store, The Comic Strip and The Laugh Factory.\n\nAndrew Dice Clay took to Instagram to remember what made his friend special.\n\n“Crowd Work was his thing long before it became a thing,” wrote Clay of Mulrooney’s talent for engaging with and doing bits about the audience.\n\nClay recalled seeing Mulrooney at Pips Comedy Club In Brooklyn, where they both started.\n\n“The owners Marty and Seth told me to watch him. He was really amazing at it,” wrote Clay.\n\nTo Mulrooney, crowd work was akin to cooking a meal.\n\n“I look at the audience as a spice rack,” Mulrooney said in 2010. “I know I’m gonna make a great meal; I’m just not sure of the ingredients yet.”\n\nAdam Sandler once told Joe Rogan that Mulrooney was one of the stand-up performers “you didn’t want to go after.”\n\nRemembered Sandler, “Mulrooney would just destroy a room. He was so loose and could dominate the room.”\n\nClay pointed out that, just because Mulrooney never achieved the same level of fame as he and Sandler did, Mulrooney was still great at what he did.\n\n“He was the last comedian to come out of that club that everybody thought would become a really really big star! Johnny was tall, good looking, An ex Boxer … he also had the ingredients… The discipline to get up there every night, the drive, the want and willing to go through whatever it had to be to claw his way to the top.”\n\nClay continued, “The thing I’m getting at is that he never gave up, he never stopped trying, which is what it’s all about in my book. Not everybody climbs to the top, and not everybody becomes a superstar. John was a great, great comedian.”\n\nIn the early ’80s, Mulrooney did stand-up on a TV show called Comedy Tonight. He went on to write and produce original content for 165 episodes of the series. Mulrooney also competed on the Ed McMahon-fronted Star Search. He lost, but was hired as a writer.\n\nWhen Joan Rivers left Fox’s The Late Show in 1987, Mulrooney replaced her. The show was, however, canceled a few months later. He also guest-hosted on The Pat Sajak Show.\n\nHe got another shot as the host of Comic Strip: Live, a TV version of a comedy club show filmed in front of a live audience. It aired locally on KTTV in Los Angeles before Fox brought the show to its owned-and-operated stations. Fox took Comic Strip: Live national on Saturday nights for a year before it ended.\n\nMulrooney also appeared on HBO, Showtime, A&E and Comedy Central.\n\nOn the big screen, he played a talk show host opposite Dennis Quaid in Great Balls of Fire.\n\nTrue to Clay’s testimony, Mulrooney did all this while maintaining a talk radio career.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the comedian co-hosted an Albany-based morning show with Bob “The Wolf” Wohlfeld on WPYX. Mulrooney joined the Poughkeepsie-based WPDH in 2010 before moving to iHeartRadio for “Mulrooney in the Morning.”\n\nAt 52, Mulrooney joined the Coxsackie Police Department, where he served through 2024. That led to a pilot for a reality show called Comedy Cop, following Mulrooney’s experiences as a police officer in a small-town.\n\nVisitation will be held at Casey Funeral Home in Staten Island on January 4 from 2-6 p.m.\n\nHis funeral will take place at the Church of the Holy Family in New York on January 5 at 10:30 am.\n\nIn lieu of flowers donations may be made in John’s memory to St. Jude Children’s Hospital.\n\nDEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:49:46 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T23:56:38.372239"}

It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or, we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe former “CBS Mornings” host said he has felt that “the most urgent questions simply weren’t being asked” by current TV news journalists.\n\nDespite his long career in the news, the incoming anchor’s statement Thursday was notable in that it seemed to agree with critics of mainstream media such as President Trump, implying journalists aren’t doing their jobs competently. In the statement, Dokoupil said he had talked to people around the country who questioned coverage of topics like Hilary Clinton’s emails or the president’s fitness for office.\n\nDokoupil, who was previously at MSNBC, The Daily Beast and Newsweek and joined CBS in 2016, could have a challenge ahead of him. When he was named to the “CBS Evening News” post by new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, Variety‘s Brian Steinberg wrote, “The job comes with a difficult mission attached. The program, which has ties to legendary personnel like Walter Cronkite, has been mired in third place behind ABC’s ‘World News Tonight’ and NBC’s ‘NBC Nightly News’ for years.” Dokoupil is likely aligned with some of Weiss’ views, such as her pro-Israel stance, Steinberg wrote.\n\n“I report for you,” Dokoupil promised, “which means I’ll tell you what I know, when I know it and how I know it. And when I get it wrong, I’ll tell you that too.”\n\nDokoupil finished his statement by promising to uphold the truth asking viewers to hold him accountable, “It also means I’m going to talk to everyone, and hold everyone in public life to the very same standards. After all, I became a journalist to talk to people. I love talking to people about what works in this country, what doesn’t, and not only what should change, but the good ideas that should never change.

It was a really important scene for us, and a really important scene for Noah — not just from a thematic point of view, but also a narrative point of view,” Ross Duffer tells Variety on Jan. 1 during a lengthy postmortem following the series finale. “This show has always been about our characters overcoming evil, and in order to overcome this evil, Vecna, in so many ways, represents all the dark thoughts and the evil of society. And for our characters to overcome that, it really becomes about embracing themselves, and then also embracing one another and coming together.”\n\nThe scene was “the final step in Will’s journey, and Will is, in so many ways, the key to defeating Vecna,” adds Matt Duffer. “Volume 1 is really about self-acceptance, right? I mean, that’s sort of step one. And then step two is Will is talking to Robin — it’s something that he wants to do. He’s trying to figure out how to come out, and he knows that he needs to do that, and that that’s the final step for him. And he finds the courage to be able to do it. And it’s really the ultimate fuck you to Vecna. That was the intention.”\n\nCOURTESY OF NETFLIX © 2025\n\nWhile the episode was torn apart online, that doesn’t change how the creators feel about it.\n\n“We’re proud of the episode, and we’re proud of the scene, and proud of Noah, who gave a really brave, very vulnerable performance,” says Ross.\n\nThe scene was extremely important for Schnapp, Matt says, and the three of them have stayed close amid the mixed reviews.\n\n“I think that’s where Ross and I were most sensitive, was Noah — because of how close to home this hit for him,” he says. “And our goal was to make sure that he was comfortable and happy with the scene. And when he was, we felt good about it. I’ve been texting with him a lot, but texting with him specifically after that scene and after that episode aired. And he’s in a really good place. He’s very proud of the scene, and we’re proud of the scene.”\n\nBut still, even in 2025, the online hate surprised them. “No is the honest truth,” Matt says when asked whether he’d anticipated the homophobic backlash. “Because it is, as Ross said, something we’ve been building for a really long time. I always say, Ross and I are many things, but subtle is not one of those things!”\n\nAfter the episode dropped, Matt also told Variety that the duo “spent longer writing” the coming out scene than any other — and that it was all about collaboration.\n\n“We were so concerned about getting it right. There were a lot of things that went into it. I mean, we’re definitely nervous about how it’s going to go over with everyone. But not as nervous as we were handing it over to Noah. Because ultimately, it needed to resonate and be truthful for him. We really were writing it to and for Noah. He wrote us sobbing after he read it. So it really worked and resonated for him, which was great,” he said. “On the day, frankly, there wasn’t really much direction at all. Noah spent a long time — I mean, months — prepping for that scene, that moment. Luckily, that script was done well in advance. I know he did a lot of work himself… And most of what’s in there is the first take.”\n\nKate Aurthur contributed to the reporting of this story.\n\nInside the Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down the Series Finale\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on Noah’s Coming Out Scene\n\n• Noah Schnapp on His Emotional Coming Out in Volume 2\n\n• Stranger Things Finale: How It Ended, Who Survived\n\n• Director Shawn Levy on Key Moments of Final Season\n\n• Noah Schnapp on His Powers Revealed in Volume 1", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 01:20:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T02:39:49.661992"}

And so ends the nine-and-a-half-year journey of “Stranger Things,” which launched in July 2016 and concluded on Dec. 31, 2025. Creators Matt and Ross Duffer wrapped up the series in a finale that ran just over two hours, and not only premiered on Netflix, but played in select theaters as well. In a media landscape that’s splintered into a million pieces, the conclusion of “Stranger Things” — with its finale dropping precisely at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on New Year’s Eve — felt like a throwback to an earlier time, and a last gasp of monoculture. “The Rightside Up” wrapped up the stories of all the major characters, after Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Will (Noah Schnapp), Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Joyce (Winona Ryder) and the rest of the Hawkins heroes went into the Abyss to defeat the Mind Flayer and kill Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) for once and for all. In Variety’s Oct. 15 cover story about “Stranger Things,” Matt Duffer said explicitly, “This is a complete story. It’s done.” Which doesn’t mean that every single plot thread was tied up in a neat bow, as TikTok will undoubtedly be telling us for the next few months (and possibly forever). The biggest lingering question that “The Rightside Up” leaves ambiguous is whether Eleven is dead (did she sacrifice herself when the Upside Down was destroyed to thwart the military from weaponizing future clones of her?) or alive (was that last image just a projection of her, as aided by Linnea Berthelsen’s Kali, and Eleven managed to escape?). Viewers will surely reach their own conclusions, but in the spirit of “Stranger Things” and its inspirations, Eleven may very well be alive. Courtesy of Netflix Mike (Finn Wolfhard) certainly seems to think so. The show’s final scene — after an 18-month time jump to the class of ‘89’s graduation — is set in the Wheelers’ basement as the gang plays Dungeons & Dragons one last time, in a throwback to the series premiere. It’s then that Mike tells Will, Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Max (Sadie Sink) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) how he sees their stories moving forward, as they each embark on their futures — and it’s where he tells them that he thinks Eleven might be alive after all. As his sister Holly (Nell Fisher), her friend Derek (Jake Connelly) and their other friends come barreling down the stairs, ready to take over the D&D game, Mike closes the door. (For Variety’s full recap of the “Stranger Things” finale, read this.) In an interview with the Duffer brothers on the morning of Jan. 1, they delve into the uncertainty of Eleven’s fate; staging the final battle with the Mind Flayer and Vecna, and debating who got to deal the death blow; the element unveiled in the finale that will be key to the spinoff — and being unpleasantly surprised by the review bombing of “The Bridge,” the series’ penulimate episode. The New Year’s Day conversation is interrupted only by Brown repeatedly trying to call Matt Duffer, which disrupts the Zoom. See, everybody? She’s alive! You’ve been clear that you’ve known for a long time that the final scene was that D&D campaign with the kids, who are now young adults. But how much of that scene did you know far in advance? Like, did you know Eleven wouldn’t be there, that Max would be there — break it down for me, please! Matt Duffer: Initially, when we came up with it a very long time ago, it was the kids — the “kids,” in quotes — play one final game of D&D, put their books away and go upstairs. And Mike was going to shut the door, closing the door effectively on childhood. So that was the idea. Once we introduced Holly, and this is one of the reasons we were so interested in bringing Holly and her friends and Derek into the show, was to be able to have a passing of the torch moment. To be able to recapture Season 1, it allows Mike to reflect on his childhood and feel happy that his sister and her friends are going to have a magical experience, or adventures like they had — hopefully not as traumatic. But as Dustin said, there was so much good amongst so much bad. It changed them in so many meaningful ways. Ross Duffer: Eleven was never going to be there. It was very early on in the writing process of this season that we figured out exactly how to tell that story and landed on the “I believe” moment. And once we landed on “I believe,” then that sort of cracked it wide open. That was in those first few weeks of the writers’ room, because we started at the end, at that basement scene, and wanted to make sure that we got it to a place where we felt was the right ending for the show. And then we built the season to that moment. Matt Duffer: I also love the idea that the original ending of “ET” was them going to be them playing D&D again. So I like the idea of doing that.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nSpeaking of the Eleven ending, and the ambiguity of whether she’s alive, can you talk about when you had that idea and why you wanted to do that?\n\nRoss Duffer: A couple things: Eleven represents, in a lot of ways, the magic of childhood. And we knew for our kids to be able to grow up, the magic had leave Hawkins. There was never a version that we had written where it was Eleven down in that basement. It was never going to be that simple and that easy. It was finding a way to come up with an ending where it was not that simple, but also bittersweet, and that there was hope there.\n\nMatt Duffer: Speaking of Eleven, Millie keeps Facetiming, disrupting the Zoom.\n\nRight now? Matt Duffer: Yeah. And Millie, if you don’t answer, just keeps hitting you up.\n\n\n\nIt’s two fronts. Ross is talking about it thematically, in terms of the magic of childhood. And then there’s this story element of it in Eleven’s choice, ultimately. It was a huge debate — she’s calling again, I’m so sorry, Kate. I’m curious, actually, what she’s saying. Everybody’s very emotional.\n\n\n\nShe’s like, “I’m alive, guys!” Matt Duffer: “I’m alive, guys,” yeah — no, she’s very emotional. Everybody’s very emotional. And no one’s here in L.A., so we haven’t gotten to see anyone after it played. I’m so sorry. I know what I was gonna say: From a character point of view, not a thematic point of view, we had so many debates in the writers’ room about what we were going to do with Eleven. And then we tried to actually express everything we were talking about in the room on the screen. So Hopper’s speech to Eleven is vocalizing what a lot of people in the room were saying. And then what Kali was saying to her was vocalizing the other side of the argument. The question was, which of those choices is Eleven going to choose? And if you, like Mike and the others, choose to believe that she is alive somewhere, then she picked something in the middle. But either way, it’s a completely selfless act and heroic act on Eleven’s part. I mean, you’ve seen all those pregnant women, and how many children are going to be born, potentially, using her blood, how the cycle will exist, and how many other kids will go through what she went through. And she’s making damn sure that that never happens again.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nOne discussion online this morning is whether Mike made the whole thing up, or Eleven actually told him what her plan was. Or, that during the graduation, Mike realized that Eleven never could have gotten from the truck to the gate because of the kryptonite, so that’s not really her and was a projection. Discuss!\n\nMatt Duffer: The only thing I’ll debunk is that Eleven does not communicate with Mike in any way. But what you just said at the end — yes, at graduation, he’s hearing the speakers distort because the principal is so angry, and it makes him realize that there was the kryptonite. So how could she have possibly made it all the way to the gate? Not only that. How could she have possibly used her powers to bring him into the void?\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBut there are a lot of other questions. Could Kali have actually done that? Could she have possibly been alive? We like that it’s up to the audience. Obviously, we tell you what the characters choose.\n\nAnd when you decided to bring Kali back, was it in your imagination that she could possibly help Eleven with a potential fake-out at the end? And is she alive long enough to do that?\n\nMatt Duffer: Well, that’s the question. We wanted to bring her back for a lot of reasons. We wanted that story to have existed for a reason, and we’ve been looking for a way to bring Kali back and a reason to bring her back. And we found it this year.\n\nBut it wasn’t just for her ability to project or create these illusions. The other part of it was Hopper and Mike are so close to Eleven. Mike is such — I don’t want to call him naive, but a little bit. And he’s such a dreamer and an optimist. I know a lot of people were frustrated with what Kali was saying to Eleven, and I get that. But what she was saying was accurate in so many ways, and we needed someone to be able to voice that — the dark reality of what potentially exists on the other side of that. So those were two of the main reasons we brought her back into the fold.\n\nLet’s assume Eleven is still alive, because that’s more in the spirit of “Stranger Things.” Can she ever reveal herself again to her friends and family?\n\nRoss Duffer: If she were alive, the way I would see it is no. Any contact would risk bringing her back out in the open and starting the cycle again. So, in the story that Mike’s telling, I don’t think he sees a version where they reconnect.\n\nThis is a fandom that I’ve realized over the past month or two does not love ambiguity. How do you feel about the fans who are upset there isn’t more clarity about Eleven?\n\nMatt Duffer: Are a lot of people upset about that? I really don’t know!\n\nI mean, after Volume 2, people didn’t understand that Jonathan and Nancy broke up. I was like, what are you watching?\n\nMatt Duffer: This is obviously intended to be ambiguous, right? With Eleven. At the end of the day, it’s being told from the point of view of Mike and his friends. And they don’t know, and the audience can’t know. If you knew that she was out there and you knew she existed, then she’s very much at risk. So we thought there was something really cool about not knowing for sure, and having our characters choose to believe. We just thought that was more powerful than providing a definitive answer, one way or the other. And I like that the audiences are in Mike, Max, Lucas and Dustin’s shoes, in the sense that they get to choose or not choose. I mean, I’m definitely seeing the majority choosing to believe and side with the kids.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nI side with the kids. Can you talk about the final battle between the Mind Flayer, Vecna and our heroes, and how you specifically wanted to stage that?\n\nRoss Duffer: We were originally going to go to New Mexico to shoot it, and logistically, that became impossible as we moved into the finale. We shot it in some, like, decrepit quarry in Atlanta. But obviously, WETA visual effects, some of the best in the world, did an incredible job.\n\nMainly, what we needed was a huge battlefield for this monster. I don’t think we fully realized quite how large it was until once we built the interior sets. And we were like, “Well, if that’s the size of its interior, how big is its exterior?”\n\nMatt Duffer: We were thinking about D&D, and I was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 at the time, and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons & Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.\n\nEleven obviously is the nuclear option, but Will really helps when she’s on her back foot. When did you figure out that part of it?\n\nMatt Duffer: Well, we knew that Will was obviously going to play a major role in it, and it just came down to, who did we want to deliver the final blow? Was it going to be Will, or was it going to be Eleven? Then we tried to work on a way where it was actually both of them. Eleven throws him into the spike, but Will is the one who allows her to do that. He just breaks him down, rips off his left arm, allowing Eleven that final opportunity. Will was always going to be a key part in defeating Vecna. Without Will, it wouldn’t have happened.\n\nAnd Joyce beheads Vecna. How did you arrive at that moment?\n\nRoss Duffer: In the writers’ room, I remember we went through, “Who gets to do the final blow?” It works with all of them in a way. So, we just cycled through, what if Steve does it? What if Dustin does it? And then finally, when we landed on, what if Joyce does it? It felt right for a lot of reasons. She is sort of the mother of this group, the protector. And also, we never got to see her hit anything with that ax, so that felt like such a satisfying way to deliver the final blow to Vecna.\n\nBut it was in editorial really, where, as we were working on it, that we had the initial flashbacks to her remembering back to Bob, and building up that anger. It felt right that it’s just not just a “fuck yeah” moment. It was also, in a way, a cathartic moment for our characters, who are purging all this trauma that’s been caused here. It’s not just a stand-up and cheer moment. It’s remembering that this evil has caused them so much pain.\n\nMatt Duffer: I remember working with our editor and our composer and just talking to them and going, “Let’s make this the most emotional decapitation in history.” That was the goal.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nShe’s, of course, decapitating the kid whom she cast in “Oklahoma.”\n\nMatt Duffer: Yeah, I guess so!\n\nWas there ever a scene in the 18 months after Season 4 when Hopper and Joyce realized that Henry Creel, aka Vecna, was the kid they went to high school with?\n\nRoss Duffer: Yeah, I’m sure there was. We had a walk a fine line with the play — we don’t want to frustrate, because so much of our audience is unable to see it. To have them start talking about it would have been confusing in the context of someone who hasn’t seen the play. But I’m sure they did have that conversation.\n\nMatt Duffer: We really needed the final season to be exactly as it would have been without the play. The play is Henry’s backstory after he’s infected by the Mind Flayer. But this is how the season was going to play out regardless.\n\nThe Mind Flayer is the real evil, which we asked about in our Volume 1 postmortem. But if you had to define what that rock in the briefcase is, how would you describe it?\n\nMatt Duffer: Hmm. How would we describe it?\n\nWhat is it?!\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: I’m gonna be sketchy here, Kate, because I will say that is — can I say this, Ross? Because it’s just hard to not say it.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nSpinoffy?!\n\nMatt Duffer: Spinoffy, yeah. You pinned us down. So annoying. I do want to explain, just because people’s expectations go in certain directions: The spinoff is going to delve into that and explain that, and you’re going to understand it. But it’s a completely different mythology. So it’s not a deep exploration of the Mind Flayer or anything like that. It’s very fresh and very new, but yes, it will answer some of the loose threads that are remaining.\n\n\n\nWhere are you with the spinoff?\n\nRoss Duffer: We’re going to start working on it again on Monday. We’ve been working on it on and off. We’ll take a few days off.\n\nOn Monday?!\n\nMatt Duffer: You don’t understand. My favorite part of the show is working on it. It’s not releasing it — that’s just stressful, no matter how it goes when you release it. It’s maybe my least favorite part of the process. I like the creative part. I like making it. So, we’re actually really excited, and it’s very exciting to work with a clean slate: completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.\n\nAnd no common characters?\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: Right. Exactly. No common characters.\n\nI wanted to ask you about the review bombing of “The Bridge,” which appears to be a coordinated attack by people who didn’t like Will’s coming out scene. It’s now the lowest rated episode in the series. Can you talk about why it was important to you all along to have Will’s queerness associated with his powers?\n\nRoss Duffer: The coming out scene is something we’ve been building to for nine years now. It was a really important scene for us, and a really important scene for Noah — not just from a thematic point of view, but also a narrative point of view. This show has always been about our characters overcoming evil, and in order to overcome this evil, Vecna, in so many ways, represents all the dark thoughts and the evil of society. And for our characters to overcome that, it really becomes about embracing themselves, and then also embracing one another and coming together.\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: Right. It was the final step in Will’s journey. And Will is, in so many ways, the key to defeating Vecna. Volume 1 is really about self-acceptance, right? I mean, that’s sort of step one. And then step two is Will is talking to Robin — it’s something that he wants to do. He’s trying to figure out how to come out, and he knows that he needs to do that, and that that’s the final step for him. And he finds the courage to be able to do it. And it’s really the ultimate fuck you to Vecna. That was the intention.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nAnd were you prepared for a homophobic campaign like that?\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: No. I mean, no is the honest truth. Because it is, as Ross said, something we’ve been building for a really long time. I always say, Ross and I are many things, but subtle is not one of those things!\n\nRoss Duffer: We’re proud of the episode, and we’re proud of the scene, and proud of Noah, who gave a really brave, very vulnerable performance.\n\nMatt Duffer: I think that’s where Ross and I were most sensitive, was Noah — because of how close to home this hit for him. And our goal was to make sure that he was comfortable and happy with the scene. And when he was, we felt good about it. I’ve been texting with him a lot, but texting with him specifically after that scene and after that episode aired. And he’s in a really good place. He’s very proud of the scene, and we’re proud of the scene.\n\nHe should be, and so should you. I have another question along these lines. There’s a QAnon-ish conspiracy theory going around that Volume 2 was — and I’m doing air quotes, in case you’re not actually looking at me — “tampered with.” That there were scenes that were cut, including El and Mike going into Camazotz to rescue Will, and a Mike and Will one-on-one scene. Have you seen this Google Doc?\n\nMatt Duffer: Someone sent it to us, yeah. Obviously, that’s not a real thing.\n\nHave you seen the Change.org petition with 370,000+ signatures to release the footage?\n\nRoss Duffer: I have not seen that! I don’t think there’s a single cut scene in the entire season.\n\nMatt Duffer: The show has just grown so massive. Online, there’s just so much misinformation. Just tons of it. We would be here for hours trying to bat down the stuff that was not true. But at the end of the day, hopefully the work speaks for itself, and it is the show that Ross and I wanted to make. Netflix was, and has always been, incredible. I mean, there’s no interference or direction at all from them on us. They really trust us, and that’s been true from Season 1 on. It’s never changed, even though the show and the size of the audience have grown.\n\nWe do need to wrap, I know, but I saw you guys were at the Americana last night. Did you actually sit and watch it? And how was it?\n\nRoss Duffer: It was awesome. We never get that experience. I mean, the premieres are one thing, but that’s generally friends and crew. So, to sit there with just true fans — they’re all decked out in merch, and to hear them in real-time responding, whether it’s applauding or laughing or crying. It was an incredible experience.

But those posts are misinformed. It&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Day 2026, [&#8230;]", "content": "You’ve probably seen a variation of this news on social media over the past few days: MTV officially shut down on New Year’s Eve, ending their final broadcast the same way the network started: With the clip “Video Killed the Radio Star” by The Buggles.\n\nBut those posts are misinformed. It’s New Year’s Day 2026, and MTV is still around. Granted, today the channel is playing a marathon of “The Big Bang Theory” sitcom repeats, so your interpretation of “MTV is still around” may vary.\n\nHere’s where the confusion is coming from: On New Year’s Eve, Paramount Skydance did indeed shut down several MTV-branded music channels in the U.K. According to a source, “MTV’s specialist music channels in the UK will no longer operate as linear channels. The flagship MTV UK channel will continue to broadcast… Paramount is reviewing and adjusting its international Pay TV portfolio, given shifts in audience behavior towards streaming and digital platforms.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAs for the U.S., the existing MTV channels will continue to broadcast without change — including MTV and MTV2. MTV hasn’t been “Music Television” for a long time, but the network does still program some digital music channels in the U.S., including “MTV Classic” (playing retro music videos from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s), “MTV Live” (which runs current music videos, as well as other music programming from the Paramount library) and a collection of MTV-branded FAST channels (“MTV Biggest Pop,” “MTV Spankin’ New,” “Yo! MTV” and “MTV Flow Latino”), which play contemporary music videos on Pluto TV.\n\nOf course, fans of MTV’s golden 1980s, 1990s and 2000s era still look nostalgically at when the flagship network really was about music. In those days, MTV’s programming consisted of music videos and music-oriented series like “Headbanger’s Ball,” “120 Minutes” and “Yo! MTV Raps.” Later, “TRL” was an afternoon staple for an entire generation of kids.\n\nBut in recent years, MTV has focused on reality programming — which currently includes “The Challenge” and “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” The network has also been criticized for its over-reliance on series like “Ridiculousness,” which often takes up the lion’s share of its programming. (As Variety wrote in 2020, at one point “Ridiculousness” took up 113 of 168 total hours on MTV — 67.3% of its entire schedule.)\n\nAnd that’s probably why, while inaccurate, this “news” that MTV is shutting down has resonated across social media — especially among Gen Xers and Millennials. They still remember that music on MTV came more than just once a year on the VMAs. And they’ve also seen the recent reports of how cutbacks have eliminated the last vestiges of MTV as we know it: In 2023, the remaining shell of a once-vibrant MTV News division was shut down, and then last year the legacy MTV News website went dark, and its archives were scrubbed from the internet.\n\nThen there was the sense in 2025 that we’ve hit the tipping point when it comes to the decline in basic cable, as companies like NBCU look to shed those once-valuable assets. When Skydance acquired Paramount and started making drastic cuts, its cable networks were hit especially hard: MTV shed most of its remaining comms and talent teams, including top remaining music programming and talent execs. The idea that even a major network like MTV might shut down no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\nAccording to Variety‘s 2025 tally of the most-watched linear networks in primetime, MTV rated No. 49 — with an average of 189,000 viewers. In adults 18-49, MTV ranked No. 25. Compare that to 10 years ago: In 2015, MTV ranked No. 36 with 606,000 viewers.\n\nSo yes, the MTV as we knew it disappeared a long time ago. But MTV as a channel still exists. For now.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 01:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T02:39:50.622585"}

This year, the event was broadcast on a Tuesday.\n\nRoma Daravi, vice president of public relations for the center, said in a statement, “Comparing this year’s broadcast ratings to prior years is a classic apples-to-oranges comparison and evidence of far-left bias.

This post contains details from the series finale of Netflix‘s Stranger Things.\n\nMatt and Ross Duffer have officially closed the book on Stranger Things.\n\nThe supernatural Netflix series rang in 2026 with an epic and emotional two-hour finale that saw the Hawkins crew finally defeat Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) and destroy the Upside Down for good, bringing an end once and for all to the havoc the portal to an alternate dimension has caused for the last four years of their lives.\n\nEleven (Millie Bobby Brown) also vanished with the collapse of the Upside Down, though the Duffers have given both their characters and the audience a powerful coping mechanism to grapple with the grief of her self-sacrifice. Earlier in the finale, it seems that Eleven has broken off from the pack to go back through the gate, ensuring she’ll go down with the wormhole and the government won’t be able to continue its experiments on other children. But, in the final moments of the episode, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) lets his friends in on a little theory he has about their mage, having realized at graduation that El was seemingly able to use her powers and enter the Void to say goodbye to him despite the fact that the military was using that piercing sound (“kryptonite,” as they call it) to debilitate her.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHe relays his hypothesis through the lens of the D&D campaign they’ve just finished playing, which Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Max (Sadie Sink), Will (Noah Schnapp) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) win by using an eleventh hour Hail Mary to summon a mage they’d encountered earlier in their quest. As he’s orating the epilogues for all of their game characters, Mike says he chooses to believe that the mage isn’t actually dead. Instead, with the help of her sister, she was able to escape and start a peaceful life off the grid. As he says it, the episode flashes back to the moment the gate closes in the MAC-Z, and the audience sees Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) use her powers one last time before she dies to make everyone think they see El standing inside the gate so that she can actually slip away and escape for good.\n\nPutting away their D&D books, the kids are an emotional wreck as they realize that the real world is knocking at the door and, in many ways, their lives are irrevocably different than they were just a few short years ago. Both for better and worse. Mike’s final moment of reverie is interrupted as Holly (Nell Fisher) and her friends come storming down the stairs to play their own D&D campaign in the basement, and Mike smiles as he closes the door, literally and figuratively, on that chapter of his life.\n\nIn the interview below, the Duffer brothers discuss crafting what they hope is a satisfying conclusion to the story that launched their careers and the careers of most of the show’s young cast into the stratosphere as well as saying goodbye to the beloved current and former residents of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\nDEADLINE: First of all, how are you both feeling now that the finale is out in the world?\n\nROSS DUFFER: I mean, we definitely feel emotional. I think we’re still processing. We went to see it last night with fans, went to a screening in the Americana [at Brand in Glendale, California], and that was an incredible experience just being, not at a premiere, just being with fans on opening night and seeing them react in real time to what’s happening.\n\n(L to R) Noah Schnapp as Will Byers and Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: You also both watched the finale with a lot of the cast just recently. What was that experience like for you?\n\nROSS: Oh, it was very emotional. I think for everyone, there were a lot of tears at the end, but, also, everyone was just so, so proud and just so supportive of one another. I don’t know. I just felt like everything had come full circle, and just to see how much they’ve grown up over the years… it was really the perfect way to end the whirlwind of press tour and filming and everything. It was quiet, but I thought it was beautiful.\n\nRELATED LINK: ‘Stranger Things 5’ Star Caleb McLaughlin On That Emotional Scene With [SPOILER], Upside Down Mythology & More From Vol. 2\n\nMATT DUFFER: It’s sort of how we feel now. I think everybody was processing it. Everybody was crying. We all went back to my apartment in New York. Some of the cast chose to walk, even though it was 30 minutes, I think because they needed time to process everything. Just having heard from a lot of them yesterday, I haven’t connected with them today, but, I think everyone’s still reeling a little bit. Everybody’s emotional.\n\nDEADLINE: I mean, to be fair, I am feeling emotional about it, and I am only an audience member!\n\nMATT: You have to remember, it’s been 10 years, right? So for the kids, it’s half their lives. I mean, Millie always says she doesn’t remember life or much of it before the show, so I don’t know. I think it was harder for everybody than they thought it was going to be saying farewell.\n\nROSS: So much of the final scenes that you see, I mean, yes, people are acting, but in a way, they’re not. Those are real emotions that they’re feeling, because those are all the last scenes that we captured with these actors. So, it’s a vulnerable thing to see that projected on the big screen and then put out in front of everyone.\n\nMATT: I don’t want to say it’s meta, because it wasn’t, but some of it was a commentary on the experience of the show itself and what it felt like to say goodbye to it. So each of those individual scenes in the epilogue were very personal to all the cast, and I think that’s why each of those days were as emotional as they were. Everybody was crying the entire time.\n\nThe basement scene was two days, so the first day was okay. The first day it was just the fun D&D campaign. Then the second day, everyone was wrecked. I thought they were going to run out of tears, but they did not.\n\nROSS: They did not.\n\nDEADLINE: You can feel a lot of that emotion very viscerally. It doesn’t fully feel like they’re acting in some of those final moments.\n\nMATT: No, that’s not acting. When they’re breaking…when you see Maya [Hawke] break, or any of them break, they were just crying.\n\nDEADLINE: Well, there’s a lot to unpack from the finale, but let’s start there. You said that the basement scene is something you’ve pretty much always envisioned for the finale, but when did this idea of weaving in some ambiguity about Eleven’s death crystallize for you? Why did that feel like the right way to end that story?\n\nMATT: It’s been something on our mind for a really long time. That was the original ending of the show when it was designed as a limited series, that El has to sacrifice herself in some way. I mean, the first thing we did when we were working on Season 5 was to talk about the ending and specifically talk about Eleven and, it was hard.\n\nThis is a character we’ve been with for 10 years. We’ve been with Millie for 10 years. So it was a really hard and emotional decision to make, but at the end of the day, it just felt right to us. It felt like, given the circumstances, it was the only way to actually end, permanently, everything that had been going on, and it’s such a selfless act from her to protect anyone from going through what she went through, if that makes sense.\n\n(L to R) David Harbour as Jim Hopper and Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nROSS: It was always going to end with the kids in the basement. That’s been planned for eight years. Once we figured out this, ‘I believe,’ line from Mike, that’s when everything sort of crystallized. And of course, that was very early on, like week two or three of the writers room this [season]. Once Holly became a bigger figure, sort of the passing of the torch, those were some of the first ideas we had when we were talking about what we wanted this basement scene to be, before we even started writing the season. So it was always headed towards that goal post.\n\nRELATED LINK: Jamie Campbell Bower Unpacks Vecna’s Reign Of Terror In ‘Stranger Things 5’ Vol. 2: “There Are Times Where I Feel Wildly Inhuman”\n\nMATT: At the end of the day, we see it as a big coming of age story. This scene is about one last moment of being kids before they leave that childhood behind. Them going up the stairs is them leaving it, and then Holly and her friends are the new generation who are going to live that out. So, that’s why that last shot of Mike, you see him go from feeling sad about leaving his childhood behind to feeling happy and knowing the happy memories he had with his friends are going to be with him forever.\n\nAnd El, in so many ways to us, represents the magic of childhood, like when you’re growing up, and anything feels possible, and that goes away in some ways as you get older, but it stays with you forever. So the memories of Eleven are always going to be with Mike, and they don’t vanish, right? I mean, she’s going to be a part of Mike and her friends for the rest of time, and they choose to believe she’s still out there, which is powerful.\n\nSo, it’s not saying goodbye. She’s with them forever, and their childhood and the memories of everything they went through, as scary and traumatic as it was at times, as Dustin said, there was so much good that came out of it. Eleven and everything they went through shaped who they are today.\n\nDEADLINE: Did you consider any other deaths?\n\nROSS: In the writers room, I think we talked through everything. You talk through everything, every possibility, and we knew from early on what we wanted to do with Eleven and her fate, and you talk through the other characters, but I think at the end of the day, for us, the show is an adventure story. It’s a coming of age story.\n\nSo for us, it was really talking about those last 30, 40 minutes and where we wanted our characters to be and what we wanted their growth to be and where we wanted to leave them behind. Having those discussions is how we landed on [the idea] that we want our heroes, most of them, to make it out of there.\n\nDEADLINE: I have to say, ‘When Doves Cry’ to ‘Purple Rain’ to ‘Landslide’ is one of the craziest strings of sequential needle drops I’ve ever heard in a show. I need to know how you landed on those songs.\n\nMATT: It was cheap, too, I can tell you. [Laughs]. We spent a long time trying to figure out what was going to be playing on the bomb vinyl. I don’t think we talked more about what song we should use than we did for that particular song, because it was really, really challenging, because the first song needed to be upbeat and hopeful on the vinyl. Then the final song had to work for Eleven’s farewell. So not only are you looking for an iconic song, you need the beginning song and the end song to both work and convey completely different emotions.\n\nWe asked everybody in the cast, all of our friends. Everybody weighed in. Everyone had different ideas. Eventually we landed on ‘Purple Rain,’ but the concern with that was whether or not we were going to be able to get the rights. I mean, aside from Michael Jackson, it’s the hardest thing to do, to get Prince rights. I don’t think we would have got them had it not been for Kate Bush, to be honest. Because of the Kate Bush effect, I think that ultimately persuaded the Prince estate. I don’t know how they feel about the scene, but hopefully they’re happy with it. I guess they approved it, right Ross?\n\nROSS: They did approve it [in the scene]. Then ‘Landslide,’ we love that song, as I think everyone does, and we’ve always wanted to find a place for it. We’re so glad that we finally did. Maya loves that song, and actually, for her final stint as a DJ, we had earplugs, and so she was listening to that song while delivering her last squawk.\n\nDEADLINE: In some ways, Henry gets a redemption in the end, but he isn’t let off the hook. He says he ultimately chose to align himself with the Mind Flayer and is still choosing to do so, and Joyce actually does the honors of killing him. Can you tell me about settling on that ending and why it felt satisfying to you?\n\nROSS: We discussed having a redemption moment for him, as we did with, say, Billy in Season 3, but ultimately, it felt like Henry has gone too far now — and how much of that is him in there versus how much is the Mind Flayer, how much of it is just him unwilling to admit this, we want to leave that a little bit for the audience [to decide].\n\nObviously, Jamie did an incredible job conveying the complexity of emotions here, but ultimately, yeah, he’s gone too far to let go of this, and as a result of all this trauma that he’s caused, that’s why we wanted to give that moment to Joyce. The headshot moment was always in there, but it was in editorial where we ended up putting in these flashbacks as we wanted to make that moment a cathartic moment, as opposed to a stand up and cheer moment.\n\nIt’s a little more complicated than that, in that our heroes have suffered as a result of this evil and as a result of Henry, so even if there was still good inside of him, it’s almost a cleansing of all that evil that he’s done.\n\nMATT: Right. It was kind of f*ck you, and then she chops his head off. We said [in the edit], ‘Well, let’s try a more emotional route and see if we can make this the most emotional decapitation ever.’\n\n(L to R) Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven, Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers, Noah Schnapp as Will Byers, and Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5. Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: It is pretty symbolic, since Joyce has that axe in Season 1.\n\nMATT: Exactly. She had to use that axe.\n\nROSS: We went through every character going, ‘Who gets the final blow on Vecna?’ Then once we landed on Joyce with that axe, us and the writers were like ‘She’s got to be the one.’ It just feels right.\n\nDEADLINE: It’s funny, because in Season 1, I remember thinking ‘What the hell is she going to do with an axe?’\n\nMATT: [Laughs]. Well, she chopped through a wall at Season 1, but it didn’t accomplish anything. She swung at a demo this year, but then she finally put it to real, proper good use.\n\nDEADLINE: How long did it take you to get the finale to 2 hours and 8 minutes? Was there a lot you had to cut?\n\nMATT: Actually, not that long. I don’t remember how long the first draft was. I think it was pretty normal in that they’re usually, like, 10 or 15 pages too fat, and then you just trim it down. We spent so long outlining it that the structure was pretty much intact. Our goal was to keep it around two hours and avoid a two and a half hour ‘Piggyback’ [Season 4, Episode 9]. I mean, two hours is pretty luxurious for a TV episode. We didn’t want there to be any filler in there. So it always landed around two hours. There’s not footage missing.\n\nDEADLINE: You said there’s a hint in the finale about the spinoff you guys are working on. Can you give any hints about what the hint might be?\n\nROSS: I know. We were just talking about this. I don’t know if I want to, but I will say, though, it’s not Hopper mentioning Montauk. There’s no Montauk spinoff. That was more of a wink to the fans, deep-cut fans that know that the show started as Montauk.\n\nIt’s obviously not Holly and the kids or anything like that. It’s something much smaller than that. We’ve said this before, the spinoff idea we have, it is early days, but it is an entirely new mythology. So, it is connected, and it is going to answer some questions that people have, and there’s some lingering questions that weren’t answered in the finale that will be answered in the spinoff. But at the end of the day, it’s got its own story and its own mythology.\n\nDEADLINE: My last question for you is about the end credits. They’re awesome. Can you tell me about creating them?\n\nMATT: I don’t remember where that came in the process. I think, actually, we were editing Season 5. We were in post production when we came up with the idea. We thought about [The Lord of the Rings] Return of the King a lot, just in terms of the length of the epilogue. I always defend the Return of the King epilogue, but I’m one of those hardcore Lord of the Rings fans, to the point where I’ve watched all extended editions in a row on a single day. If you do that, the epilogue feels absolutely perfect and not long at all. In fact, if it felt shorter, it would feel absolutely distressing.\n\nI think, Stranger Things, if you watch Season 5 all the way through, it’s going to feel great. You just want to spend extra time with these characters. Anyway, that was sort of the reference for the epilogue. Then we love the credits at the end of Return of the King. So that was the initial idea, and they were these very simple illustrations.\n\nThen we started to talk with Imaginary Forces, which is the title company that did the main title sequence for the show, who we absolutely love and adore. We pitched that maybe it was Will’s notebook of drawings, and then they came back like a week later and suggested, ‘What if it was done actually in the style of a real D&D manual?’\n\nWhat’s cool about these D&D manuals is there’s color images, and, also, over the years, the style of illustration changes. They brought back illustrators from the actual 1980s who drew in the manuals all the way back then. So it really came full circle, and, mainly, we wanted it to feel finite, right? I mean, that was really the key. We wanted to feel like ‘The End.’\n\nRELATED LINK: ‘Stranger Things’ Shatters Nielsen Record It Already Held As Season 5 Premiere Ushers In Highest Weekly Viewing Total Ever For A Streaming Title\n\nROSS: We wanted to pay tribute, I think, to all of our actors, and even the ones where we can’t list their names contractually, whether it’s Joe Quinn or Shannon Purser, who passed away sadly in the show.\n\nFrom left: Joe Keery, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Maya Hawke, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, Noah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin in ‘ Stranger Things 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nMATT: Well, Shannon didn’t pass away, Ross, let’s be clear.

Flanagan stars as Betty, a proud but emotionally restrained mother struggling with her daughter’s return, while Crowley plays Áine’s father Seamus.\n\n“Having my first scripted film acquired by Disney so early in its life is so wonderful,” said Connaire. “I wanted to tell a story rooted in Irish life but expansive enough to travel. To see that belief reflected in a global acquisition like this is incredibly affirming, and a reminder that small, specific stories can resonate far beyond where they begin.”\n\nProduced by Julie Ryan through her production company MK1 Studios, the film was shot entirely in Connaire’s hometown of Longford, Ireland. Funding was provided by Creative Ireland (Longford), with additional support from Sam and Amelia Dennigan and Anne Heraty, who served as Associate Producers. The film is distributed by Network Ireland.\n\n“From the outset, we felt Brown Bread was a very special film, not because it was trying to be big, but because it was precise, truthful and emotionally brave,” said Ryan. “We were always thinking globally, and Shaunagh has an extraordinary instinct for character and tone that allows stories rooted in place to travel. Seeing a film made in rural Longford now finding a home with Disney reinforces our belief that stories rooted in Irish life can resonate well beyond their place of origin.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:54:55 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T13:37:20.853441"}

At AMC theaters, such concession vouchers cost $20 per seat.\n\nStrangers Things finale played in over 620 locations, and the series creators, the Duffer Brothers, announced two days before the finale played theaters that 1.1 million seats were sold, a number that was ahead of KPop Demon Hunters RSVPs (700M) before it’s late August two-day play. Note, AMC, the no. 1 circuit didn’t play KPop during that run, which yielded exhibitors $19M, and delivered Netflix its first No. 1 ranking title at the weekend box office. You could say that Stranger Things finale is their new No. 1 ranking title at the B.O. (though not on a weekend) — but it’s not box office, it’s concession cash which the movies theaters get to keep, and don’t have co-share ala a regular studio film rental.

Stranger Things finale is something of an olive branch to exhibition, and a means for Netflix to experiment and dip their toes into the theatrical business. Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos has waffled in his messaging on theatrical telling analysts on an earnings call post the success of KPop that Netflix prioritizes their first run movies for the service. Post Netflix firming up its bid for Warner Bros, Sarandos has changed his tune, telling the media, ““There’s been a lot of talk about theatrical distribution, so we want to set the record straight: we are 100% committed to releasing Warner Bros. films in theaters with industry-standard windows.” The town continues to worry what “traditional” means for Netflix.

What caused the postponement of this critically acclaimed drama depicting dueling espionage efforts between Israel and Iran was never specified by the streaming service. But sensitivities regarding the real-life battles that have ravaged the Middle East are suspected of being a factor in the delayed return of “Tehran,” which is co-produced by Israeli public broadcaster Kan 11.\n\nBut that’s far from the only sign of disruption in Israel’s entertainment business these days. And while the struggles currently gripping the country’s film and TV industries aren’t entirely attributable to the pall the Netanyahu administration has cast over just about anything with Israeli or even Jewish connections, it’s an issue to be sure.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe cloud of controversy that has enveloped Israel since Oct. 7, 2023 was a much-discussed topic at this year’s inaugural Jerusalem Sessions event, held last month in the country’s capital city. Conversation touched on a chilling effect being felt in the marketplace of an important industry export: local TV shows into other global territories.\n\nOn the latest episode of the Variety podcast “Strictly Business,” hear from some of the industry pros who came to Jerusalem Sessions from the U.S., Europe and the host country to share their insights.\n\nThe Israeli TV industry has always prided itself for punching far above its weight in its ability to sell shows beyond its borders. First there was success in formats adapted to other languages in other countries, like the HBO series “In Treatment” or Showtime’s “Homeland” and “Your Honor.” More recently, Israel demonstrated its ability to capitalize on the increasingly global market for content opened up by the explosion of streaming services. TV shows like “Fauda” and “Shtisel” that were never intended to play outside of Hebrew-speaking market found second and third lives in other countries in subtitled versions.\n\nBut the Israelis say this business is not as strong as it used to be, Productions with an Israeli provenance are feeling the pain regardless of whether the content is remotely controversial or even pertinent to the war. Plus there are other challenges: the Israeli industry may not have any bigger problem than the one its own government represents. The Israeli broadcaster KAN faces an existential threat of its own under fire from the Netanyahu administration. And the Israeli film world is no less beleaguered, with the government threatening to withdraw crucial funding sources when movies that dare to stray from the party line are recognized.\n\n“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

Based on the average ticket price of €7.45 ($8.75), the box office grossed an estimated $1.17 billion.\n\nWhile the market share of French films rose to 37.7% — which is “unrivaled anywhere else in Europe,” per the CNC — the box office suffered from the absence of a local tentpole and was essentially dominated by Hollywood fare. Disney took the first three slots of the year with “Zootopia 2,” which topped the chart with 6.18 million admissions, followed by “Lilo & Stitch” (5.10 million) and James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire & Ash” (4.58 million). Then came Apple and Plan B’s Brad Pitt racing drama “F1: The Movie” (3.31 million) and Universal’s “Jurassic World: Renaissance” (2.97 million).\n\nThe biggest local hit of 2025, “God Save the Tuche” — the fifth installment in Pathé’s comedy franchise — sold around 3 million tickets and was the only French film which made it in the top 10 (in the sixth spot). Four local films appeared in the top 30, notably Cedric Jimenez’s ambitious sci-fi thriller “Dog 51.” That’s a stark contrast from 2024, when the top three French films in 2024 (“A Little Something Extra,” “The Count of Monte Cristo” and “Beating Hearts”) had garnered 25 million admissions combined.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nInternationally, France was the market that “showed the most severe year-on-year decline in 2025,” Comscore said in its report, noting that markets such as Germany, China and Australia recorded growth. The U.S. and Canada saw a slight increase in box office revenue, while the U.K. ended the year on the same level as in 2024. But the CNC flags that France still hosts Europe’s leading nation of moviegoers. Germany closed the year at roughly 85 million admissions, followed by Italy at 67 million and Spain at 65 million, per the CNC.\n\nThe breadth of local films released throughout the year contributed to the high market share. Several French titles posted solid runs; for instance Ken Scott’s “Once Upon My Mother” crossed 1.4 million admissions, Franck Dubosc’s “Un ours dans le Jura” reached around 1.4 million and Thierry Klifa’s “The Richest Woman in the World” starring Isabelle Huppert sold nearly 900,000 tickets.\n\nAs it often is in France, auteur-driven cinema remained a bright spot, delivering sleeper hits and surpassing expectations. The CNC cited the strong performance of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” Oliver Laxe’s “Sirât,” Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent,” Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Ugo Bienvenu’s “Arco” and Hafsia Herzi’s “The Little Sister.”\n\n“2025 was a mixed year for theatrical cinema, with a declining market due to a lack of unifying films and surprise hits like in 2024, but with a sharp rebound at the end of the year, driven by a strong offering of films, particularly American ones,” said Gaëtan Bruel, president of the CNC. “This result should not obscure the relevance of our model in the long term: a network of theaters with unparalleled density that allows a wide variety of films to reach all audiences, and a market share for domestic films that makes France an exception in Europe and around the world.”\n\nThe year ended on a rebound, powered by a cluster of U.S. pics. Besides “Zootopia 2″ and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried’s erotic thriller “The Housemaid” (released in France by Metropolitan Filmexport) proved to be a late-year hit, released on Dec. 24 and drawing 1.1 million admissions in just a week; as well as Vincent Munier’s wildlife documentary “Le chant des forets” with 360,000 admissions.\n\nBruel is optimistic about the prospects for 2026. Addressing the healthy performance of director-led films, he argued that French audiences are lured by “original and daring offerings.” He added, “From this point of view, 2026 promises to be a very rich year.”\n\nAmong the most promising 2026 releases cited by the National Exhibitors Federation (FNCF) are: Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey,” Steven Spielberg’s “Disclosure Day,” Andrew Stanton’s “Toy Story 5,” Antonin Baudry’s “De Gaulle” and Philippe Lacheau’s “Marsupilami.” There’s also Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part 3,” Ruben Ostlund’s “The Entertainment System is Down,” James Gray’s “Paper Tiger” and Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Digger” in the pipeline.\n\nTop 10 movies at the French box office (in admissions) in 2025:\n\n“Zootopia 2”: 6.18 million\n\n“Lilo & Stitch”: 5.10 million\n\n“Avatar: Fire & Ash”: 4.58 million\n\n“F1: The Movie”: 3.31 million\n\n“Jurassic World: Renaissance”: 2.97 million\n\n“God Save the Tuche”: 2.95 million\n\n“A Minecraft Movie”: 2.66 million\n\n“Mufasa: The Lion King”: 2.64 million\n\n“How To Train Your Dragon”: 2.55 million\n\n“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning”: 2.46 million", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:28:15 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T15:28:47.569259"}

Colbert’s 2025 was defined by CBS canceling “The Late Show.”\n\n“So much has happened in the last year of your life,” Cohen said during the telecast in a nod to Colbert’s cancellation. “I am curious what you left last year having learned… what is the major lesson you learned? It’s not a controversial question.”\n\n“Don’t trust billionaires,” Colbert said and then immediately started laughing. “They don’t get rich by finding that money on the side of the road, brother!”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nColbert announced in July CBS’ decision to pull “The Late Show” off the air. Network executives said the decision was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” but many in the industry figured the decision had more to do with David Ellison’s Paramount takeover. The news hit right as Ellison’s Skydance was acquiring CBS’ parent company Paramount Global. Ellison has been aligning the company more with Donald Trump, who Colbert often bashes on “The Late Show.” In fact, Colbert targeted both CBS and Trump a few days before news of his show’s cancellation when he called out Paramount for paying $16 million to Trump’s estate to settle a lawsuit with Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris.\n\n“As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I’m offended, and I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company,” Colbert said on the show at the time.\n\nDavid Letterman, who created “The Late Show” and hosted the program from 1993 to 2015, was one of many public figures who reasoned Colbert was being canceled due to political reasons involving Ellison taking over Paramount. He called CBS’ decision “pure cowardice” and said Ellison doesn’t “want any trouble along the lines of freedom of the press or free speech or freedom of expression. They don’t want the government going after them, because that concept of freedom of the press and freedom of speech — that’s so old-fashioned.”\n\nIn a GQ cover story published in November, Colbert was asked about his CBS show’s sudden axing shortly after he criticized Paramount‘s $16 million “60 Minutes” settlement with Trump and amid Paramount’s wait for FCC approval for its merger with Skydance. Colbert said it wasn’t unreasonable to think he was canceled for political reasons.\n\n“My reaction as a professional in show business is to go: That is the network’s decision,” Colbert said. “I can understand why people would have that reaction because CBS or the parent corporation — I’m not going to say who made that decision, because I don’t know; no one’s ever going to tell us — decided to cut a check for $16 million to the president of the United States over a lawsuit that their own lawyers, Paramount’s own lawyers, said is completely without merit. And it is self-evident that that is damaging to the reputation of the network, the corporation, and the news division. So it is unclear to me why anyone would do that other than to curry favor with a single individual.”\n\nColbert added: “If people have theories that associate me with that, it’s a reasonable thing to think, because CBS or the corporation clearly did it once. But my side of the street is clean and I have no interest in picking up a broom or adding to refuse on the other side of the street. Not my problem. So people can have their theories. I have my feelings about not doing the show anymore, but you’d have to show me why that’s a fruitful relationship for me to have with my network for the next nine months, for me to engage in that speculation.”\n\n“The Late Show” will sign off the air in May.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:26:13 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:35.622441"}

And this list of 53 is nearly all scripted series, save for major reality events like the 50th season of “Survivor” and the Emmy-winning competition “The Traitors.” Note: This introduction breaks down a tonnage of 2026’s undated highlights by streamer, so if you want to just skip to the list, just click here!\n\nWhereas in past years, it’s become a trend to play hide-the-ball with release dates during the competitive Emmys window in the spring, this year has been different; there’s already a pretty full schedule into March and April. January is as full as we can remember, with returning hits — HBO Max’s Emmy-winning “The Pitt,” Shonda Rhimes’ Netflix smash “Bridgerton” — sure to dominate conversation, with franchise offshoots such as HBO’s “Game of Thrones” spinoff “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” and Paramount+’s “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy.” (Yes, there are also new shows that aren’t based on IP! See below.)\n\nAnd then there are the vast undated masses. For HBO and HBO Max, we know the third seasons of “The Comeback” and “Euphoria” are coming in March and April, respectively, but we don’t know exactly when yet. “Half Man,” Richard Gadd’s follow-up to his Emmys behemoth “Baby Reindeer” (a co-production with the BBC) will be coming during the Emmys window, surely, as will the final season of “Hacks” and the limited series thriller “DTF St. Louis” (starring Jason Bateman, David Harbour and Linda Cardellini). HBO will also have “Rooster” (starring Steve Carell), a new Larry David show, “Lanterns,” “House of the Dragon” returning in the summer — and more.\n\nThe Netflix tsunami will continue, with the returns of the anthology satire “Beef” (starring Carey Mulligan and Oscar Isaac this time), “Ginny & Georgia,” “The Gentlemen,” “The Witcher,” “3 Body Problem,” “The Hunting Wives,” the final season of “Outer Banks” and much, much more. We’ll also be treated to new versions of “Little House on the Prairie” and “Man on Fire,” and classic literary adaptations of “East of Eden” (with Florence Pugh, Christopher Abbott and Mike Faist) and “Pride and Prejudice” (with Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden). Also among the streamer’s 2026 offerings are Dan Levy’s new comedy “Big Mistakes,” the conclusion of the much-loved “Heartstopper” series with “Heartstopper Forever,” the Rachel Weisz-led “Vladimir” and the Jed Mercurio-created thriller “Trinity” (with Gugu Mbatha-Raw and “Bodyguard” star Richard Madden, working with Mercurio again). The Duffer brothers will venture into post-“Stranger Things” content for Netflix with the horror drama “Something Very Bad Is Going to Happen” and “The Boroughs” — and yes, the animated “Stranger Things: Tales From ’85.” Not detailed here, but get ready for it: 4,000 offerings of Netflix reality series, true crime docs and unscripted competition shows like “Clue,” based on the game.\n\nDeep breath after the Netflix paragraph! Apple has announced a lot of its spring programming, but among its un-dated series are another season of “For All Mankind,” the Anya Taylor-Joy-led limited series “Lucky” and (presumably!) “Ted Lasso” Season 4. (And fingers crossed Jessica Chastain’s thriller “The Savant” finally gets on the schedule!) Change is afoot at Paramount+ under David Ellison’s new regime, but soon-to-depart mega-producer Taylor Sheridan will have “The Madison,” “Dutton Ranch” and “Nola King” all heading our way in 2026. Since Showtime exists in name only now, the final seasons of “Yellowjackets” and “The Chi” are now Paramount originals, and will close out their runs there (as will “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds”). “Lioness,” “MobLand,” “Dexter: Resurrection,” “The Agency” and “Colin From Accounts” will return as well.\n\nAs for Amazon, its Prime Video service will debut “Bait” (starring Riz Ahmed, which premieres at Sundance), the highly anticipated live action series “Spider-Noir” led by Nicolas Cage, “Blade Runner 2099,” the “Legally Blonde” prequel “Elle” and “House of Spirits” — you can file those three under IP adaptations we’re fine with, and yes, we’re hypocrites! “Every Year After,” based on Carley Fortune’s romance novel “Every Summer After,” and “Off Campus,” based on Elle Kennedy’s popular book series, are among Prime Video’s other 2026 dramas.\n\n(Almost there, we swear, we’ve just got Peacock, Hulu and FX to go.)\n\nFirst up, Peacock! The streaming home of Bravo’s reality hits and NBC shows (and its library) is coming off the success of Sarah Snook thriller “All Her Fault,” and in 2026, they’ll continue to lean into genre programming. There’s the family drug-running drama “M.I.A.” (from “Ozark” co-creator Bill Dubuque), the long-gestating “Friday the 13th” series “Crystal Lake” (with Linda Cardellini), thriller “The Good Daughter” (Rose Byrne and Meghann Fahy play sisters) and a team of all-stars for the Elin Hilderbrand adaptation “The Five-Star Weekend”: Jennifer Garner, Regina Hall, Chloë Sevigny, Gemma Chan and D’Arcy Carden are the core cast. Peacock is also the destination for a little thing we call the Olympics (the opening ceremony in Milan is on Feb. 6).\n\nOver on Hulu, the Disney-owned streamer will be subsumed into Disney+ at some point this year, but it’s still offering plenty of originals, including the eagerly awaited “The Testaments,” Margaret Atwood’s sequel to “The Handmaid’s Tale” and Mindy Kaling’s new comedy “Not Suitable for Work.” Sure to be highlights also are “Furious,” Elizabeth Meriwether’s retelling of the 1987 Debra Winger movie “Black Widow” (not that Black Widow!) starring Emmy Rossum, and “Phony,” a mystery starring Connie Britton and Sam Nivola. Scripted shows “Only Murders in the Building” and “Rivals,” and reality series “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” and “The Kardashians” are set to return with new seasons.\n\nFor FX, Season 18 of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” Season 2 of “Adults” and Season 5 of “The Bear” will all be on the network this year. And though Ryan Murphy’s “The Beauty” is dated below, his three (3!) other FX shows are not: anthology “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette,” “The Shards” (with Bret Easton Ellis) and lucky Season 13 of “American Horror Story,” with its huge, all-star cast. Limited series “Cry Wolf,” created by Sarah Treem, and starring Olivia Colman and Brie Larson, is on offer this year, as is the untitled “Snowfall” spinoff, which follows the original show’s characters Wanda and Leon.\n\nOK, thank goodness, here’s the list!", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:35.953406"}

However, admissions were down from EntTelligence&#8217;s 2024 figure of 820 million, [&#8230;]", "content": "In a 2025 that generated $8.87 billion at the domestic box office, 780 million people actually went to the movies.\n\nThat’s roughly two visits a year for every person living in the United States; the nation’s population factored at an estimate of 347.3 million.\n\nHowever, admissions were down from EntTelligence’s 2024 figure of 820 million, by -4.9% with the previous 12 months seeing a spike in tickets prices across the board, read general price of admission was $13.29, + 5.7% from 2024, while the price of a premium large format ticket was $17.69, +4.9%.\n\nThe latest figures come from entertainment stat org EntTelligence’s annual report, which also says that moviegoers consumed over 95 billion minutes of features on the big screen in calendar year 2025.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nPre-Pandemic, the industry averaged well over 1B tickets sold annually during the period of 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe annual report also provides some light on attendance in regards to windows and that’s that 35.6% of all moviegoers went to see movies in the first 3 days of release. Compare that to 73.2% of all attendees watched movies in their first 14 days of release, while 90.7% of all moviegoers headed to cinemas during pics’ first 30 days of release.\n\nDisney led all motion picture studios (of course) in admissions repping close to 26% of the 780M or 202.9M; the studio’s domestic figure at $2.49 billion. Warner Bros repped 20.15% of admissions or 157.1M after $1.9 billion at the North American B.O. Universal films attendance was 17.96% (140M, $1.78B), Sony’s 6.4% (49.9M, $610.5M), Paramount’s 6.4% (49.9M, $554M), Lionsgate’s 3.9% (30.4M, $331M) and A24’s 2.77% (21.6M admissions). Disney’s admissions figure doesn’t include Searchlight, Sony’s doesn’t include Sony Classics, and Uni’s doesn’t count Focus Features in the EntTelligence calculation.\n\nAmong genres, most people attended action movies at 39.2% which actually had the highest average ticket at $13.88 over horror ($13.07, 11.56% attendance), drama ($12.85, 10.3% attendance), animation ($12.67; 14.4% attendance) and comedy ($12.50, 5.6% attendance).\n\nPG family films were very popular and pulled in the lions share of admissions at 34.4%, followed by PG-13 with 31.5% and R-rated movies at 28.3%.\n\nAmong cities, Los Angeles had the most foot traffic at 8.97%, followed by New York with 6.48%, Dallas at 3.69%, Chicago at 3.28% and Houston with 3.13%.\n\nBlue voting zones pulled in more moviegoers than red, 56.5% to 34.6%, and that’s because most movie theaters are located in Democrat leaning zip codes (as of the 2024 presidential election).\n\nIn demos, males and females were roughly even in admissions, 50.15% to 49.85%. Kids under 13 repped 10.76% of attendance while those over 60 years old repped 11.1% of attendance.\n\nPer industry sources, the hope is that the domestic box office gets to $9 billion in 2026. The last time the box office hit that threshold post Covid was 2023, the year of Barbie and Oppenheimer.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:27:40 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:33:37.640254"}

And now there’s also “Damp January,” which can mean whatever you want it to but often involves cutting down to weekend-only drinking or trying lower-proof alternatives. Another new approach to alcohol consumption is “zebra-ing” — following an alcoholic drink with a non-alchoholic beverage to keep consumption moderate.\n\nCelebrity entrepreneurs are diving into the non-alcoholic market with an array of new options. This year more guys are entering the chat: Tom Holland founded BERO based on his own Dry January experience, while a sober John Mulaney helped co-found Years Beer.\n\nKaty Perry’s De Soi, a line of sparkling ready-to-drink non-alcoholic apéritifs with natural adaptogens, has NA alternatives for dozens of cocktails such as Moscow Mules and Spicy Margaritas.

Even if the show were scheduled to go on, he said, he would decline to attend on principle.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Last year, way before the change of Board and name of the Kennedy Center, I was invited by (director) Francesca Zambello to be part of a Washington National Opera event on May 16, 2026,” Schwartz said in the email sent to Newsday. “But I’ve heard nothing about it since February 2025, so I have assumed it’s no longer happening. I can’t imagine Francesca continuing under the current circumstances. If it is happening, of course I will not be part of it.”\n\nSchwartz joins a growing list of artists and performers who have pulled out of appearances scheduled for the venue, including a recent torrent who pulled out after the largely Trump-installed board voted to add the current president’s name atop John F. Kennedy’s, with no legal basis for renaming a national monument.\n\nThe pullout by Schwartz has symbolic value: He was the co-writer of the program that opened the Kennedy Center back in 1971, “Mass,” a collaboration with Leonard Bernstein.\n\nSchwartz was one of very few big-name figures left who had a performance scheduled at the Kennedy Center in 2026. Variety scanned the list of events on the ticketing page for the venue, and Renee Fleming and Tyrese are among the only celebrities on the docket. Otherwise, the programming at this point is mostly devoted to orchestral attractions and other institutional fare, along with children’s programming, a recurring comedy show and touring musicals. A handful of jazz and Americana performances by individual artists dot the schedule, mostly by artists without a large national profile.\n\nAmong the most recent cancellations listed is a set of performances by the Asian comedy troupe “Asian AF,” listed as “canceled” on the Kennedy Center site although the shows still appear on the comedy group’s own website.\n\nThe Schwartz featured appearance still listed on the center’s website for May is a gala under the aegis of the Washington National Opera. “Witness the links between musical theater and opera come alive in this thrilling concert!” the promotional copy promises. “Acclaimed musical theater lyricist and composer Stephen Schwartz curates and hosts for one night only, bringing together an exciting lineup of soloists to perform beloved repertory.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:50:15 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:59:07.377023"}

Local police told the BBC in a statement that Joshua has been taken to the hospital and his injuries are minor.\n\nThe officials said Joshua is doing “fine.” Graphic and unverified videos of the crash and its aftermath were posted across social media sites this morning.

The fighter is coming fresh off his exhibition bout with YouTuber Jake Paul.\n\nJoshua defeated Paul via knockout in the sixth round. Paul was hospitalized after suffering a broken jaw. The fight, organized by Paul’s Most Valuable Promotions, is the former YouTuber’s second live event on Netflix following his bout with Mike Tyson. Paul had been scheduled to fight Gervonta Davis next. But that fight was canceled when the latter became embroiled in a civil lawsuit where he was accused of battery, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, and intentional infliction of emotional distress by ex-girlfriend Courtney Rossel.\n\nNetflix reported that the Paul and Joshua fight attracted 10.9M views. That put it in third place for the week. The figure is substantially lower than the audience for Paul’s Mike Tyson matchup. That fight racked up 46.6M views. The Tyson and Paul fight was No. 1 in 78 countries and in the Top 10 in all 91 countries that Netflix tracks.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:56:16 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:59:08.953425"}

That is referenced in the teaser.\n\n“It’s the return of The Muppet Show back on the very stage where it all started, and then ended, and is maybe starting again, depending on how the night goes,” Kermit says in it.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe Muppet Show special features Kermit, Miss Piggy and the beloved Muppet gang for a blend of music and comedy — and a whole lot of chaos — as they once again take the stage of the original Muppet Theatre with Sabrina Carpenter as their special guest.\n\nCarpenter, who has spoken of her love for the Muppets for years and channeled Miss Piggy with her outfit at the VMAs in September, is sharing a scene — and a dance — with the Muppet icon in the teaser, which you can watch above.\n\nMeanwhile, Rogen gets a reality check from Fonzie.\n\n“It’s always been a dream of mine to be here,” Rogen says, to which the bear replies, “Got any other dreams?”\n\nFrom 20th Television, Disney Branded Television, The Muppets Studio and Point Grey Pictures, the special is directed by Alex Timbers, who also serves as executive producer. Rogen, Goldberg, James Weaver and Alex McAtee are executive producers for Point Grey Pictures; David Lightbody, Leigh Slaughter and Michael Steinbach are executive producers for The Muppets Studio; Carpenter, Albertina Rizzo, Matt Vogel and Eric Jacobson are executive producers.\n\nVeteran Muppet performers Bill Barretta, Dave Goelz, Eric Jacobson, Peter Linz, David Rudman and Matt Vogel perform the majority of the iconic Muppet characters in the special, joined by a team of additional performers. Dave Goelz, who has performed with The Muppets for over 50 years, was one of the performers on the original The Muppet Show and originated the characters Gonzo and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, among many others.\n\nThe Muppet Show, created by Jim Henson, ran from 1976-81 and aired in over 100 countries and featured notable guest stars including Elton John, Johnny Cash, Diana Ross, Debbie Harry, Gladys Knight, Liza Minelli, Paul Simon and many others. All five seasons are currently available to stream on Disney+", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:43:37 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T16:59:09.482727"}

At the start of the year, news of Clooney’s French citizenship sparked criticism from Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior deputy to the interior minister, who argued in a radio interview on Franceinfo that it raised ”issue of fairness.”\n\nVedrenne suggested that Clooney had been granted French citizenship out of favor due to his fame rather than on merit, and she argued “this is not the right message to send.” She also said she felt that it showed some ”double standards” and added that she will verify “the entire procedure,” according to Le Monde newspaper. But shortly after Vedrenne’s comments, the interior minister Laurent Nuñez fought back the accusations of Vedrenne – with whom he works closely — saying that Clooney and his wife Amal were naturalized “by decree,” from a “decision of the public authority.” Nunez also said Clooney’s naturalization was “a great chance for our country.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe ministry of foreign affairs also reacted to the bashing over Clooney, arguing that the government “followed a rigorous procedure ranging from security checks to regulatory naturalization interviews at the prefecture, including the payment of tax stamps.”\n\n“Like many French people, we are delighted to welcome George and Amal Clooney to the national community,” said the ministry, who cited the civic code which allows “any foreigner (…) who contributes through their distinguished actions to the influence of France and the prosperity of its international economic relations” to gain access to French citizenship.\n\nClooney, who lives in the South of France, in Brignoles, with his Amal and their twins, Ella and Alexander, recently joked, while promoting Netflix’s “Jay Kelly” on the local pay TV channel Canal+, that his French was “horrible.” He said his wife and kids, meanwhile, spoke French fluently. “They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face, and I don’t know,” he said. Clooney previously told the French radio RTL in an interview in December, “I love the French culture, your language, even if I’m still bad at it after 400 days of courses.”\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, took the opportunity to mock Clooney. “Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.\n\nClooney recently starred as a cameo in the “Call My Agent!” movie spinoff which is produced by Mediawan for Netflix.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:14:09 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T17:28:23.109675"}

The same goes for Chloé [&#8230;]", "content": "“Coyote vs. Acme”\n\nLooking back, Dave Green recognizes the irony: “I think I was in self-protection mode after the previous experience I’d had [directing “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows”], and I was just wanting to be very careful about who I was going to work with next,” he says, describing the excitement he felt pitching Warner Bros. his take on Ian Frazier’s satirical “Coyote v. Acme” piece, first published in The New Yorker, in which Wile E. Coyote sues the company that manufactured all his faulty equipment.\n\n“Pretty much all of the Looney Tunes movies that had ever been made are ensemble movies,” he says. “They are ‘The Avengers,’ basically. But I felt like they’d never made the ‘Iron Man’ of the Looney Tunes movies, and I felt like there was an opportunity there to get to know one character in a really intimate way. And then from there, we can cameo and showcase the other characters.”\n\nSamy Burch wrote the script, and Green worked out an elaborate previs presentation, in which hand-drawn characters appeared alongside flesh-and-blood actors (Will Forte would later be cast as the shaggy lawyer representing Coyote), so execs could picture the film Green had in mind. The studio loved the idea, partnering him with producer Chris DeFaria, who had live action/animation hybrid experience from “Tom & Jerry.”\n\nMaking the film was a blast, insists Green, whose creative blending of beloved characters (including deep cuts for super-fans) with live-action footage recalls “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.” The sense of humor is similarly anarchic: “I felt like that edginess was always a defining element of the Warner Bros. cartoons over Disney stuff,” Green says.\n\nThen, just when the film was finished, the studio bean counters decided to bury the project, choosing to take a tax write-off instead — a tough break for Green, who had bypassed film school, working as an assistant for Sam Raimi on “Spider-Man 3” after getting his American Studies degree at UC Berkeley.\n\nHis Amblin-esque 2014 debut, “Earth to Echo,” explored the bond between three boys and a hovering, mostly-computer-generated droid. Then came the “TMNT” sequel, a crash course in motion capture for a young filmmaker hungry for such challenges. “Coyote vs. Acme” was supposed to be the solution to the compromises made on that film. Fortunately, Warner Bros. sold the rights to Ketchup Entertainment, which will release the film in August. Meanwhile, Green is being careful about his next project.\n\n“I’m always looking to do something I haven’t done before, and getting to stretch into new areas,” says Green, who’s developing an R-rated high school party movie called “Hex” that has a supernatural element to it. “Everything I’m chasing these days is darker, allowing me to step outside the family space.”\n\n— Peter Debruge\n\nInfluences: Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, the Coen brothers, Sam Raimi\n\nAgency: UTA\n\nManagement: Kaplan/Perrone\n\nLegal: Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof + Fishman", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:05:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T17:28:23.346932"}

It will also be about watching actors attempt to stretch, surprise and sometimes completely reinvent themselves in front of our eyes.\n\nVariety‘s annual slate of the most anticipated film performances is defined by momentum and ambition. Legacy stars are stepping back into the arena with something to prove, while a new generation edges closer to that elusive line between “promising” and “arrived.”\n\nWe have icons like Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington returning to familiar archetypes with the weight of history behind them. Elsewhere, performers like Charles Melton and Sadie Sink are chasing the kind of work that reshapes careers rather than simply advances them. Comedians are turning toward drama (Hannah Einbinder). Dramatic actors are flexing comic instincts (Penélope Cruz). And a handful of performers appear determined to make 2026 the year the industry finally catches up to what they’ve been doing all along.\n\nWhat makes this year especially dynamic is the sheer range of tones and filmmakers in play. Alejandro G. Iñárritu is pushing Tom Cruise into darkly comic, existential territory. Werner Herzog is orchestrating something gloriously strange with Kate and Rooney Mara at its center. Christopher Nolan is mounting a mythic adaptation of “The Odyssey,” positioning Matt Damon as cinema’s ultimate wanderer. Elsewhere, Boots Riley skewers capitalism through satire, Steven Spielberg returns to alien awe with a sense of menace, and the long-awaited “Peaky Blinders” film looms as either a victory lap or a funeral march for one of television’s most indelible characters.\n\nThese performances aren’t ranked by their award probability, though we expect many will land in that conversation. They’re selected for the choices behind them. Some actors are testing whether they can carry a franchise. Others are trying to prove they’re more than one. A few are simply reminding audiences why their presence on screen still matters as much as ever.\n\nWhether it’s Christian Bale’s latest interpretation of Frankenstein’s creature with a punk-rock edge or KJ Apa attempting the near-impossible task of embodying the legendary Jimmy Stewart, these are the 65 performances we can’t wait to see, and the ones most likely to dominate conversations long after the credits roll.\n\nNote: The list is limited to one performer per film, with actors appearing only once, regardless of multiple projects.\n\nHonorable mentions: Amy Adams (“Klara and the Sun”); Ben Ahlers (“Little Brother”); Javier Bardem (“The Beloved”); Jessica Chastain (“Other Mommy”); Michael Fassbender (“Hope”); Will Ferrell (“Judgment Day”); Ralph Fiennes (“28: Years Later: The Bone Temple”); Jake Gyllenhaal (“In the Grey”); Nicholas Hoult (“How to Rob a Bank”); Caleb Landry Jones (“Dracula: A Love Tale”); Thomasin McKenzie (“The Uprising”); Rosamund Pike (“Wife and Dog”); Julia Roberts (“Panic Carefully”); Ryan Reynolds (“Mayday”); Meg Ryan (“Good Sex”); Cory Michael Smith (“October”); John Turturro (“The Only Living Pickpocket in New York”); Jeremy Allen White (“The Mandalorian and Grogu”)", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T17:28:23.654788"}

But the 53-year-old Pentecostal preacher has also raised eyebrows on the show with her church’s unconventional practices, and her controversial marriage to her step-grandfather. TLC says the new series “unpacks the allegations behind the headlines and reveals the darker and more unsettling truth.”\n\n“The Cult of the Real Housewife” features archival footage of sermons delivered by Cosby and husband Robert Cosby Sr., along with new interviews with longtime church members, Cosby’s sister and her cousin. The docuseries also promises to “elevate the voices of ex-congregants speaking out for the first time,” while also featuring a “leading cult expert who can offer insight around a playbook designed to enforce loyalty in mind-control cults.”\n\nThe topic of whether or not Cosby was a cult leader was briefly brought up by cast members in earlier seasons of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” but the TV star sidestepped any allegations on the reality show and is seemingly friendly with the cast. An episode of the current season of “RHOSLC” even found the women attending a worship service at Cosby’s Faith Temple Pentecostal Church.\n\nPer a press release, the new unauthorized Cosby docuseries, “Traces the dramatic rise of Faith Temple from its founding by the beloved Rosemary ‘Mama’ Cosby, grandmother of Mary Cosby, to her passing, the controversial transfer of leadership, and her husband’s marriage to Mary.

Of course, only a select few will continue on to Oscar glory — 20 to be exact. But there are many notable performances that, while well-received, have yet to be recognized by top awards associations. Here, we make a case for 12 actors who deserve consideration.\n\n\n\nWill Arnett\n\nIs This Thing On?\n\nArnett gets to flex his dramatic muscles in Bradley Cooper’s comedy-drama. As his marriage to Tess (Laura Dern) crumbles, Alex (Arnett) finds a creative and psychological outlet in stand-up comedy. While we expect Arnett to nail the comedy bits, he’s loving, confused, hurt and defiant in a scene with Dern in his bachelor pad. He has an old photo of Tess in her heyday on the volleyball court blown up and framed, but the angle is from behind. He says it shows their sons what a badass their mom is; she explodes because it doesn’t show her face. The scene encapsulates all the issues in their marriage and both play it with heartbreaking poignancy.\n\n\n\nMiles Caton\n\nSinners\n\nDirector Ryan Coogler describes Caton as an “once-in-a-lifetime voice,” and he’s not wrong. It’s certainly impressive when Caton, who plays the preacher’s son, Sammie, in “Sinners,” teases his vocals in the back of a car ride, but when he steps on stage for a big musical number, his singing blows the roof off the joint. Literally! It’s a memorable and captivating debut performance with Caton showing off his singing and acting chops.\n\n\n\nOona Chaplin\n\nAvatar: Fire and Ash\n\n“Game of Thrones” alum Oona Chaplin is Pandora’s newest villain, Varang, the main antagonist leading the Ash people in James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Chaplin’s Varang is fiery and thrilling to watch. She’s a highlight of the film — certainly with her powerful physicality, flashing eyes and stunning headdress, it’s hard to take your eyes off her. Varang is terrifying, but her drive to save her people makes her a hero. And maybe, Varang isn’t the bad guy after all. Hopefully, the next installment gives Varang and Chaplin more time to shine and help understand her origin story.\n\n\n\nKerry Condon\n\nTrain Dreams\n\nLike Heath Ledger’s closed-off cowboy in “Brokeback Mountain,” Joel Edgerton’s taciturn Robert Grainier in “Train Dreams” struggles to put his feelings into words, retreating into himself after his wife dies. When Condon enters the picture, playing a widow who comes along at a moment when the wounded logger appears to have lost his purpose, she brings grace and warmth to the equation. Even just sitting quietly at his side, the Irish actress conveys the healing power of human connection in several quietly profound scenes that course-correct his attitudes on life.\n\n\n\nBilly Crudup\n\nJay Kelly\n\nWhile his co-star Adam Sandler is rightfully being recognized for his standout supporting role in the film, Crudup also delivers a master class in just a few minutes of screen time. Crudup plays Timothy, a counterpart of George Clooney’s titular movie star who never made it as an actor and sees his old friend as having taken the glory he deserved. As the two catch up, Crudup veers from good-natured to sorrowful to bitter to menacing in a matter of minutes. It’s no coincidence that even when he’s offscreen, his character haunts the rest of the story.\n\n\n\nAbel Ferrara\n\nMarty Supreme\n\nThe “Bad Lieutenant” helmer gives his Ezra Mishkin an unexpected arc: he at first seems like a doddering old man down on his luck who’s overly attached to his dog. But by the time events with Timothée Chalamet’s Marty come to a head, Ferrara has drawn a sinister character — a gangster with a hair-trigger finger on his gun who will kill to get back his dog and money, in that order. While Ferrara’s gangster is chilling, a climactic shootout in a farmhouse allows him to play Mishkin as the lead in the blackest of comedies.\n\n\n\nJacobi Jupe\n\nHamnet\n\nJupe might not be eligible for a SAG ensemble nomination due to technicalities, but he won over audiences in Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” as the titular character. He plays the young son of William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) and wife Agnes (Jessie Buckley). In the film, his dad has to travel to London for work and tells his son to “be brave.” Hamnet takes those words to heart and sacrifices his life for his sister’s. Jupe delivers one of the best child performances of the year. He’s charming as a young boy who aspires to follow in his dad’s footsteps, and act. But he pulls out all the stops for the death scene and breaks your heart as he promises to be brave and face death.\n\n\n\nLucy Liu\n\nRosemead\n\nLiu has always been a scene-stealer, be it the slapstick comedy of “Ally McBeal” or in action pics like “Kill Bill.” What’s particularly impressive about her work in “Rosemead” is how immediately you buy her as the grounded character of Irene, a Chinese immigrant. When she learns her cancer is terminal and her schizophrenic son will soon be legal age, she is driven to a desperate choice that might seem unthinkable. But in Liu’s hands, you never doubt Irene’s love and you can empathize with her impossible plight. It’s a timely, urgent film made all the more harrowing knowing it’s based on a true story.\n\n\n\nJay Lycurgo\n\nSteve\n\nAs ensemble acting goes, Netflix’s “Steve” is a knockout, collecting roughly a dozen unfamiliar young performers to play rowdy reform-school cases opposite Cillian Murphy’s unravelling headmaster. The novel that inspired “Steve” was actually named for Lycurgo’s character, Shy, who can turn from tender and introspective one moment to frighteningly aggressive on a dime. Lycurgo did earn a British Independent Film Award for his remarkable, unpredictable performance, but the young actor deserves further accolades. He succeeds in keeping audiences on edge, while also generating empathy for his troubled character.\n\n\n\nVahid Mobasseri\n\nIt Was Just an Accident\n\nIranian actor Mobasseri starred in helmer Jafar Panahi in 2022’s “No Bears,” and here, the revered director casts him as a mechanic whose determination to extract retribution on his jailer is at once chilling, stomach-churning and even funny. Mobasseri plays Vahid as a relatable everyman that the audience latches onto — he is our surrogate. But Mobasseri infuses Vahid with decency that overcomes a thirst for revenge, and in the end, his fear is a startling reminder to not yield to oppression.\n\n\n\nSarah Niles\n\nF1\n\nNiles, as Bernadette, the mother of driving phenom Joshua (Damson Idris), brings charm, savvy and most importantly, a large well of confidence and love for her son to “F1.” It’s not so much one moment with her character, it’s the way her spirit threads through the film: she believes in her son’s talent more than he believes in it.

Transparency feels like a way of honoring a film about paranoia, gaslighting, lies and manipulation.\n\nOn first watch, my sympathy ping-ponged between Jesse Plemons’ Teddy and Emma’s Michelle. He’s a greasy, probably very unwell conspiracy theorist who has kidnapped a cold and robotic girlboss (my favorite little detail is her putting her trench coat on her shoulders to walk out of her mansion, taking three steps to her car and taking it off). Seeing her calmly listening to his deranged nonsense about how she must make contact with her ship made me sympathize with her even though I’m prone to dislike a calculating pharmaceutical CEO. She is after all, his victim. Her cruelty is revealed later though, followed by a series of violent and desperate escalations from both. Yorgos deliberately keeps his audience in the dark for much of the film and in doing so colors the film with his characters’ uneasy paranoia.\n\nIt’s in the dizzying, meticulous sparring between the protagonists — each working relentlessly to assert their version of the truth — that the heart of the movie lies. Yorgos’ emphasis and restraint in these scenes make us feel like another person in the room trying to make sense of things, going mad in the process. That unnerving synthesizer score which follows the characters takes this sense of immersion even further. The result feels like scrolling online reading vastly different takes on the same issues. At a certain point, one begins to question … is he right? Could she be an alien?\n\nI thought of all the times that I have been made out to feel like a conspiracy theorist for asking questions like “What else does this media company own?” “Why does my school invest in weapon manufacturers?” “Why is this vaccine no longer recommended?” “What would it mean if this company buys this streamer?”\n\nWe have entered an era of necessary skepticism, easily dismissed as paranoia by a ruling class who have positioned themselves as the voice of reason. After all, the skeptics carry cardboard signs while “reasonable” people wear suits. Michelle calmly tells her kidnapper that he’s in an “echo chamber,” saying it almost like she’s trying to help him out of it. This reminded me of politicians saying that young people are getting all confused observing wars via TikTok, that they’re consuming propaganda. Never mind that special interest groups bankroll the career of these politicians in exchange for these opinions. Who’s the propagandist?\n\nI find it impossible to meaningfully praise this film in a vacuum; it is because we as an audience are often manipulated and lied to by forces more powerful than us that this movie resonates and is being so talked about.\n\nTruth is often kept from Yorgos’ protagonists, and getting to the bottom of it rarely ever yields happiness. They’re also almost always very lonely. Teddy proudly states that he’s doing everything on his own, that he’s not part of any movement. Skepticism is isolating, especially when you’re told you’re crazy by those whose agendas clash with the truth. But movies like these can make us feel less lonely.\n\n“We are not alone,” reads a tabloid article about aliens that Teddy has in his kitchen. I choose that as my takeaway here. Maybe we feel hopeless, maybe corporations and politicians can toy with our fates while making us feel crazy for pointing that out. But we are not alone!\n\nJulio Torres is an author, comedian, actor, writer, director and producer.

Written and directed by Ira Sachs, the film is a mesmerizing time warp into the heart of New York’s queer cultural history.\n\nStarring Ben Whishaw as the pioneering photographer Peter Hujar and Rebecca Hall as the writer Linda Rosenkrantz, the movie is based on a rediscovered 1974 interview transcript. In this unique narrative experiment, Rosenkrantz asks Hujar to narrate the events of the previous day in minute, exhaustive detail, resulting in a film that illustrates the life of the creative mind through both the quotidian and the imaginative.\n\nJanus and Sideshow acquired the film after its Sundance premiere and released it in early November. It has since scored five Independent Spirit Awards nominations including Best Feature and Best Director for Sachs. The screenplay was also nominated for a USC Scripter Award.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe narrative follows Hujar as he chronicles his waking hours from December 18, 1974, recounting everything from the moment he woke up until he went to sleep. This account is far from a dry recitation; it is filled with Hujar’s observations, honest self-assessments, and amusing dollops of gossip involving a wide circle of 1970s cultural luminaries. The film captures Hujar’s interactions and thoughts on figures such as Allen Ginsberg, Susan Sontag and Lauren Hutton, bringing the creative ferment and dodgy conditions of the era’s Lower East Side scene to life.\n\nSachs envisioned the project as an art project first and foremost, focusing on an intimate relationship between the camera and its subjects. Shot on 16mm film with a 4:3 aspect ratio, the production intentionally avoids a glossy, commercial look in favor of naturalistic, sometimes underexposed lighting that emphasizes simple elegance. This stylistic choice underscores a central theme of the film: the radical honesty of artists who produced work because they had to, rather than for commercial gain or bourgeois expectations.\n\nUltimately, Peter Hujar’s Day explores the preciousness of life’s fleeting, everyday moments and the perpetual struggle of art to capture them. The dialogue-driven film treats the small details of Hujar’s day — what he ate, where he traveled, and what his friends wore — as monumental events.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 19:11:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T19:21:40.222254"}

I just didn’t think it was that good, the show,” Chase told The Times about the series.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhen asked how he felt about his role ending, Chase answered: “I thought it ended great.”\n\n“It was too great a misunderstanding of what I was saying and not saying,” Chase then added about his exit. “I thought that there was at least one person — and another who, for some ungodly reason, didn’t get me, didn’t know who I was, or didn’t realize for one second I’m not racist. They were too young to be aware of my work. Instead, there was some sort of visceral reaction from them.”\n\nAs recounted in the documentary and by The Times: “During production of Season 4, Chase became frustrated with his character’s increasing bigotry, in particular with a story line in which the character does a bit with a blackface hand puppet. The documentary recounts allegations that Chase, in frustration, asked whether his character would next be made to use a racial slur, and reportedly uttered that slur in reference. He abruptly exited the show.”\n\n“Community” director Jay Chandrasekhar is interviewed in the documentary and says Chase had a “meltdown” on set after an incident in which he allegedly used the N-word on set leaked to the press. The alleged incident occurred between Chase and co-star Yvette Nicole Brown, with Chandrasekhar explaining: “I know that there was a history between [Chevy and Yvette] around race, and she got up and stormed out of there. Chevy storms off, so the producer is like, ‘We need Yvette in the scene, right?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, she’s in the next scene.’ And he goes, ‘Well, she won’t come out unless Chevy apologizes to her.’”\n\nChandrasekhar said Chevy eventually returned to the set but claimed he “didn’t say anything” to upset Brown, adding: “[Chevy] goes, ‘You know, me and Richard Pryor, I used to call Richard Pryor the N-word, and he used to call me The Honky, and we loved each other.’ And I’m like, ‘I know, man, I love that bit.’ I said, ‘You know, can we just have a little apology?’ He goes, ‘For what?’”\n\nThe incident was later reported on by The Hollywood Reporter, who claimed Chase was “frustrated” with his character arc and used the N-word “when questioning the dialogue.” The report stressed that Chase did not use the racial slur directly at his Black co-stars Brown and Donald Glover, although both actors were reportedly on set at the time.\n\nChandrasekhar said that when production resumed after the THR story broke, Chase arrived on set and had a “full meltdown” as he came “storming onto the set, and he goes, ‘Who fucked me over?’ … My career is ruined! I’m ruined!’ Like, it’s a full meltdown. ‘Fuck all of you!’ And I’m like, ‘Alright, let’s shoot the scene.’ He never ended up coming back after that.”\n\nZenovich previously told Variety that she tried to get more of Chase’s “Community” cast members and crew members to participate in the documentary but “every single person said no” because “there are things people don’t want to talk about.”\n\nAs the “Community” incident resurfaced due to “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” Yvette Nicole Brown took to Instagram and appeared to address it by writing: “There are things I’ve never spoken of publicly and perhaps never will. Anyone currently speaking FOR or ABOUT me with perceived authority is speaking without EVER speaking to me about the things they claim to know about. They actually don’t really know me at all.”\n\nDonald Glover notably told The New Yorker in 2018 that Chase repeatedly made racist jokes on the “Community” set. Chase, meanwhile, told CBS Sunday Morning in 2022 that he “doesn’t give a crap” about headlines and former co-stars painting him as problematic on set, adding at the time: “I don’t give a crap. I am who I am. And I like who I am. I don’t care. And it’s part of me that I don’t care. And I’ve thought about that a lot. And I don’t know what to tell you, man.

He’s really just trying to do his best. He’s good-natured. He’s loving. He sees the best in everyone.”\n\nThat idea was Superman is not a god, but a sincere, sometimes awkward moral presence. That became Gunn’s anchor — and he credits Grant Morrison’s “All-Star Superman” for crystallizing that approach. “That was the thing that hooked me,” he shares. “That big lug of a superhero being genuinely kind. That’s what I took from the book.”\n\nUnlike the relative freedom Gunn had with “Guardians of the Galaxy,” Superman came with a century’s worth of expectations, and of course, disagreements. “Everyone in the world thinks something different about Superman. Everybody knows who he is.”\n\nThe scrutiny extended beyond the cape. Gunn was aware that this film would be viewed as a referendum on the future of DC itself. “There were all the eyes on us — on DC, on the DCU, on everything,” he says. “That pressure was real.”\n\nCasting, then, was non-negotiable. “If I couldn’t find Superman, I wasn’t going to make the movie,” Gunn says flatly. David Corenswet was the second audition he saw. “I remember thinking, ‘If that’s the worst we do, we’re in great shape.’”\n\nWhat emerged is a film that leans toward optimism at a moment when superhero cinema has often favored grit. Gunn’s Superman isn’t naïve, but he is hopeful. Coming off the year we all had, that choice feels quite radical.\n\nOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Gunn talks about his process of making “Superman,” why he’ll never chase a prestige projects and what to expect from “Man of Tomorrow.”\n\nScreengrab courtesy of DC Studios\n\nRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nWhat made “Superman” the hardest film you’ve directed?\n\nThis was the hardest movie I’ve ever made. The next hardest was probably the first “Guardians.” With “Guardians,” you were building a corner of the universe that felt completely different from everything else Marvel was doing at the time. Here, I was reorienting something everyone already thinks they understand. Strangely, it’s the most comic-book-driven thing I’ve ever done. More than any of my other superhero films.\n\nHow did assembling your creative team shape the film?\n\nI’ve worked with many of these people for years. Beth Mickel, my production designer, has been with me on the last three films. Steph Ceretti has overseen visual effects for multiple projects now. Being in charge of DC meant I could finally keep the team together instead of losing people between films. That continuity matters.\n\nWhat were you most proud of in the visual effects, especially with Krypto the Dog?\n\nFramestore’s work on Krypto is extraordinary. I’ll put those shots up against anything I’ve ever seen. ILM was incredible as well. It was just a world-class group of artists working at the highest level.\n\nHow does it feel to be both a filmmaker and a studio head at the same time?\n\nI don’t think it’s ever really been done. Even Walt Disney was more of a producer than a director. It’s an experiment. And yes, sometimes it probably sounds like madness — especially since I don’t make the most conventional films. But I love big spectacle. That’s my jam. I originally said no to the job. I didn’t want to do what Kevin Feige does. But once Peter and I realized we’d be doing it together, it became exciting. I still don’t know if it’s sustainable long-term. It’s a lot. There just aren’t enough hours in the day.\n\nWhat films made you fall in love with movies?\n\nI think the first movie I saw in a theater was “The Aristocats.” Then “The Strongest Man in the World” with Kurt Russell. But it was “Star Wars” that completely changed me. That feeling of entering another world. And then “Raiders of the Lost Ark” made me aware of filmmakers themselves — George Lucas, Steven Spielberg. That’s when it clicked.\n\nHow do you think about prestige versus mainstream filmmaking?\n\nI don’t care about prestige. I mean, sure, would it be cool to be nominated for Best Director or something? Yeah, would I rather have that than not? But it’s not really my concern. Occasionally I have ideas that are more independent movies, but I like making the kind of movies that I make, and I like making pop cinema, for lack of a better term. If I can have those things also be something that are emotionally resonant to people, or affect people in a deeper, more spiritual way, like a lot of people have told me that “Superman” did, a lot of people have told me that “Guardians 3” did, then that’s fantastic. That’s what I would love to be able to do. But I like making the big movies too. There’s an artistry to it, the creative flow. But then I also like the part of it that’s putting the big puzzle together and creating this machine that works for an audience to elicit a reaction from them, whether it’s emotional, whether it’s laughter, whether it’s screaming, whether it’s whatever it is. That’s the fun part of it.\n\nWhy did “Guardians of the Galaxy” feel like the right leap into big-budget filmmaking?\n\nI had walked away from another studio project because they stripped everything personal out of it. Then “Guardians” came along and I thought, no one else can make this movie the way I can. I wanted to make a space opera. I love raccoons. It felt completely me. That’s always been my goal — to make big movies that still feel personal.\n\nWhat can you tell us about “Man of Tomorrow?”\n\nAt its core, it’s about Clark and Lex. I relate to both of them. I relate to Lex’s ambition and obsession — minus the murder. And I relate to Superman’s belief in people, his Midwestern values. They’re two sides of me.\n\nWhat does your partnership with Peter Safran bring to DC Studios?\n\nPeter’s the best. He does everything I don’t do well. He keeps the ship steady, keeps everyone aligned, connects us with Jim Lee and the comics side, and unifies departments that used to operate separately. What we share is a genuine love for these characters. We know what a privilege it is to help shape how people see them now — and that responsibility is something we take seriously.\n\nSee all Academy Award predictions\n\nVariety Awards Circuit: Oscars\n\n\n\n\n\nVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

This post contains details from the series finale of Netflix‘s Stranger Things.\n\nGaten Matarazzo is still processing his farewell to Stranger Things, but of all the emotions he’s feeling as the series finale arrives on Netflix, the biggest one, he says, is relief.\n\nThe fifth and final season wrapped production in December 2024 after an 11-month shoot, and he’s been keeping more than a few secrets since then about what direction the show was headed in.\n\n“I’m like, ‘I want to talk about it so bad,’ and now I get to, which is very nice,” he tells Deadline in an interview just over a day after the finale’s release.\n\nThe episode reveals that only does his character Dustin survive the horrors of the Upside Down, he and his friends finally get to work through some of their traumas, graduate high school and focus once more on the life in front of them, full of possibilities now that the world isn’t on the brink of ending.\\\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDustin is riddled with grief when we meet him in Season 5, about a year and a half after the events of the Season 4 finale, when his confidante Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) sacrificed himself to give the rest of the Hawkins kids a chance to escape the Upside Down. The tension this causes comes to a head in Volume 2, when he picks another fight with Steve (Joe Keery) that eventually leads to an emotional catharsis where he admits how scared he’s been to lose another friend.\n\nGaten Matarazzo Victoria Stevens\n\nThe resolution gives way for Dustin to find more positive expressions of his grief, like giving the graduation speech Eddie once daydreamed of doing and choosing to help his friends hold onto the hope that “maybe it turned out okay” despite the loss and trauma they’ve all experienced over the last few years, Matarazzo says.\n\nIn the interview below, the actor spoke with Deadline about his final days on set, his journey through Dustin’s grief in Season 5, and his thoughts on whether Dustin really believes that Eleven could still be alive.\n\nDEADLINE: How are you feeling now that the finale has been released?\n\nGATEN MATARAZZO: A lot of relief. I like keeping secrets, but to a fault. They bubble up. I’m like, ‘I want to talk about it so bad,’ and now I get to, which is very nice.\n\nDEADLINE: Last time we spoke, it was for Volume 1, and so you teased a little about the emotional arc that was coming for Dustin. In Volume 2, his resentment and anger really comes to a head in that fight with Steve. What was it like working with Joe Keery this season on such an emotionally complicated journey for Dustin?\n\nMATARAZZO: Oh, man, it’s there was a lot of stress involved, especially as we were getting closer, and we started reading the stuff within Volume 2. I was like, ‘Great. Okay, cool. So now the entire year is gonna be built around me being stressed about this fight and this blow up afterwards.’ Even the stuff in [Episode] 7, where we finally kind of settle into it, there’s a lot of nerves going in. There’s a lot of stakes. I love this kid a lot. I love Dustin. I love playing him. I love watching him grow and growing alongside of him, and it breaks my heart to see what a place that he’s in. Also, for it being the last [season], I was inevitably going to grieve that fun-loving side of him and being able to tap into it, because I had to jump into something new and find something something different. But, knowing that it would be with Joe is this most soothing part of it, understanding that I would get to do so alongside somebody who — not only who I trust, but who I’ve seen take on challenges like this and do so with seeming ease.\n\nHe is such a grounded, thoughtful actor, and you can look him in the eyes and fully settle in yourself. He’s very giving. Oh man, it’s hard to explain what acting alongside somebody like him is like, but I think that also comes with being just a good friend of his and him being a good friend of mine. That makes a process like that a hell of a lot easier to where we have the ability to show the ugly parts of ourselves to each other and not feel the awkward pressure of like, ‘I barely know you, so now I have to go and and hug you and cry in your arms.’ I don’t think I could do that with a stranger. Thankfully, it’s somebody as capable as Joe, so it made a big difference for sure.\n\nFrom left: Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery and Gaten Matarazzo in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5\n\nDEADLINE: As you say, it is a much different side of Dustin than we are used to seeing. Was it challenging for you to tap into that?\n\nMATARAZZO: It was something that, at least I was warned about, which is very nice. My biggest challenge there…it wasn’t necessarily digging into grief. I feel like that was something that a lot of actors are expecting to tap into at some point. Part of acting is you’re dealing with [and] showing the scariest parts of being human and doing so on a regular basis, because that’s what people are interested in seeing. That’s what people are drawn towards, because maybe it’s hard to see that and feel that in a day to day in your own life. That’s why I was drawn to acting in the first place, is to be able to do that on a regular basis and learn about it in a low pressure situation where you’re kind of given the ability to do it without judgment, which is very nice and really cool. The hardest part was doing so and still being Dustin. I didn’t just want to be a different guy. I still wanted to feel like him, and I wanted to still show people that there was a part of him that was recognizable. Otherwise, I don’t think people would really be engaged. Who’s this? This is a new person. I really wanted to make sure that people still felt drawn to the kid that they grew up meeting and knowing.\n\nDEADLINE: What parts of Dustin do you felt like you were clinging to in order to make him feel recognizable through that?\n\nMATARAZZO: That’s hard to say. A lot of that’s in the script. A lot of that’s given to you before you go in. So a lot of that work is done in the writers room, and it’s just your job to do justice there. You kind of tap into loss that you’ve experienced throughout your life at some points. And I’ve lost people. I’ve lost people suddenly…you go into a process of remembering what that can feel like, and what’s overwhelming is not just how overwhelmingly sad it is, but, really, how much rage and how much melancholy there is around it. That’s something that I wanted to approach a bit there is that grieving isn’t necessarily always just hiding in your room and blubbering into your pillow. Even after a week or two, you don’t really have that in you anymore. So you find different outlets, and anger is one of them, and stress.\n\nNow that it’s all wrapped up, I think specifically why he took it out on Steve is, a lot of times, it’s so much easier to say goodbye on bad terms than it is on good ones, because you really don’t want to let go of people. Even breakups, it’s so much harder to break up with somebody when you guys are standing there [on] great [terms], and you have respect for each other. I feel like losing people is kind of similar, and maybe if Steve didn’t make it out of this, it would be easier to deal with that if I wasn’t so engaged and invested in that relationship. Maybe cutting him out would make losing him easier. That was like vital, right? I think for Dustin specifically, because I think losing another friend would be too much, so maybe him not being a friend anymore would make it easier.\n\nDEADLINE: Having gone through all of that with the character, how did you feel about Dustin’s graduation speech? He’s finally honoring Eddie in a positive way.\n\nMATARAZZO: Exactly, that’s the way to properly [do it]. Dustin is convinced throughout the whole process that being miserable is the way to service a friend or to remember him, because if he’s not living through his grief and he’s not hurting, then he’s not loving and he’s not missing him properly. He believes that trying to move on and be happy and joke around and make friends and live his life, it feels like he would think of it as a disservice to him, whereas, of course, we know it’s distinctly the opposite. Nobody who loves you would want you to live miserably for them. That would be the scariest thing in the world. That’s something he learns and learns to be excited about. Now, he’s entered a place in his life where he can tell stories about him and listen to his music and show pictures of him to people and talk about him with new friends and reminisce and do so smiling and laugh about it and not have to be on the verge of tears with it. That’s a new part of grief that’s actually quite beautiful, and it’s weirdly fun and refreshing to enter, because it’s inevitable.\n\nYou’re going to have to find a way. These people don’t come back, and so you have to find a way to be okay with that. If you’re not okay with that, accept it. It’s a beautiful thing that Hopper says to Mike at the end of the show of ‘You don’t have to like their choice or understand their choice,’ which is also kind of what Eddie did. Eddie made a choice to run back in, whether it was smart or not or even necessary. That’s still a question as to whether or not it was even necessary for him to do it, which is also gutting. Maybe it was completely preventable, but learning to accept and be okay with understanding [that] it is what happened…you can’t change it, so you might as well do the best you can and live the best you can. [That] is the best takeaway from that, and I think that’s what all of them inevitably have to do. Now they’ve all lost a friend.\n\nFrom left: Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp and Caleb McLaughlin in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: The final scene in the basement at the Wheelers’ is so special. Dustin is the first one to say, ‘I believe’ after Mike’s speech. What did filming that scene mean to you?\n\nMATARAZZO: Oh man, yeah, we anticipated that all day. It was really hard to know how we’re going to deliver that, because you want to distance yourself from as much cheese in that moment as you can, I think. The audience can kind of leave it up to interpretation for them, whatever works for them as to Eleven’s whereabouts, as to whether she’s alive or not, whatever makes you feel better about the show is fully okay for you to do. That’s something that I’ve already seen is kind of a 50/50 split amongst people who’ve watched it, which I think is perfect. That’s exactly how it should be. There should be a debate about it. There should be discourse. There should be no ‘Here’s why this, here’s why this.’ It’s a great way for people to consistently engage in the show. But…I’m not convinced that there is a consensus amongst the group as to whether or not they agree. I don’t know if there is. I don’t know if they all believe, right? I think I would rather leave Dustin’s mindset on that more personal and up to people’s interpretation, even though my mind is kind of made up as to what he feels. If they do believe, it’s so special that they do, and if they don’t, it’s so kind of them to give them to give that to their friends, right? That’s a really special way to wrap it up.\n\nDEADLINE: I like the idea that they are allowing Mike to believe it, even if maybe they don’t. Maybe they’re ‘letting’ themselves believe it, too, even knowing deep down that it probably isn’t true. Lots of layers there.\n\nMATARAZZO: And it’s not sweeping it under the rug, I don’t think. It’s just airing it out. It’s acknowledging collectively that this is how he is deciding to cope with this. Whether he believes it or not, maybe he believes it the least out of them, who knows? But it’s very kind of them to give to each other that that bit of love and hope, and at least the idea that maybe it turned out okay. I think it’s really beautiful.\n\nDEADLINE: That was the final scene you all shot, right?\n\nMATARAZZO: Yeah, that was the last day.\n\nDEADLINE: What was that experience like for you?\n\nMATARAZZO: The best way to do it. It’s in the same set, that same table, that same style…we leave it right where we picked it up. The first day of production on Stranger Things, was the day in the basement for the first D&D scene. That was day one for everybody. It seemed only fitting that the last day wrapped up the way that it started. Matt and Ross, they insisted on that happening. I’m sure there was back and forth from ADs and line producers and people, ‘Yeah, maybe we got to do this, because we didn’t get this finished up.’ And I think they were like, ‘F*ck that. No chance. There’s no way we wrap it up with anything else.’ That was very important to them and important to us, and it paid off.\n\nDEADLINE: I heard that you went to a theater to see the finale with fans…in disguise? How was that?\n\nMATARAZZO: I did. It was wonderful. I just wanted to make sure I can hear people see it for the first time. You know what I mean? I just wanted to feel an energy. I wanted to see people in T-shirts and in friend groups. It’s not something we’ve been able to experience before, seeing people experience the show for the first time. That’s really, really special, and it’s kind of the only opportunity we’ve ever — I mean, I guess I could have at some point I could’ve gone to a random house and been, like, ‘I want to see this,’ but that would have been weird. That would have been odd.\n\nGaten Matarazzo and Joe Keery in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nSo, everybody was given the opportunity to go and experience it together, collectively, and understand that there’s something so special about the community. That is a theater and the importance that it brings to movie making and cinema. There’s obviously a very glaring juxtaposition, being a huge streamer and a catalyst for TV and film being watched from home, and the convenience of that. Matt and Ross really did push. It was very important to them that this is experienced to the scale in which they always intended for it to be. I’m just happy that it happened. I’m happy that they were able to make it work.\n\nDEADLINE: You’ve worked on this show for a decade of your life. It’s so rare for shows to continue for so long, and particularly in the case of Stranger Things, for much of it there was not a question about whether it would end unceremoniously. It was very consistent in a rare way. How formative was that for you as a young actor?\n\nMATARAZZO: It’s something that I know actively not to take for granted and to acknowledge how special and rare a process like that really is. Because quality isn’t even a measure of whether something runs for a while or not. There’s so many great shows that, for one reason or another, whether it’s a scheduling issue, whether it’s a budgeting issue, a ratings issue, they struggle to ensure seeing their show through the way it was supposed to. Once we got into the groove of [Stranger Things], after our second season, going into [Season] 3, it seemed like it was very clear that Matt and Ross were going to be able to make whatever decisions they wanted to make to see the show finish the way they want to see it finish. That is so special and so rare, and it’s going to be very hard to acknowledge the fact that that’s not something that will ever, probably, come again to the scale in which it did. That’s something I’m honored to have been a part of and something I’m sure I’ll look back on and be like, ‘Yeah, this was crazy.’\n\nDEADLINE: What are you looking forward to now?\n\nMATARAZZO: Oh, man. I’m looking forward to not knowing what’s next. That’s something I would like to optimistically look at. That’s something that also is a source of a lot of anxiety, because I’ve been very used to, like you said, having consistency in what I’ve done in this show. Whether things dry out between seasons, or whether I don’t like a project that I do or it doesn’t really mesh the way I wanted it to, at least I can go back into another [season of Stranger Things] and get a groove back going. But now it really is a matter of just deciding what’s next and shaping up what I would like my career to look like, and I’m not sure what that is yet, and I think it’s just a matter of step by step understanding. I’m not too worried about a five-year plan, a 10-year plan. I would like to spend this time looking directly in front of me and seeing what comes up and what opportunities fall my way, and maybe even jumping into things where I can potentially create my own opportunities in some way. I don’t really know what that would entail or would look like, but I’m excited to not know.\n\nDEADLINE: Are there any particular opportunities that would intrigue you? Whether that’s a genre or character archetype you’d want to explore, or perhaps stepping into a role off camera?\n\nMATARAZZO: Yeah, that’s a good question. I really am not concerned genre-wise. If it’s something that looks like it’s going to challenge me, then that’s something I’m interested in. If it looks like a learning experience, then I’m interested. A lot of times things will come through like, ‘This would be really fun. I’m sure it would fill time nicely. I think I’m comfortable in that type of part.’ Usually, when I see things like that, it’s something I probably will not take. Also, I must acknowledge the fact that it’s very rare that working actors have the opportunity to be able to choose what they want their career to look like, to shape their career in the way they want to represent themselves.\n\nThe show has given me the consistency and work and financial ability to be able to make that decision of something coming through and saying, ‘I don’t need to do that right now. I’m fine. I’ll wait it off and wait for the next thing to come around.’ That’s not how working as an actor usually is. You take what you can get and you just grind and consistently do as much as you can, because you never these opportunities aren’t guaranteed no matter what you’re doing and for how consistently you do it. It’s a freelance career, and I’m very lucky to be in a position where I can choose what I want to do and what I don’t. That’s something I will cherish and not take for granted going forward.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 21:35:59 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T21:41:57.515149"}

Dustin — a fan-favorite from the very first episode because of his infectious optimism and unapologetic nerdiness — is no exception. The hero uses his best qualities to contribute to archvillain Vecna’s (Jamie Campbell Bower) defeat. However, the character’s most memorable scene comes in the episode’s final act, when Dustin delivers his graduation speech as Hawkins High School’s Class of 1989 valedictorian. Articulating the themes of the show, Dustin speaks with endearing authority about how friendships have been forged and strengthened through strife. He then shifts his tone, ending the speech by telling off Principal Higgins (Bill Winkler) and shedding his robes for a Hellfire Club T-shirt, riffing on Eddie Munson’s (Joseph Quinn) iconic Season 4 line, “This is our year!” to thunderous applause.\n\n“A lot of shows don’t really give characters the opportunity to kind of just, for lack of a better word, talk shit and air everything out and speak unapologetically about the way they feel,” Matarazzo says of the experience. “I didn’t take for granted how special that opportunity was.”\n\nDespite tense moments aplenty, the finale concludes Dustin’s story on an optimistic note, showing him going to college and still making time for adventures with his unlikely best friend from the past few seasons, Steve Harrington (Joe Keery).\n\nVariety spoke with Matarazzo about his experience closing the book on “Stranger Things” after nearly a decade of growing up with Dustin.\n\nWhen did you find out that the “Stranger Things” finale would play in theaters?\n\nOfficially we found out when it was released to the public. I think we expected it, but there were times when they said they weren’t doing it, but it kept coming up throughout the show. Matt and Ross had been trying to get it done for a while and all of us kept going back to them asking for updates. We’d ask if there was anything we could say to make it happen and they’d say, “No.” They had to work it out on their end because it went against the model that Netflix created and it wasn’t something that had ever been done for TV before. They’d done it for movies, though, so that was probably the kicker. It ended up being put together really quickly once it was confirmed. We went from hearing that it’s not going to happen to, “Never mind, it’s a go” kind of out of nowhere.\n\nDid you get a chance to see it in theaters with an audience?\n\nYeah, I went with my mom and my siblings when we were visiting her in Jacksonville for the holidays. We made sure that we reserved spots at a theater nearby. The theater itself was actually quite small, so it was really just like four or five other families. I went dressed fully as the Grinch so no one recognized me, but the theater was small enough that I was like “Ah, whatever” and took the mask off.\n\nThe finale looks great in the theater, especially those scenes in the Abyss. What was it like choreographing those battles with the giant Mind Flayer?\n\nOh man, those days were crazy. They can be the most stressful days because you’re not saying much for a long time. You’ll just be doing so much cardio and then you look up at a tennis ball and go “Ahhhh” and hope it looks good. Luckily, when we ended up watching it, it looks great. The final form of the Mind Flayer, that crazy big Lovecraftian thing, looks unreal.\n\nI know that my theater was very nervous for the fate of all the characters. Did you know how Dustin’s story would end before reading the final script? Were you ever worried that he might not make it?\n\nWe were all curious going in, and I think everyone was open to the idea of our characters dying, but I just don’t think that was the show that they really had in mind. A lot of the obsession with who’s dying was more fan-pushed than anything. I could be wrong, but I don’t think the creative team ever really pushed that the main characters wouldn’t make it out alive. And I think that ultimately ended up being a really great way to define what the show was about. It’s about persevering through unimaginable odds. I think there’s something special there. The point is that the kids make it through, so I was never really scared. Also, if one of us was dying, I feel like they would have told us before the writing process even started. It’s not something they would have sprung on us in the table read. They would have told us individually if it was coming.\n\nWhat was your reaction to finding out where Dustin ends up at the end of the series?\n\nIt’s such a relief. They’ve all been through so much, so to see him going forward and taking a breath and finally having a shred of normalcy — it’s all he really could have asked for. And that’s what’s so tragic about the end of Eleven’s story. Normalcy would never be guaranteed for the people that she loves if she was there. She didn’t see it as fair, and I think it was a beautiful choice to end her story the way that they did.\n\nDo you have a personal belief in whether or not Eleven is alive?\n\nI do, but I want to keep that private. I don’t know if others will, but I think that whatever works for you and makes the show wrap up better for you is correct. You have the right to debate it, but whatever you want it to be for you is great. I think they teeter that line very well, because I’ve already noticed a kind of 50/50 split amongst fans about whether they believe.\n\nHow was it preparing and delivering Dustin’s graduation speech where he gets to sum up the point of the show, but also stick it to the principal one last time?\n\nOh, it was fun. It was a really special opportunity to be given that monologue. It can be a bit stressful to say all those words, especially in front of such a large audience, but a lot of shows don’t really give characters the opportunity to kind of just, for lack of a better word, talk shit and air everything out and speak unapologetically about the way they feel. I didn’t take for granted how special that opportunity was. It also shows that Dustin is in a vastly better place from the start of the season.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nDustin has a lot of really emotional scenes in Season 5. How did it feel to tap into the darker, sadder sides of this typically optimistic character?\n\nIt was weird. It was definitely on the scarier side. I love the show so much, and I was really excited to jump back into what I did in the previous four seasons, so the change was kind of a curve ball thrown out of nowhere and nerve-racking, but I understood it. I was a little anxious, but I felt very honored that Matt and Ross trusted me to approach Dustin differently and give me what I saw as a challenge. I’m always up for a tone shift, and it was a kind of performance that Matt and Ross had never seen me do. There are worlds where actors excel in different genres and styles, but when called upon to jump into something tonally different, it can feel clunky. I wanted to try giving everything I got to be as truthful as I could and service the story the way it deserves. So there was a little bit more pressure, but I was super up for the opportunity. I found it really cool, cathartic and sometimes very fun.\n\nBecause Dustin sort of inherits Eddie’s persona in Hawkins for Season 5, I’m curious if you ever reconnected with Joseph Quinn and discussed your characters going into the final season?\n\nNot much. I think it was kind of the point that Dustin didn’t get to talk to him as much as he wanted. I had to be as truthful as I could and not ask him too much, because Dustin doesn’t have the opportunity to ask Eddie very much. He has to learn as he goes. The one thing I did ask is if there was any music he listened to to prep, because Eddie’s uncle gave Dustin Eddie’s tapes. It was a great playlist, and I listened to a good chunk of that. I don’t know if that’s something he likes to keep private or not, but it was a lot of good stuff. It actually ended up shifting my taste in music for the year quite a bit.\n\nDustin and Steve have become one of the show’s most iconic duos. Did you ever anticipate this for the characters in the early seasons? How has your relationship with Joe Keery developed over the years? Joe is the absolute best. He’s the MVP of every room he walks into, and I don’t think he even knows it. He has a leadership quality that he doesn’t demand, but commands, seemingly without trying. He’s a strong actor, a very thoughtful actor, very grounded, a good friend and a tremendously funny guy. It was something that I was so excited to approach when Season 2 started when we had a few scenes together. Before that I didn’t think I’d ever get to work with him, so I was excited to take the opportunity while it was there. Thankfully, it just clicked. I think it’s because these characters were at a crossroads, and we were trying to figure out what to do with them. No one really knew what was next for them. They attempted a bit of a tug-of-war, will-they-won’t-they thing with both Dustin and Lucas [Caleb McLaughlin] having crushes on Max [Sadie Sink], but it was so clear that Caleb and Sadie just had such incredible chemistry and those characters just worked so well together that they ditched the rivalry. That was the train-track scene, Dustin trying to figure out how he can approach telling Max that he likes her and then it’s so funny how literally they drop it instantly after that. Lucas and Max end up together because it just wasn’t clunky and keeping Dustin in that plot would have been weird and bloated. Similarly, Nancy and Jonathan were clearly the couple that were going to be working consistently as the season went on, so it was like “What the fuck do we do with Dustin and Steve right now?” Because they were both kind of dealing with similar predicaments in their love lives and they kind of had something to relate to there. Thankfully, there was a quality that worked between us and we locked into it.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nSeason 5 also introduces a slew of younger characters. What was it like to no longer be the youngest actors on set, and to have these kids around and probably looking up to you? They’re the best, talented group of kids. I was so excited for them and their opportunity. They held it down so well, and they brought such a cool energy to such a cool plot line. It’s one of those things that Matt, Ross and Carmen [Cuba], the casting director, seem to have a gauge for and understanding of, because when it comes to casting kids in TV, it’s not just what comes across off the page and whether something works, it’s gauging whether or not there’s going to be an ease in a work environment. It’s hard to put the expectations of a very big show running smoothly in the hands of children. That’s kind of what was thrusted upon us when we were quite young, but I think they found out how to do it properly and get the right people. These kids are so talented and so kind and I think they had a good time doing it. It was so nice to get to know them and see them experience the show the way that we did, but through a lens of a little more experience. That was really special.\n\nYou’ve basically spent your entire adolescence playing Dustin. How has growing up with this character affected you over the years?\n\nWeirdly, it’s basically shaped everything about me, but I don’t think there’s any other way it could have happened. I spent so much of my time invested in trying to figure out who he was and I think I inevitably learned a lot about myself alongside him. Caleb has always said something really special and really interesting, which is that he knew Lucas before he knew himself, and that’s such an interesting perspective. I never thought of it that way, but he’s right. So much of our time and energy is focused on figuring out somebody that we are not and, inevitably, you end up inadvertently learning about yourself through that. And that’s really cool, so I think that I’m a very different person because of Dustin. I think that I am shaped into a different type of guy because I spend so much of my time shaping who he was. I always consider what i would be like as a person without the show and I’m hyper-convinced that I would be a worse one. It helped me prioritize the people in my life, and I love them very, very much.\n\nDo you have a favorite moment from the series as a whole, either on-screen or on set?\n\nThat’s such a good question, because now I can finally put it all into perspective and figure out what that really is for me, but it’s so tough. Seasons 4 and 5 feel like one chapter. It feels like one, very long season where they introduce Vecna and it’s like, “OK, great. This is the show now and it feels like one big chapter.” And I had so much fun doing all of what we called the “Scooby-Doo Group,” stuff with the Hawkins investigative crew in Season 4 in the Creel House, figuring out Henry’s backstory and trying to save Max. That was really cool, so I think that was my favorite.\n\nWho on the cast have you grown closest with over the years and who have you learned the most from?\n\nThat’s so tough. I love everybody on the show so much. They are literally family, and I have such wonderful individual relationships with all of them. They’re so distinct from each other and that’s what’s so special. You know how some friend groups feel like you can’t imagine yourself hanging out with any of them individually? Like when work friends grab drinks, and it’s like, “I don’t think I can ever talk to any of these people by themselves.” I’m so happy that all of us have had the ability to maintain real friendships individually with each other throughout this process. I’m super grateful for that. I lived with Finn [Wolfhard] for about a year, and I think that cemented a cadence that you don’t really get with a person until you spend your mornings and nights with them consistently. It almost sounds like a couple, but we had this very shared experience with the show and getting to see him finish his movie, sell his movie, write his album and watch it all get released was really cool. And Caleb, I’ve never been able to have a heart to heart with anybody as much as I have with Caleb. There’s just a quality that he has. You just feel so safe with him and I just appreciate his candor and the level of respect he has for people. He shows what it means to be a really good friend and he’s taught me a lot.\n\nNow that the show is over, what do you hope Dustin’s legacy is for fans of “Stranger Things”?\n\nI’m thinking of a word that might seem inconsequential, but I don’t think that it is in the context of Dustin, and that’s “Enthusiasm.” I think something that’s so interesting about Dustin is that every time they’re in grave danger, he’s always kind of smiling. I think that it’s because he’s fully aware and acknowledges how fucking cool everything is. Like, they’re gonna die, they’re literally saving the world, but he’s still floored that he might be the first person to be in contact with exotic matter. He’s so excited and he’s so unapologetically nerdy and so invested in his interests and excited to learn. It’s very Mr. Clarke [Randy Havens]-esque. He’s so excited to learn about what he doesn’t know. A lot of people approach what they don’t know with angst or anxiety because the unknown is scary, but to Dustin, the unknown is the most exhilarating feeling in the world, because he has nothing but a drive to learn more about it. It’s really fun and it’s something that I strive to embody myself.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 22:23:05 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T22:27:06.324918"}

Hobbs, a directing duo who also led Discovery+’s “House of Hammer,” which chronicled sexual abuse allegations and the checkered family history of actor Armie Hammer.​\n\nBelow, we broke down the biggest revelations from the docuseries.\n\nCosby’s ex-boyfriend claims she was a childhood bully​\n\nMichael Enoch, a former member of Faith Temple Church and Cosby’s self-proclaimed childhood boyfriend, describes the reality star as having a mean streak as a kid: “Mary was a bully. I remember Mary picking on certain girls and controlling them. When you’re kids, you see these things and don’t think much of it. But as an adult, you look back on it. And she wasn’t a nice person.”\n\nCosby marries her step-grandfather after her grandmother died\n\nIn Season 1 of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” Cosby appeared with her husband, Robert Sr., discussing how her late grandmother arranged for her to marry her step-grandfather as expressed in her will. “She said if anything ever happens to me, I want you to marry one of my girls because they’ll look out for you,” Robert Sr. said during their confessional. The two, married since 1998 when Mary was in her early 20s, and Robert Sr. was 20 years her senior, share a son named Robert Jr.\n\nAudio leaks of Cosby berating her congregation​\n\nIn an audio clip that was allegedly obtained from someone inside the church, the documentary includes a resurfaced sound bite of Cosby speaking to members of her church, in which she called them “poor” and “stingy” for giving her only 14 birthday cards and not contributing enough with their tithes. Former church member and organist Ernest Enoch says he was present during the incident, and claims he gave her a birthday card with $1,000 inside.\n\nFormer members claim they felt forced to pay large payments in offerings\n\n​In addition to tithing, former churchgoers allege that the Cosbys would have six-month heave offerings, in which they would pressure members to make large financial sacrifices for the advancement of the church. Ex-church member Rosalind Enoch also claims that a week in between their heave offerings, they would also be told the church needed urgent financial assistance with offering requests up to $100,000 within a few days.\n\nRosalind also says members cashed out their 401Ks and mortgaged their homes in order to pay large sums to the church. “We would have these meetings after church, and Robert would instruct ushers to stand at the doors. You’re barricaded in there,” she says. “During this meeting, everyone put their name and amount on the list. If you didn’t have a certain amount, Robert would say, ‘And that’s all you have.’”\n\nCosby’s first cousin accuses her of having an affair​\n\nDan Cosby said ex-congregant Cameron Williams — who died after his appearance on “RHOSLC” in 2021 from complications after a brain tumor — talks about having an intimate relationship with Cosby. During a phone call, Dan says that Cameron told him Mary went to his house and requested that he put on music. After sitting beside her, Cameron allegedly told Dan, Mary grabbed his hand and started “rubbing her.”\n\nDan recalls, “According to Cameron, he put his hand in her vagina.” Dan continues, saying Cameron told him, “Then, we had sex.” In an audio clip with Dan, Cameron says, “We had the affair and all that, but that was me being victimized. It had to take therapy for me to get out of that.” Ernest also reveals that Cameron told him about the affair.\n\nFamily members claim Robert Sr. was abusive\n\n​In the documentary, Sam Kelly, Cosby’s uncle, describes Robert Sr. as having a two-faced personality and exhibiting cruel behavior toward him as a child. Growing up, Kelly recalls having meetings with Robert Sr. and other church elders where they would gather the young men of the church over the weekend for lessons designed for their personal development.\n\nDuring those lessons, Dan and Kelly allege that Robert Sr. would force them to do pushups, sprint around the church, hold books while running in place, among other tasks. “He and some of the older elders were in the military, and they were putting that in us as kids,” Dan says while holding back tears. “For example, taking a pin and putting it under your knees so you wouldn’t hit the pin or it wouldn’t stick to you. I remember a kid couldn’t do a pushup or a sit up, and one of the elders kicked him.”\n\nCosby was excommunicated from the church as a young adult\n\nAccording to family members, Cosby had a difficult childhood where she allegedly would run away from home several times, skip school and frequently clash with her mother. Their strained relationship led to her grandmother stepping in to help take care of Cosby. Her troubled behavior reached a point where she was disfellowshipped from Faith Temple Church. While shunned, Cosby’s grandmother died.\n\nCosby allegedly divorced her first husband to marry Robert Sr.\n\n​Investigative journalist Cheyenne Roundtree found Cosby’s divorce and marriage records, which reveal that she married Robert Sr. 19 days after her divorce was finalized. After Cosby’s grandmother died, her family wasn’t supportive of her marriage to Robert Sr.\n\nDuring a walkout service, Cosby’s mother stood in the pulpit and publicly rejected their marriage in front of the congregation. “All these lies have been put out, that is not God,” she said in a video clip. “You hear me today. If this is my last stand in the pulpit, that is not God what’s going on around here.”\n\nFinancial abuse claims\n\nAccording to Roundtree, several church members told her they were expected to run errands, clean and manage bills, among other responsibilities, for Cosby and Robert Sr., free of charge. For five years, Rosalind — who at one point lived with the couple — says she was responsible for housekeeping and running errands. “I was never paid,” she says in the documentary. “I was collecting unemployment. I guess that’s what they thought I would live on. It was more like a slave plantation.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 22:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T22:27:06.882332"}

Overhead boom microphones were eliminated. Hidden mics replaced them. Cameras were locked off. For the most private scenes, the crew quietly stepped away.\n\n“I wanted to disarm the space,” Winslet explains. “To remove the things that pull actors out of themselves.”\n\nThe result is a film that finds humor inside grief without softening its truth. “Life doesn’t stop being funny just because it’s painful,” Winslet shares. “Sometimes laughter is the only way through.”\n\nFor a first-time director, Winslet’s approach feels both considered and instinctive, rooted in empathy and trust. Whether “Goodbye June” marks the beginning of a new chapter or a singular act remains to be seen. But for now, Winslet is allowing herself a moment to acknowledge what she’s built.\n\n“I really did it,” she says, still sounding slightly surprised.\n\nOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Winslet talks about preparing for this moment in her career, working with her son, and what she wants to do next.\n\n“Goodbye June” stars Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet. (Kimberley French / Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection) ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nHow did your experience as an actor shape the way you directed?\n\nI knew immediately how to bypass things that wouldn’t be helpful. What surprised me was how different every actor’s needs were. Each person needed something specific from me, and adapting to that was wonderful. It meant learning who they were, what they needed to feel safe — and building trust. That trust was everything.\n\nTalk about the choices to eliminate boom microphones on set.\n\nAs an actor, I find them incredibly distracting. They move, they hover, and I always feel bad for the person holding them. Boom operators are brilliant, but they anticipate movement — and if an actor changes their mind mid-take, it can throw you out of the moment. I wanted to remove that distraction. We also had children in the film, and little kids always look up at the big black thing waving above their heads. Without booms, that problem disappeared.\n\nWhat led you to lock off cameras and clear the set for intimate scenes?\n\nIn the quietest scenes — between Helen Mirren and Timothy Spall, or Toni Collette and Helen in the hospital bathroom — the actors were completely alone. Cameras were rolling, but no one was operating them. Helen said to me, “I’ve never had that in my life, and I’m so grateful.” That meant everything. It allowed a different emotional texture to emerge — something very real.\n\nHow did you balance grief with humor in the film?\n\nThat balance was essential. When you’re facing tragedy, laughter still happens — sometimes at moments that feel inappropriate. When my own mother was five days from passing, she told my daughter she should take her bras because she wouldn’t need them anymore. We laughed. That moment was how my daughter understood she was losing her grandmother. That’s life. Humor is part of it.\n\nHow did you manage a 35-day shoot with Helen Mirren for only 16 days?\n\nI’m a forward thinker. If you’re number one on the call sheet and you slow things down, you jeopardize the entire day. With a schedule like that, you cannot afford to drop a scene — you may never get it back. My prep with my DP, Alvin Küchler, was incredibly detailed. He practically moved into my house for a week. We planned everything.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge about directing yourself?\n\nThat was the one thing I didn’t know how I’d handle. I had to be ready with multiple choices for myself so that in the edit I’d have options. My instinct is never to put myself first, so I’d always prioritize coverage of the other actors — and then realize I had to rush my own. It was insane. But also exhilarating.\n\nDid your photographic memory surprise you in the edit?\n\nI could remember specific takes—what worked, what didn’t. I’d say to my editor, Lucia Zucchetti, “Stay on take five.” She’d question it, and I’d say, “No, trust me.” And I was right. That helped us maintain a strong emotional through line.\n\nWhat was it like collaborating with your son, Joe Anders, on the screenplay?\n\nJoe doesn’t know how I work on set, and I can’t teach my children how to do this job. They have to find their own way. I’m incredibly proud of both my kids because they’re carving their own paths. Collaborating with your child — and having meaningful creative conversations — is very special.\n\nWhat struck you most about Timothy Spall’s performance?\n\nThere’s a moment when his character is asked, “Do you still love her?” He says nothing. It’s all in his eyes. The hurt, the betrayal — you see his heart crack open. It’s some of the best acting I’ve ever witnessed.\n\nHow did you approach the film’s visual language?\n\nThis is a messy, complicated family living with long-term illness. I didn’t want cancer to become the narrative. That’s not the story. The story is how a family is pulled closer together. Early on, I hold back visually — it’s the space between people that tells us how distant they are.\n\nDo you want to direct again?\n\nI would love to. I genuinely would. I’ve only just delivered the film, so I don’t know yet — but yes, I’d love to.\n\nWhat was it like returning to “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and what did it remind you about acting?\n\nI shot it years ago, but the experience was extraordinary. The training was intense. Jim Cameron’s passion is unmatched. And as I get older, I realize how much I love being in a pack with other actors. That energy matters. I was fortunate to be part of it.\n\nSee all Academy Award predictions\n\nVariety Awards Circuit: Oscars\n\n\n\n\n\nVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

They were too young to be aware of my work. Instead, there was some sort of visceral reaction from them.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nIn the doc, Community director Jay Chandrasekhar says that Chase had an on-set “meltdown” following the incident in which the former SNL cast member apparently used the N-word in a conversation with co-star Yvette Nicole Brown, who is Black.\n\nWhile he didn’t actually hear the conversation between the two actors, Chandrasekhar says in the doc that he “was there, directing, the night that Chevy Chase got fired from Community.” Chandrasekhar says the event stemmed from a scripted “blackface” hand puppet bit involving Chase’s Community character Pierce Hawthorne.\n\nChase, as detailed in a Deadline report at the time, was unhappy with his character’s racist development, and said something along the lines that soon the writers would be having him say the N-word. Only he didn’t say “N-word.”\n\nBrown took to social media yesterday and emphasized that no one can speak for her or for her personal experiences on the show.\n\n“There are things I’ve never spoken of publicly and perhaps never will. Anyone currently speaking FOR or ABOUT me with perceived authority is speaking without EVER speaking to me about the things they claim to know about,” she wrote in a statement on Threads. “They actually don’t really know me — at all.”\n\nShe continued, “They also have no knowledge of my relationship with anyone l’ve worked with & cannot credibly speak on any current or previous issues. I hate that all this had to be said. In East Cleveland speak: Keep my name out your mouth.”\n\nChase, reflecting on his time on Community and departure from the show, said, “It wasn’t a bad experience. I just didn’t think it was that good, the show.”\n\nOn the topic of explaining himself and his past actions, Chase said, “I don’t have any need to do that. The whole issue of them thinking I’m an [expletive], it’s all junk. I don’t care much about it. I have a great, great life, a wonderful family.”\n\nAsked if his actions hurt his career, the comedian responded, “I don’t think I sabotaged my career. I think we go up and down and up and down, up and down. You make mistakes. You make mistakes. You don’t make so many mistakes. You learn more, and then you get to where I am now, where I don’t think any of that matters anymore.

Dokoupil, who has been a co-host on CBS Mornings, will be the sixth anchor of the newscast in the past 10 years. A revamp of the CBS [&#8230;]", "content": "CBS Evening News has unveiled “five simple principles” to guide the broadcast, as Tony Dokoupil prepares to take over as the new anchor of the broadcast on Monday.\n\nDokoupil, who has been a co-host on CBS Mornings, will be the sixth anchor of the newscast in the past 10 years. A revamp of the CBS Evening News has been one of the priorities of Bari Weiss, the founder of center-right opinion site The Free Press who was named in October to lead the news division.\n\nThe principles are:\n\nWe work for you. That means you come first. Not our advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests, including the corporate owners of CBS News. We report on the world as it is. We’ll be honest and direct with you. That means no weasel words or padded landings. We’ll tell you what we know, when we know it. Well update our reporting when we uncover new facts. And we’ll admit when we get it wrong. We respect you. We believe that our fellow Americans are smart and discerning. It’s our job to present you with the fullest picture — and the strongest voices on all sides of an issue. We trust you to make up your own minds, and to make the decisions that are best for you, your families and your communities. We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so. Our foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth. We also believe in Franklin’s famous line about America as a republic — if we can keep it. We aim to do our part every night: One way to think about our show is as a daily conversation about exactly where we are as a country and where we are going. We respect tradition, but we also believe in the future. We embrace the tools that allow us to reach you where you are. Some of you will watch this show on linear television. Others will increasingly watch it on social media. What we can guarantee is that the tools will continue to change — but some things never will. One of those things is honest journalism.\n\nSome of the principles reflect remarks that Dokoupil made in a video that debuted on Thursday. In those comments, he also addressed the issue of trust, saying that “on too many stories the press has missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you. And I know this because, at certain points, I have been you. I have felt this way too. I have felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn’t reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life. And that the most urgent questions simply weren’t being asked.”\n\n\n\n“So here’s my promise to you today and every time you see me in this chair: you come first. Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And, yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS. I report for you.”\n\nDokoupil is taking the network anchor chair at a time of intense scrutiny over Weiss and the motives of new Paramount CEO David Ellison. It comes at a time when the corporate parent is making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, a massive transaction that will need Trump administration approval.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSome moves have fed suspicions that the Paramount owners are moving the news division rightward, in ways that will ultimately please Trump. As it sought the Trump FCC approval of its acquisition of Paramount, Ellison’s Skydance committed to hiring an ombudsman to take complaints about news coverage. The person selected, Kenneth R. Weinstein, is the former president and CEO of the Hudson Institute, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nWeiss, meanwhile, generated a recent furor among some staffers at CBS News when she ordered a 60 Minutes segment on Trump’s deportations pulled, even though it had already been completed and promoted. Among other things, Weiss said that the segment was “not ready” and that it needed to “get the principals on the record and on camera.” The segment, which was mistakenly posted online by one of the network’s Canadian partners, noted that they had sought an interview with Trump Department of Homeland Security officials but were declined.\n\nCorrespondent Sharyn Alfonsi said in a memo to colleagues that they “requested responses to questions and/or interviews with DHS, the White House and the State Department. Government silence is a statement, not a VETO. Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.”\n\nShe wrote that “if the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.” She wrote that the pulling of the story was “political” and a case of corporate interference.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 22:20:43 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T22:27:07.745590"}

Zak Hilditch, who wrote and directed the new zombie feature “We Bury the Dead,” out today via Vertical, has seen the noise make audiences shudder in real time, as it’s the signature of the undead in his film.\n\n“When I was delving into the zombie world, we didn’t have all the money in the world, so how do I make these things unique?” Hilditch says. “This idea of growing agitation, what does that look and sound like? It sounds like teeth grinding to me. So that was something even I was milking as much as I possibly could, wherever I could, as it was going to be a really interesting thing to have echo throughout the film. That particular sound was something that the sound team, before we even shot the movie, was most excited about delving into because they could see the possibilities there.\n\n“It’s been interesting watching the film internationally this year, on the festival junket,” he continues. “When we hit that sound, it’s aching, like nails on a chalkboard. There were versions where it was even more extreme, and we had to pull it back a little bit to make it palatable for an audience. That was just one example of how this isn’t a big studio film at all, yet we did everything we could to put you in that headspace. The sound was so important in helping guide that through.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn the film, Ava Newman (“Star Wars” alum Daisy Ridley) heads to Australia to find and recover her husband after a military accident. Unfortunately, the dead are rising after the incident, and Ava must avoid the teeth-grinding zombies.\n\n“Dead” is the Australia-based auteur’s eighth feature, and Hilditch was inspired to write it by the passing of his mother.\n\n“It was a personal initial kernel of an idea,” he says. “When it comes to grief, realizing there is no silver bullet or a special guidebook to get you through. When my mum passed, it was my job to pack down the family house that I grew up in, which she died in. It was weirdly cathartic having something physical to do. As a filmmaker, there was a part of me thinking, ‘I’m going room to room and making these discoveries.’ There’s something quite intimate yet surreal about it. I thought that there was something worth mining in terms of grief.”\n\nHilditch says that Ridley signing on for the project added an essential layer of humanity to the film.\n\n“It was just unbelievable,” he says. “She was the very first actress we sent the script to, and within one week, we were Zooming. She was absolutely perfect for the role: Right time, right place. When she arrived on set, seeing that side of her and how she was all-in on this character and my words that I had spewed out on the page … You see her taking that and turning it into a living, breathing entity that goes far beyond your wildest expectations of what this was going to be.”\n\nHilditch says “the whole movie rests on Ridley’s shoulders, and she absolutely crushed it.”\n\n“I can’t wait for people to see her in this light. I don’t think she’s done something quite like this before,” he adds. “To be plucked from the millions of people who would have died to play Rey, and get through all those three films, and then moving on to the next phase of your filmmaking life as an actor … She’s got a very eclectic bunch of tastes. I’m just really lucky that she saw something in my pages.”\n\nAs for the future, Hilditch loves working in horror but is most drawn in to stories led by dynamic characters, no matter the genre.\n\n“I just love ordinary people caught in extraordinary situations,” he says. “This is exactly an example of that. I definitely won’t be going back into zombie tales anytime soon. I never thought I was going to make a zombie movie until I made ‘We Bury the Dead.’ I only wanted to do it if I was able to say something new or interesting. I think I managed to find a fresh enough way to give people the zombie lore that they all have come to expect, but to really pull the rug on your expectations at the same time. If it can still do that, that’s an amazing thing in this modern age.”\n\nWatch the trailer for “We Bury the Dead” below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:17:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T23:24:53.841125"}

Strip out China, and the global hike is about 8%, much better than the roughly 11% decrease we saw from the end of 2023 through 2024. The international box office, sans China, is forecast at $17.2B, also a 12% jump over last year. With China factored in, overseas is looking at $24.6B (+16%).\n\nIn general, when we sum up 2025, there’s good and not-so-hot news at the global and international box office but also optimism amid some uncertainty on the horizon. Windows remain a talking point — particularly amid a potential acquisition of a legacy studio by a streamer — as does volume and the shifting of moviegoing habits. And, though they may seem way in the past, the 2023 strikes also ended up impacting 2025 and the sequencing of when films could be finished. The year ahead should help to mitigate more of the impact.\n\nOne international distribution executive characterized 2025 as “a little disappointing” but also noted: “I think you can look forward to ’26 with some optimism that things are going to turn around. … Everybody measures this industry against 2019, which was pre-Covid, but that was also the all-time record year. Certainly at some point we’ll get back to those box office levels, just through inflation and more premium screens and currency. But I don’t know if we ever get back to those admission levels, just because I think consumer habits might have changed.”\n\nRELATED: 2025 Moviegoer Attendance Hits 780M, -5% From ’24; Majority Went To Cinemas During Pics’ First 30 Days Of Release\n\nLike every year, there were ups and downs in 2025, but it’s clear that there is still an audience for a theatrical event and the continuation of beloved franchises. The year started off slowly for Hollywood, with the first real breakout, Warner Bros’ A Minecraft Movie, catapulting us into the spring. It was followed by Disney’s Lilo & Stitch, which became the first billion-dollar movie for the studios in 2025, with 59.2% of business from overseas. Just last month, Disney’s Zootopia 2 exceeded that film as Dis reached an estimated $6.58B worldwide ($4.08B from the international space). That’s the biggest year for any studio since 2019. Also contributing, 20th Century’s Avatar: Fire and Ash will cross $1B this week.\n\nSee below for the global/international studio rankings chart.\n\nAfter Minecraft got the ball rolling, Paramount’s Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning did 67% of its nearly $600M global business in offshore markets — making it the No. 9 title on the overseas chart — and played at the same time as Lilo & Stitch. Then Universal returned to How to Train Your Dragon (58.7% from overseas) and Jurassic World with Rebirth (61% internationally), and Apple’s F1 (via WB) roared with 70% of its haul from offshore.\n\nRELATED: Deadline’s Critics Pick Their Top 10 Films Of 2025\n\nJapan got a jolt in midsummer with Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Infinity Castle, which carried into the fall as the movie released in markets outside Asia via Sony and Crunchyroll and including domestic, ultimately landing in the Top 10 worldwide. The early autumn, arguably apart from WB’s The Conjuring: Last Rites, was somewhat quiet, but things ramped up again with Universal’s Wicked: For Good, followed by Zoo 2 and Avatar.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there also were a number of bright spots for WB with titles including Final Destination Bloodlines, One Battle After Another, Sinners and Weapons. Although the latter two were bigger domestic plays, the studio reached nearly $4.4B on just 11 titles versus 20 the previous year.\n\nInternational Swings\n\nChina, still the top overseas market, was heavily weighted by one movie: Ne Zha 2. The animated sensation released locally in late January and went on to become the highest-grossing title in the market’s history at 15.44B RMB ($2.2B+) as well as the biggest movie of the year worldwide and the No. 5 movie ever globally.\n\nRELATED: The 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\nChina’s final box office for 2025 is estimated at roughly 51.8B RMB ($7.4B), per Maoyan, a more than 20% increase on 2024, though nearly 30% of grosses were from just that one film. Most agree that the market struggled in 2025, getting a boost of adrenaline from Disney’s Zootopia 2 in November, with Maoyan noting repeat viewings and “fan engagement and loyalty.” While Hollywood doesn’t really expect China to return to the pre-pandemic heyday, Zootopia demonstrated that audiences will turn out for event films and franchises for which they have an affinity.\n\nLocal midrange Chinese films saw a notable decline in numbers, “underscoring the market’s increasing concentration on blockbuster projects,” Maoyan said. However, the traditional “blockbuster model is no longer a guaranteed formula for box office success,” it cautioned.\n\nOf the Top 10 international markets, Japan, at No. 2, was a standout with a roughly 35% increase over 2024 in local currency and up 33% in U.S. dollars, according to comScore figures through December 28. This was amid the success of Demon Slayer, Kokuho, the latest Detective Conan, Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reze Arc and Zootopia 2.\n\nRELATED: From James Gray, Ruben Östlund & Paweł Pawlikowski To Iñárritu’s Tom Cruise-Starrer, ‘Cliff Booth’ & Judith Godrèche’s Directorial Debut: 79 Films That Could Light Up Festivals In 202\n\nIndeed, anime really spread its wings in 2025, including Demon Slayer and Chainsaw Man. This is a growing medium that is expanding globally and resonates with an underserved audience while also drawing new customers — there was so much heat around these movies that they became must-sees in all regions.\n\nIn the UK, the No. 3 market internationally, Uni’s Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy was huge, becoming the No. 3 movie of the year there with about $63M, whereas it went straight to Peacock in the U.S. It was a smart bet to release it theatrically overseas, particularly in the UK. Overall, the market essentially was flat with 2024, up a slight 2% in U.S. dollars.\n\nAt No. 4 on the international chart, France’s cinema admissions dropped 13.6% year-on-year in 2025, for a rough gross of $1.36B, according to figures released by France’s National Cinema Center. A lack of local drivers compared to last year was part of the issue.\n\nRELATED: Casting Conundrums: From Bond To Voldemort, Doctor Who To ‘White Lotus’, The Biggest Movie & TV Roles To Be Filled In 2026\n\nAnd the No. 5 market, Germany, was up 6% in local currency (+10% in U.S. dollars). Whereas 2024’s Top 5 movies were Hollywood titles, the No. 1 movie in the market in 2025, per comScore, was Das Kanu des Manitu (Manitou’s Canoe).\n\nWindows\n\nAlthough it has improved to a degree, France still has a fairly arcane windowing system. But globally, windows are on everyone’s minds, an issue which Deadline’s Anthony D’Alessandro already has written about extensively.\n\nInternationally, some execs contend that it’s not always a one-size-fits-all approach because habits are different in myriad overseas markets. Said one: “Habits, good or bad, can change within weeks, and when they do, they can settle in as the new normal. The new windowing patterns have changed the audience’s habit from going to ‘The Movies’ to going to ‘A Movie.’ International markets have had varying degrees of impact from this.”\n\nAlso stressed by an international exec is that the impact of shorter, inconsistent windowing ultimately is what has negatively changed audience moviegoing habits, putting the impetus on every movie to create a cultural moment. If, for whatever reason, audiences don’t go to the cinema on opening weekend, their mindset shifts, focusing on the conveniences of home viewing with the assumption that the movie will be imminently available, doing so with little knowledge of when each movie actually will be available outside cinemas.\n\nRELATED: 2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More\n\nYet another international distribution maven said: “Windowing has always been a hot button in the industry, but windowing is not a bad thing. … Part of the issue is that the intense competition has increased the price of content. So how do you maximize the gross? And when we talk about windows, what we don’t do adequately is talk about what the consumer wants. … We have to make those decisions in a way that’s smart.”\n\nOne person, however, took issue with exhibition already accepting Netflix movies on a condensed run. “I don’t understand why a lot of these exhibitors around the world are playing Netflix content on these short windows. Windows are important to protect the theatrical experience, and they need to think about the long-term health of the business. I don’t think you can have it both ways.”\n\nProblem Areas\n\nAsia remains a concern for the studios, with some markets losing per-capita moviegoing and Korea notably suffering amid lots of in-home competition from local series. In 2024, four of the Top 5 films in the market were local, while in 2025, only one was Korean.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, local product tends to be working better — think Indonesia and its horror titles. For Hollywood, however, we’re told that some markets are still off more than 50% from 2019. Said an international distribution exec: “We had a region that was in consistent growth for years, and then as soon as we came out of the pandemic, it went backwards fairly quickly. … Local-market audience tastes have changed. They’ve leaned into local filmmaking, which makes sense as those are relatable local stories.”\n\nRELATED: Horror Movies’ Next Wave: What’s Coming In 2026, From Auteur Nightmares To Indie Breakouts\n\nThe studios and local exhibition are working together to try and reverse this downward trend as everyone is striving toward a healthier overall market.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSome folks wonder about continuing to leverage popular IP in a surprising way. It’s key to deliver content that is relevant but also to take swings. When it comes to international, it can be a challenge to have product that resonates across a multitude of markets. Choice and more volume also are necessary, as are the collaboration between studios and exhibitors and spreading out the calendar.\n\nAs noted above, audiences still come out for the big blockbusters, but there were some disappointments, particularly for superhero films. 2025 was the first year since 2020 that the Top 10 worldwide chart did not include a Marvel title. WB/DC’s Superman did rank No. 10 but skewed heavily domestic. Upcoming this year, there’s plenty of reason to hope Spider-Man: Brand New Day and Avengers: Doomsday will perform strongly around the world.\n\nAlthough it’s expensive and logistically challenging, we saw more talent travel internationally in 2025, and that can pay dividends as it brings the audience in on the experience and drives awareness and want-to-see.\n\nAn annual refrain in the post-pandemic years has been that the industry could do a better job of spreading some of the wealth across 12 months so there are no significant fallow periods.\n\nRELATED: 35 Of The Most Anticipated Movies Of 2026\n\nWhile there’s a lot of content in summer, 2026’s Q1 does look better leveled out including Sony’s 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple and Amazon MGM’s Mercy in January; WB’s Wuthering Heights,Sony’s GOAT and Paramount’s Scream 7 in February; then Amazon MGM’s Ryan Gosling starrer Project Hail Mary and Disney’s Hoppers in March.\n\nThe rest of the year is well-stacked.\n\nLook for Universal/Illumination’s The Super Mario Galaxy Movie and Lionsgate’s Michael (which Universal has internationally) to light up April; followed by Disney’s The Devil Wears Prada 2 and Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu in May. The next month marks the return of Steven Spielberg with Disclosure Day from Uni, then Dis/Pixar’s Toy Story 5 and WB/DC’s Supergirl. July trots out Uni/Illumination’s Minions 3, then Dis’ live-action Moana and Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey from Uni — and at the end of the month, Spidey swings in with Brand New Day from Sony/Marvel. August gets Par’s PAW Patrol: The Dino Movie and Blumhouse/Sony’s Insidious: The Bleeding World. September brings a new Resident Evil from Sony and WB’s Practical Magic 2. In October, Tom Cruise no doubt will be out in support of Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Digger from WB. November rhymes in with WB’s The Cat in the Hat, then Lionsgate’s The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping and Par’s Focker-In-Law. The year closes out with Sony’s Jumanji 3, WB/Legendary’s Dune: Part Three and Disney/Marvel’s Avengers: Doomsday in December.\n\nAnd that’s just the major titles — there’s a lot to look forward to from Hollywood in 26.

Based on some of this year’s buzziest films, that question is on the minds of contemporary directors and writers.\n\nFrom the postpartum loneliness and depression that many mothers face depicted in Lynne Ramsay’s “Die My Love,” the multi-generational fight for meaningful change in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” to the never-ending economic stresses placed on family in Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice,” many of this year’s films take an unflinching look at the anxiety parents — and, in turn, their children — face in today’s increasingly politically volatile world.\n\nIn appreciating the links between these different stories, “Train Dreams” director and co-writer Clint Bentley says: “The world, for most of us, feels like it’s turning on its axis a bit. Whether we live in Des Moines or Dubai, we feel like the world is changing in a way we can’t quite understand, and that there might be a kind of end-of-the-world feeling even as we’re all going on. Part of that is through, ‘What do I give to the next generation? How do I take care of my kids and give them something when everything seems like it’s fucked up, and that we all kind of fucked it up?’”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn tackling grief, Oscar winner Chloé Zhao’s (“Nomadland”) period piece “Hamnet” explores how the death of William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) and Agnes Shakespeare’s (Jessie Buckley) son led to the creation of the much-studied play “Hamlet.” When author and co-writer Maggie O’Farrell, herself a student of English literature, read large Shakespeare biographies, she found herself “really angered” at scholars who claimed it was “impossible” to know whether the revered playwright grieved or not.\n\n“I threw the book across the room because you just think, ‘What are you talking about? Of course he grieved.’ And even if child mortality was high in the 16th century, which of course it was, it doesn’t make it any less devastating when your child dies,” O’Farrell says. “I refuse to believe that anywhere in the world at any point in time, it’s anything less than catastrophic to lose a child. In a way, I wanted to put Hamnet center stage and say to people, ‘We owe this child so much.’”\n\nBeyond some of the film’s brutally devastating scenes, which feature Agnes fighting to cure her children of the plague, Zhao and O’Farrell tap into how art can serve as a transcendent, cathartic force, as Shakespeare’s writing ensures Hamnet isn’t forgotten. O’Farrell says: “That’s why the line ‘Remember me,’ which the book ends with, has always been very important because I just wonder if that’s why Shakespeare wrote it. But obviously, Agnes and him had no idea for how many hundreds of years Hamnet would [actually] be remembered.”\n\n“Train Dreams,” which follows the life of an ordinary man (Joel Edgerton) in the early 20th century across the Pacific Northwest, serves as a great companion piece to “Hamnet” for its meditative exploration of grief. However, Bentley also wrestles with “the real tragedy” of parents having to spend long periods of time away for work: “You’re always kind of catching up and just when it feels you’re getting used to being back home, you’re leaving again. A lot of people experience that whether you’re a filmmaker, truck driver or somebody needing to leave their country.”\n\nSome directors, including Cherien Dabis, found the process of making their films cathartic and inspirational in their own right. For Dabis, writing, directing and acting in “All That’s Left of You,” a decades-spanning personal tale of a Palestinian family’s fight for survival, became a way to understand her own intergenerational trauma.\n\n“I definitely wanted to draw attention to the struggles of families under occupation, but especially parents who don’t really have the ability to protect their kids anymore,” Dabis says. “Often, what we see in Palestine is kids who, at some point, realize, ‘Well, my parents can’t protect me, so what use are they?’ It’s like parents lose all authority. I think that’s a problem; that’s something that we need to take a look at.”\n\nThe film, which is Jordan’s Oscar entry for Best International Feature, also deals with the loss of childhood innocence, as the young child Noor watches his father being stripped naked by Israeli soldiers. The father-son relationship quickly deteriorates in the years following the humiliation, and the scene was inspired by Dabis’ own experience — her first memory of traveling to Palestine.\n\n“My family was held at the border between Jordan and the West Bank for 12 hours; my parents were interrogated multiple times. The soldiers searched through all the contents of our suitcases and then ordered all of us to be strip searched, including myself and my baby sisters, who were age three and one,” Dabis recalls. “It was one of the first moments in my life where I really understood, viscerally, what it meant to be Palestinian.”\n\nIn varying ways, political pressures around the world have found their way into these films. Bentley, himself a father, explains how parents have to reckon with not just what it means to bring a child into the world, but how to prepare them for its realities: “[For example], how do I prepare them for the fact that it’s going to be hard to find a job with AI taking everything over? What do you do? The powerlessness of a parent really feeds into that.”\n\nAs many of these directors have traveled around the world with their films — both “Train Dreams” and “All That’s Left of You” started their campaigns at Sundance, and “Hamnet” bowed in Telluride and Toronto — they’ve realized how universal these stories can be in their specificity.\n\n“I’m always so excited when it feels like there’s something in the zeitgeist and filmmakers are capturing it. They’ve come together and made films at a similar moment in time, therefore creating a cultural dialogue — it’s almost proof that we’re all connected somehow,” Dabis says. “Even prior to this year, there have been trends toward really talking honestly and openly about motherhood in a way that empowers women.”\n\nTo unpack the unspoken pressures of motherhood, Mary Bronstein’s anxiety-including “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” situates the viewer in the subjective experience of one mother’s (Rose Byrne) life as she struggles to care for her child suffering from a mysterious illness. What’s inventive about the craft, here, is Bronstein choosing to have the child’s face be off-screen for most of the runtime, allowing the sound design to put viewers on edge.\n\n“I couldn’t think of another film that really reflected the feelings and experience I was having that got into the existential confusion of identity,” Bronstein says. “My film can be abstracted out to the feeling of disappearing into a care-taking role and how to hold onto your identity. Can you be an individual and a mother at the same time?”\n\nWhile Bronstein has received positive feedback from mothers feeling seen for the first time watching the film, especially in today’s climate with rights for women being taken away, what has pleasantly surprised her is hearing from young people who are finally understanding what their mother went through in raising them.\n\n“It can feel like a betrayal to the love of your child, and what I’m expressing in the movie is that it’s not. We should be able to talk about these difficult things and the loss of identity that women feel, and the scary parts of being in charge of another living human,” she says. “For women, there’s a freedom in seeing somebody finally express that to you.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:35:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T23:42:22.771741"}

He described his stepfather, John Cederquist, as “humorless.” Chase’s half-brother, also named John Cederquist, said, “My father had a flash anger, and he could lash out with a single blow…He did not take to anything that he perceived as insolence. Chevy was insolent.”\n\nChase’s wife, Jayni, said the first time she stayed overnight with Chase and woke him up, he “shuddered.” “He explained, ‘Well, my mother would wake me up slapping me.’ From the time he was a little guy, wham!” she said.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nChase’s mother, Cathalene Browning, is described in the documentary as “a bag of cats, certainly on the schizoid spectrum.”\n\n“This was an out-of-control woman who I look back on and I say I feel sorry for her,” Chase said. “She had her own issues — bad ones. But, she was physically abusive to me.”\n\nPeter Aaron, a friend of the comedian’s, said Chase told him stories about the “terrible things that would happen to him as a young man — things like being locked in the closet.” Chase’s brother, Ned, added, “There was a cellar, and he was sent down there because of really messing up in school.”\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times published Friday, Chase alluded to being “slapped with a yardstick on your bare ass and on the backs of your legs until they’re so bruised that somebody else notices.”\n\nChase would get punished for receiving poor grades in school, but, ironically, he said he was failing academically because of the abuse. “Whereas others would concentrate on their homework, I didn’t have a chance at that,” he said. “I was always worried about one thing or another that had to do with my own health.”\n\nChase detailed one incident in which he and Ned were eating breakfast, and their stepfather came downstairs “and started slapping me across the back of the head.” Ned recalled, “I stood up and made it clear I didn’t think this was a time for corporal punishment.

It continues to this day,” said Emily Chase, his youngest daughter. “He will joke around from morning until night, and you won’t know what’s going on. … That’s how he always dealt with problems in his life.”\n\n“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” is now available to watch on CNN’s streaming platforms.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-02T23:42:23.070760"}

But this award season is full of films with mothers who make decisions and sacrifices that will be debated well beyond WhatsApp chats, school drop offs and personal therapy sessions.\n\nIs the decision that Teyana Taylor’s “One Battle After Another” revolutionary activist Perfidia Beverly Hills makes to go on the lam and abandon her young child an act of selfishness and self-preservation? Or is it a means of saving her daughter from the dangers of growing up with her, someone who regrets becoming a parent? Is it right for “Sinners’” Grace (Li Jun Li) to sacrifice the last surviving humans at a juke joint to a swarm of vampires if it means she may be able to save the child she has back at home? Is Rose Byrne’s Linda in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” acting on the best interest of her daughter’s medical care? Or is she burned out and drowning in the exhaustiveness of feeding tubes, doctor’s appointments and everything else life throws at her?\n\nMary Bronstein, who wrote and directed “Legs” based on her own experiences (and who appears in the film as a doctor unsympathetic to Linda’s plight), says that “there’s a fantasy fulfillment” to her film; that she couldn’t speak out in parenting support sessions or leave her child at a hotel unsupervised… but Linda can.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“When you have a child with special needs, or when you’re in a crisis situation with your child, everybody is placating you and trying to make you feel better by saying, ‘It’s not your fault,’” she says.\n\nShe describes these feelings as both confusing and guilt-inducing because “you’re also positioned as the main person that’s in charge of helping your child.”\n\nTold from Linda’s point of view, “Legs” shows a caretaker unraveling. The disorder the character’s daughter has is deliberately never named. Bronstein says that choice was made because, if it was named, then it becomes a movie “about a specific illness that a mother is trying to fix or find a cure for.” The daughter’s face is also hidden for most of the movie, and much screentime is fixated on Linda, with her increasingly greasy hair and dark shadows under her eyes. Bronstein also added the sly twist that Linda is a therapist, meaning her entire world is supposed to be about caring for other people.\n\n“A big part of this movie centers on the trauma that Linda is experiencing, that Linda holds within her body,” Bronstein says. “The trauma of different things that have happened with the daughter, those are things that she has hidden away in the back of her mind. And one very major one reveals itself to her and slaps her in the face.”\n\nBronstein says that “with trauma, I believe that you do hold it in your body somewhere and, if you don’t deal with it, it’s going to get you at some point. And you can’t run away from it, because it’s not external; it’s internal.”\n\nWhatever audiences might think of Linda and her decisions, the concept of parental trauma is also seen on film this year in mothers who adhere closer to the textbook definition of “good” parents. Jessie Buckley’s Agnes in “Hamnet” is angry at herself as much as she is guilt-ridden that she couldn’t save one child because she was so fixated on protecting another. Kate Hudson’s wounded musician Claire in “Song Sung Blue” can only see to help her daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) after she puts on her own oxygen mask and gets sober. “KPop Demon Hunters’” Celine (Yunjin Kim) teaches her adoptive daughter to feel shame and hide her true self rather than discuss her otherness.\n\nIn director Eric Lin and screenwriter Marilyn Fu’s “Rosemead,” which is based on a true story covered in a 2017 Los Angeles Times piece, Lucy Liu’s Irene must weigh how her own terminal cancer diagnosis will impact her teenage son Joe’s (Lawrence Shou) newly diagnosed schizophrenia. Coping with all of this, as well as the recent loss of her husband to cancer and cultural stigmas toward therapy, Western medicine and mental disorders, Irene uses stoicism to hide her own fears. She both supports her son by joining him in his therapy sessions, even if they make her uncomfortable, and attempts to protect him from ostracization within the community by lying about why he’s there when he’s seen going into these sessions.\n\n“I think there’s a shame behind it [and] I don’t think it’s just solely the Asian community,” she says of reaction to Joe’s diagnosis and treatment. “It’s a stigma that everyone holds that therapy is for someone who really has a problem, and nobody wants to be known as somebody who has a problem or an issue.”\n\nThe reality, she continues, “is that we all have to process something that happens to us, whether it’s severe or not.”\n\nIn fact, the movie centers so much on Irene’s dedication and concern for her son that it’s easy to forget just how sick she is until her doctor gives her the final diagnosis.\n\nLiu thinks Irene’s grief over the loss of her husband plus “the secrecy and the hiding and the stories she made up to try to fit into society, and to also make sure that her son was not sequestered from the community or from other kids … that struggle already was so difficult on top of the physical illness that she was experiencing.”\n\n“The corporal body was weak, but her inner willpower and her courage and her love for her son was really strong,” Liu says. “That dynamic tension [and] that urgency sort of fills the time on screen. Her personality comes through with the urgency of trying to save her son because she’s losing her son even though he’s right there in the house.”\n\nThe movie ends with Irene making the only decision she deems possible, a parental act of both love and fear.\n\n“It’s definitely going to spark conversation, and it should really create a comfortable, safe place for discussion and reaction because it is such a powerful moment of choice for her,” Liu says of the finale. “It’s obviously not for everyone, but it’s a haunting reality that that if it weren’t true, nobody would believe it. I think the legacy that she left behind is something to hold up in our community and others to say that things can become like this if you don’t take these simple steps.”\n\nLiu says that parents are taught to be present and work with their children in their current situations, but they also inevitably “futurize or try to live in another fantasy world.” She says she thinks Irene’s decision is “symbolic of how lonely she was and how isolated she was, and how real it was to her.”\n\nShe doesn’t know if her own family has experiences with mental disorders, saying, “I don’t know enough about my history because there has been so much secrecy in our own family.” But she says she has seen in society that “everyone wants to solve the puzzle — and it’s not a puzzle to be solved. It’s a puzzle to be lived. And that’s something that people just don’t want to believe because they’re not really living it the way that you are.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:45:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T02:01:03.122783"}

According to CBS News, what had formerly been a “38-page handbook” is now “5 simple values.”\n\nDokoupil was appointed to the anchor chair of “CBS Evening News” last month by Weiss, the editor in chief of CBS News and founder of The Free Press, which describes itself as “a new media company built on the ideals that were once the bedrock of American journalism.” Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison acquired The Free Press in a reported $150 million deal and installed Weiss to oversee CBS News’ editorial operations in what he said was an effort to restore viewers’ trust in the outlet.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“When the new ‘CBS Evening News’ kicks off on Monday, we promise to live by these five simple principles – from our very first show on the road, to our first broadcast on the new set in New York, and every one after that,” the show said in a series of posts on social media.\n\nOne of the principles outlined by “CBS Evening News” was this: “We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so. Our foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth.” The news show said that “We aim to do our part every night: One way to think about our show is as a daily conversation about exactly where we are as a country and where we are going.”\n\nOn Thursday, Jan. 1, Dokoupil shared his thoughts on the state of journalism in the U.S. ahead of his taking over as “CBS Evening News” anchor.\n\n“People do not trust us like they used to,” Dokoupil said in a video shared on CBSNews.com. He continued: “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or, we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\nHere are the “five simple principles” that “CBS Evening News” says it will be guided by with Dokoupil as the anchor:\n\nWe work for you. That means you come first. Not our advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests, including the corporate owners of CBS News. We report on the world as it is. We’ll be honest and direct with you. That means no weasel words or padded landings. We’ll tell you what we know, when we know it. Well update our reporting when we uncover new facts. And we’ll admit when we get it wrong. We respect you. We believe that our fellow Americans are smart and discerning. It’s our job to present you with the fullest picture — and the strongest voices on all sides of an issue. We trust you to make up your own minds, and to make the decisions that are best for you, your families and your communities. We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so. Our foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth. We also believe in Franklin’s famous line about America as a republic — if we can keep it. We aim to do our part every night: One way to think about our show is as a daily conversation about exactly where we are as a country and where we are going. We respect tradition, but we also believe in the future. We embrace the tools that allow us to reach you where you are. Some of you will watch this show on linear television. Others will increasingly watch it on social media. What we can guarantee is that the tools will continue to change — but some things never will.

And the tale is even more complicated than virtually anyone would have thought.\n\nWhy? Not only because of the challenges in clearing the songs with the Prince estate — but because of the show’s plot: The two songs required for that segment of the show had to be the first and last songs on one side of a single vinyl album, which, to use a reference from the show, is like a Rubik’s Cube for the music supervisor, and much more challenging than selecting Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill,” Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” or any of the show’s many other iconic music moments.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe hard work paid off: Since the episode debuted on New Year’s Eve, “Purple Rain” has seen a 243 percent increase in Spotify global streams and a 577 percent surge in global Gen-Z streams specifically, Variety can exclusively reveal. “When Doves Cry” also saw a 200 percent boost in global streams, as well as a 128 percent increase in Gen Z streams.\n\nAnd as you’ll see below, Nora Felder, president of Picture Music Company and a veteran music supervisor who has been on board for the entirety of “Stranger Things,” was more than up to the task — which doesn’t mean it was easy! Variety caught up with Felder on Friday afternoon to find out how she got it done …\n\nDid you do anything special for the finale?\n\nYes, I saw it in a theater with my family — I’ve never seen “Stranger Things” like that, with an audience. It was the first time I was able to really experience how they’re so emotionally attached to the characters — they were cheering and shrieking, some of them were crying. I can’t think of another way I would rather have seen it.\n\nI think the music in the show does so well because it stems from the fans being so attached to the characters and the stories, and the music extends their journeys, so they naturally become attached to it as well.\n\nMusic plays a bigger role in “Stranger Things” than a lot of similar episodic shows or films. Was that intentional from the jump?\n\nI think the intention was just to find songs to push the narrative of the story, and rolling up our sleeves and keying in on “What is the right song for this character?” and “What is the right song for each moment? Should this be score or a song?” I can’t speak on behalf of the Duffers, but I don’t think there was an overall sense of “We’re going to create something that’s going to make music such a main character that it’s going to blow up all over their world!” No, they just wanted songs that accented their characters, pushed the narrative, and showed the attachment of music to the characters — and how music can sometimes save you.\n\nDid we know the Clash was going to have a moment? Or Kate Bush or Metallica, or possibly what’s going on now? No, it’s always been about what is the most effective choice to either move this narrative or represent the true essence of this character. And I think that because we always constantly stayed true to that, the show became what it was.\n\nThose two Prince songs were a surprise, and I’m sure it was a challenge clearing them. Why those songs? And how do you think they spoke to those moments in the show?\n\nI’m glad you say “do you think” because songs can be interpreted in so many different ways. But they came about in a similar way to Kate Bush and “Running Up That Hill”: They were not scripted. They were “TBD” moments in the two spots in the script where a song needed to play: [SPOILER ALERT] for the scene when Hopper and Murray set off the bomb detonation to collapse the Upside Down gate, which was set off from the record player. So it needed to be the first song from one side of a [vinyl album], and then it needed to segue to the last song on that same side of the [same album], to play through Eleven’s emotional stand against that leads into the collapsing dimension of the Upside Down. So they needed to hit those two spots.\n\nThe Duffers reached out to me about this before the scene was shot — I didn’t even have a shooting schedule, I think they had just written the script and only the cast had seen it. They’d been going through songs, I think they were asking for ideas from the cast. And they said, “This one is a little more tricky because of the way the scenes are going to be set up: We need something preferably from 1987 — but it could be from before — the songs have to be from the same artist; and the first song has to start the A or B-side of an album by that artist, and the second song has to end the A or B side of that album.\n\nThat is an incredibly narrow window!\n\nExactly! So my heart stopped, like, ooh, that’s a tough one. And remember, the scene’s not shot yet, so I haven’t seen the footage and this is just me imagining it in my head — and it’s got to play through this big, emotional, sad scene that’ll lead into a dimension collapsing! I’ve been doing this for 20 years, but there’s still always a first.\n\nObviously I have various ways of finding music: Sometimes songs just pop into my head — and I know the ‘80s quite well — sometimes it’s just e-surfing, Spotify or streaming this or that; sometimes it’s just driving in a car and somebody drives by with a song playing; and I also have 15,000 or 20,000 CDs and albums. But for this one, I needed to go to my research books. I found a couple that listed the albums [by side], and I literally had to go and flip through the book for ideas and then see if the first and last tracks on a side could line up to our needs. And in a lot of cases, they just didn’t. I mean, I stayed up all night, and I think I came up with just two ideas.\n\nJust to step away from Prince for a second, in these situations, I like to give the Duffers a lot of different flavors to choose from to find what works best. Like in the scene where [SPOILER ALERT] Karen is fighting the monster to save Holly, I tried all kinds of songs, from Frank Sinatra to you name it, and they fell in love with the ABBA song, “Fernando,” which was actually the first song I sent them.\n\nSo what was the other album you sent them, along with Prince’s “Purple Rain”?\n\nPart of me doesn’t want to say what it is, because I don’t want people to feel bad. But I did send a classic artist from the ‘70s, big artists, and I said, “We could end it with this, but I’m not sure about the starting song — and honestly, I don’t even know if those guys will clear it, and it’s going to cost megabucks.”\n\nOr, I said, “We could end it with ‘Purple Rain’ and start with ‘When Doves Cry’ — but honestly, I don’t even know if I can clear it.” I mean, I had not heard of [“Purple Rain”] clearing before, although I know now that it did clear for something right after Prince died [in 2016] — there was a relationship with someone who did a [“Black-ish”] series episode about a character mourning Prince’s death, but that was a one-off situation.\n\nSo the Duffers wrote back to me and said, “Do you think we could get this cleared?” And I’m like gulp, “I’m really not sure, but I’d be willing to try.” And they said, let’s try. Double gulp! Because this means they really want it — they weren’t having me clear anything else.\n\nThe good news is, I majored in English in college, and that helped with creating what I call “theses”: where you give the rights owners all the information of how the song’s going to be used, and the backstory of it, the meaning of it — Jennifer Barron, my clearance coordinator, and I went deep on this one. So we spoke to Marty Silverstone at Primary Wave. He goes, “Well, we all know it’s a tough one, but let’s try.” I said, “If there’s anything that they might clear it for, it would be ‘Stranger Things,’ right?” He goes, “Let’s hope!,” because the estate has so many approvals.\n\nThen I talked to Joy Murphy at Universal Music Publishing [which administers the songs’ publishing], and she said the same thing — “Nora, let’s give it a try, we’ll do everything we can to position this in the right way.” So that was two. Then I had Thuy Lam at Warner Records — which controls the master [recording] — who I’d been down this road before with Kate Bush, and she said, “We support this.” And then we waited — that was grueling, and it took a few weeks — we were getting closer to shooting and so the Duffers made a plan to shoot the scenes in a way where the song could be added later. But shortly after that, I got the answer that [the Prince tracks were approved.]\n\nNow, I know the Duffers feel that Prince’s estate cleared the songs because of Kate Bush, and I’m sure that had something to do with it, as the parties reminded them of the impact the show had with “Running Up That Hill.” And I did tell them I thought this was going to be one of the most significant moments in the season, although no one has a crystall ball. But still, for the rights owners, it’s not just about the money, it’s about what lines up with what Prince would have wanted, and to do it in the most respectful manner possible. And I don’t want to discount all the hard work we put into the “theses,” making sure everyone fully understood these uses and what they meant to the characters.\n\nFor “Running Up That Hill,” though, there were hundreds of other songs that could have worked, you didn’t need songs that began and ended an album side.\n\nYeah, for [the Kate Bush slot], I had 9 or 10 other songs in my pocket — but I said, “This is the best one. This does everything we want it to do.” I don’t think it could have been [as good with] anything else — because the lyrical content lined up so perfectly with what the characters were going through and needed to do. You know, they needed to step outside of their own world and step into someone else’s shoes to truly understand and reconnect. I’m not saying we couldn’t have gotten something else, but I don’t know if it would have lined up as perfectly, not only with the melodic structure in the building, but also with the intricate message that seemed to speak on a deeper level and relate to our characters.\n\nAlso, those two Prince songs are so heavily associated with the “Purple Rain” film and the emotions and visuals that go with it — was that a concern?\n\nNo, not for me, and the Duffers never mentioned that. We’ve never been against using songs that have been tied to other stories because this is a completely different, unique story. And again, going back to the special relationship that the fans have with this show, once you attach it to their characters and this story, it’s almost as if it takes on a different meaning. And remember, a lot of the young people are not going to have that association. Even the older people that knew and grew up with these songs, they’re listening to it in a different way.\n\nThey kind of line up in that way as well, because “Purple Rain” is obviously the climax of that film, and here it’s part of the climax.\n\nYeah, when things are beginning to be resolved and [SPOILER ALERT] Eleven has made her decision that she needs to cease existing in order to save them. And “When Doves Cry” — doves have always represented love and peace, right? And in this case, they’re crying because they’re sorrowful — if we want to get heavy here, and pretend we just smoked some pot together (laughter).\n\nBut from what I’ve always understood, the song is about the conflicts that exist within relationships, right? So to me, it was interesting to put the song in that spot, because they’re feeling hopeful, but things aren’t resolved — their mission is not done; there’s still people in danger; the world is not one. So even though the song has a kind of a lightness to it, I think that’s why it worked well. And “Purple Rain” has always symbolized the chaotic, sad world that we live in, but it’s also ultimately about redemption, love, and transformation.\n\n[Marty Silverstone, President of Global Sync at Primary Wave Music, tells Variety: “We’re thrilled that we could play a part in bringing these very special uses to life and have Prince’s music included in the phenomenon that is ‘Stranger Things.’ You have to admire the unique connection the show has with its fanbase, its brilliant music curation over its entire run, and its spotlight on the cosmic importance of music in the lives of young people, and all people!”]\n\nOK, can I guess the other one you considered? Led Zeppelin? The Eagles?\n\nNo, it wasn’t the Eagles. And I’m not going to say Led Zeppelin didn’t come up — I tried Led Zeppelin, but it didn’t work because I was thinking “Stairway to Heaven” and it wasn’t a first [song on album side] and a last situation. And I thought maybe Pink Floyd with “The Wall,” but I can’t remember if the right song was an ending or not. I don’t know how many times I went through this: One song would work and the other one wouldn’t. I mean, that’s why I stayed up all night with my books!\n\nAre you having separation anxiety now that the show is over?\n\nI’m sad, but I’m about to go into “Yellowjackets” right now, literally on Monday. And I love that show. And I’m working on the Duffer Brothers’ other project that they’re executive-producing, “The Boroughs,” that’s coming out this year. And then we’ll see about after that!

One person he encounters advises him to “heed the warnings of those before you, so your fate can be different.” And thus this [&#8230;]", "content": "Clay, the lead character in “The Dutchman,” is having a hellish night in New York City, the kind of night that could end his life or change it in gravely material ways. One person he encounters advises him to “heed the warnings of those before you, so your fate can be different.” And thus this adaptation of Amiri Baraka’s celebrated 1964 play, “Dutchman,” about race and Black identity, announces its intention to offer an alternate, updated interpretation of a seminal text. The film adds modern references and takes place in the present, but its treatment of the play’s themes remains murky and marred by an inability to let go of what director Andre Gaines evidently considers to be a sacred text.\n\nThe adaptation, which Gaines wrote with Qasim Basir, begins in a marriage therapy session. Clay (André Holland), a successful Black businessman, is trying to understand why his wife Kaya (Zazie Beetz) cheated on him, though he seems defensive and unable to open up emotionally. The therapist (Stephen McKinley Henderson) urges him to listen to his wife. Despite the palpable tension between the spouses, their commitment and love is apparent. They are not on their way to separation, but perhaps to a greater understanding of one another’s needs.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOn his way to a Harlem fundraiser for a friend running for office (Aldis Hodge), Clay encounters a strange white woman on the train. From the moment she sets her eyes on him, Lula (Kate Mara) seems determined to shock, seduce, taunt and repel Clay. One minute, she invites him to her bed, and the next, she’s threatening to call “rape.” She insists on accompanying him to the party where she’s determined to cause a ruckus and upend his relationships with his wife, friends and community. What is driving her fixation on Clay is never explained.\n\nIn Baraka’s play, Clay and Lula serve as allegorical representations of Black assimilation and white supremacy, respectively. Written and performed at the height of the Civil Rights movement, “Dutchman” was audacious and ahead of its time. Its provocative themes and the visceral ways in which it dealt with them challenged audiences. In trying to open it up for a 2026 audience, Gaines and Basir add dimension to Clay, while leaving Lula little more than a mechanism of confrontation. That imbalance — one main character rendered flesh and blood while the other never comes to life — hinders the central narrative of the film.\n\nThe play takes place on a subway train, and though that remains a pivotal setting, Gaines’ opens up the drama, situating Clay and Lula within a broader social landscape, reinforcing the idea that their encounter is not isolated but embedded in the violence of New York City. His framing of their scenes together, whether on the train, in her apartment or within a large party full of people, allows the actors to play well off each other.\n\nStrangely, “Dutchman” is overtly referenced multiple times in the script. Clay is given a printed version of the play by his therapist early on. He is shown a miniature version of a theater where his “character” appears as a small toy to be manipulated. He catches a glimpse of a TV production playing on the display window of an electronics store as he’s walking around with Lula.\n\nHenderson plays several roles and keeps appearing as specter throughout the proceedings to comment and call back to the play. His character is sometimes referred to as Amiri and quotes directly from the play and from other well-known texts about American Black identity. This meta incorporation of the play adds a sense of déjà vu to the film, suggesting that what’s happening to Clay could be a rite of passage that every Black man must face in this country.\n\nGaines and Basir’s adaptation adheres to the play’s intellectual origins. However, they never manage to make the story emotional, maintaining its themes without modernizing them. Perhaps that’s the point: Contemporary African American men must constantly deal with their identities and the way white society sees them. If the reason for this adaptation is to continue that conversation for a new generation, then they have succeeded.\n\nHolland brings vivid shading to a role written as a symbol of his race and nationality, making him the main reason to watch this adaptation. He’s immediately believable as a man in love who is also hurting, as a man with desires he’d rather not acknowledge, and as an ambitious person who believes he deserves his success — all themes that the text hints at, and which Holland bring to life while matching intensity with vulnerability. In his last monologue, he adds notes of sarcasm to cover the righteous anger his character feels, giving the film the explosive ending it has been building toward, even it didn’t quite earn it.\n\n“The Dutchman” exists in a tense space between reverence and reinvention. It is an adaptation so aware of the power and legacy of Baraka’s text that it never fully trusts its own instincts. The result is a film that provokes thought more than feeling, one that invites discussion, while denying audiences the emotional dimension that might have driven home its relevance.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 03:07:27 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T03:40:03.495373"}

The image presents Rebecca in an unraveled state, suggesting a character navigating vulnerability while maintaining an instinct for authority and survival.\n\nSutaria made her film debut with “Student of the Year 2” in 2019, winning the Zee Cine Award for Best Female Debut. Her subsequent work has included action films “Marjaavaan,” “Heropanti 2” and “Ek Villain Returns,” alongside the survival thriller “Apurva” in 2023, which critics noted offered her expanded dramatic range. “Toxic” marks her first pan-India production.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\n“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n“I’ve always felt an instinctive love to protect Tara. Perhaps because she is a guarded soul or perhaps it’s the armor she’s comfortable with. And perhaps it doesn’t need to be defined,” said Mohandas. “I realized early on that the best way to reach her was not by pushing, not by demanding more, but by allowing her the space to simply be. That choice shaped our equation which turned out calm, deeply professional, and perfectly aligned. She observed more than she spoke. She listened more than she revealed. And I often wondered if I should guide her more closely. But in her silence, something powerful was brewing. When she finally stepped into her performance, what emerged was nothing short of breathtaking which is born from an inner understanding she carried all along. She surprised me completely, and in the most beautiful way. I have no doubt she will surprise everyone else too.”\n\nThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\nWritten by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic: A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has been shot simultaneously in Kannada and English, with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\nThe production features National Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer TP Abid.

And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHe continued, “And I know this because, at certain points, I have been you. I have felt this way too. I have felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn’t reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life. And that the most urgent questions simply weren’t being asked.”\n\nDokoupil’s message was met with a healthy dose of skepticism and some scorn — and he responded directly to several critics on his Instagram account, as highlighted by Guardian media reporter Jeremy Barr.\n\nOne commenter wrote, “I grew up on Cronkite. Too bad CBS has lost its Tiffany shine. But good luck to you anyway.” Dokoupil responded, “What did you love most about him? I can promise you we’ll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or any one else of his era.”\n\nDon Dahler, a journalist who is a former CBS News correspondent, posted, “Tony, you know I have enormous respect and affection for you. I know you’re a solid journalist and legitimate heir to the big desk at CBS-News. But this sounds like it was written by Bari Weiss.” Dokoupil responded, “nope, I wrote it. I spent the first half of my career as a print journalist. If the Internet had never been invented, I probably still would be a print journalist. Writing is my first form.”\n\nBravo host Andy Cohen also commented on Dokoupil’s post: “Listening too much to experts? Wtf.” To that, Dokoupil replied, “Andy, I love ya. But can you really not think of any examples where academic advice turned out narrow or bad? I basically gave you a multiple-choice list. It’s possible you were living outside or above the issues I mention.”\n\nDokoupil in his post original post said viewers have questioned CBS News’ coverage of topics like “NAFTA or the Iraq War”; “Hillary Clinton’s emails or Russiagate”; and “more recently, COVID lockdowns, Hunter Biden’s laptop or the president’s fitness for office.”\n\nMeanwhile, another commenter wrote on Dokoupil’s post, “I have very little faith that this is true. We watched your company twist itself into a knot to make itself attractive to it’s [sic] new parent company. I doubt you will be permitted to share the news in an unbiased way. You will show stories of everyday Americans who fight against addiction, job loss, etc. but the policy decisions contributing to their plight will stay in the background. Call me doubting Thomas, show me that I’m wrong.” To that, Dokoupil responded: “Hey, I hear ya. They’re just words right now. But hold me to them.”\n\nOne of the most-liked comments on the Dokoupil New Year’s Day post was: “Too late… Bari Weiss has destroyed this network.” Another commenter wrote, “Absolutely fucking insane to basically say ‘we’re going to dumb this down because facts coming from academia are uncomfortable for you.'”\n\nDokoupil was appointed anchor of “CBS Evening News” last month by Weiss, the editor in chief of CBS News and founder of The Free Press. Paramount Skydance acquired The Free Press in a reported $150 million deal and installed Weiss to oversee CBS News’ editorial operations in what CEO David Ellison said was an effort to restore viewers’ trust in the outlet.\n\nOn Friday, “CBS Evening News” released “five simple principles” guiding its coverage. One of those, according to CBS News, is “We love America,” explaining that the country’s “foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth.”\n\nRELATED: CBS Evening News Says ‘We Love America’ Is Now One of Its Guiding Principles", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 13:15:29 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T13:33:18.860860"}

If I had to audition for a winter movie — nope.”\n\n\n\nFortunately, the temperatures should be balmy in January when she receives the Creative Impact in Breakthrough Performance Award at a special brunch Jan. 4 at the Palm Springs International Film Awards for her role in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another.” She plays Perfidia Beverly Hills, a member of a resistance group who gives birth to — then abandons — her daughter, Willa. Sixteen years later, Willa finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy that brings some of her mother’s old allies out of hiding. And Taylor is a force — driven, determined, sexy, smart. She more than holds her own opposite Oscar-winners Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn.\n\n\n\nThe two worked together to build the role. That included Perfidia’s battle with postpartum depression, something the mother of two understands personally. In fact, she improvised several lines about “the feeling of not feeling seen and not feeling beautiful, not feeling heard and just not being able for the baby to latch on.” She was grateful Anderson chose to include it. “I feel like it’s a topic that’s not spoken about enough. I was anxious and excited to start getting into those layers.”\n\n\n\nTaylor previously earned raves for her performance in the 2023 Sundance winner “A Thousand and One,” where she played another complicated mother who kidnaps her own child out of foster care. She has no qualms about taking on a role that some audience members might judge.\n\n\n\n“[Perfidia] makes decisions that we may not all agree with, but we can all agree on the fact that she’s unapologetically herself and stands 10 toes down on a lot of things that we probably wouldn’t have been able to do at one point,” she notes. “Especially as a woman, we’re told we’re too confident, we got to tone it down. Here we see this woman. It’s like ‘No, you won’t quiet me. You won’t set me down. I won’t play house with you.’”\n\n\n\nThe character is so fascinating and complex, Taylor wouldn’t hesitate to play her again. Noting that Perfidia disappears from the film for 16 years only to be heard from in a letter at the end, she would love to know more about her life. So she’s open to a sequel or a companion piece — suggest the “Perfidia Beverly Hills Expanded Universe,” and she says to tell Anderson: “He could have pulled a ‘Wicked!’ He could have shot all of it and broken it in two because it’s so much story.” She even suggests making a spinoff utilizing footage that didn’t make the final cut and new scenes. “You could literally merge the other pieces, get a few new scenes with me — and then drop it, drop it like a mixtape!”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T16:34:49.390552"}

However, we are also forecasting that “Sinners,” the vampire-tinged epic will take home the most trophies with six including original screenplay for Coogler.\n\nMARTY SUPREME, Timothee Chalamet, 2025. © A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThe current expectation for the acting races suggest a strong night for a quartet of performances tied to four different films: Timothée Chalamet for “Marty Supreme,” Jessie Buckley for “Hamnet,” Benicio del Toro for “One Battle After Another” and Amy Madigan for “Weapons.” If that quartet holds, it would signal a more fluid and wide open race and reflecting broad enthusiasm across the top tier rather than turning the ceremony into a single-movie coronation.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nStill, the acting races are where the upsets tend to live. Best actor has two obvious alternatives with win-worthy narratives and passionate pockets of support: Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle” and Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon.” Best actress is similarly primed for a late surge, with Rose Byrne in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” representing the kind of critics-forward pick that can surprise if the vote splinters.\n\nSupporting actor has its own volatility, with Stellan Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value” and Sean Penn for “One Battle After Another” both positioned as credible spoilers. And supporting actress may be the flashpoint category of the night, with Ariana Grande for “Wicked: For Good” and Teyana Taylor for “One Battle After Another” standing as the most headline-ready threats to any presumed frontrunner. Even Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas has the chance to spoil.\n\nThe Critics Choice Association, comprising of roughly 575 voting members, has historically served as a reliable barometer for Oscar momentum. Last year’s best picture winner “Anora” used its CCA victory to reassert itself in the race after Golden Globe and SAG Awards shutouts, ultimately carrying that momentum to Academy Awards glory. However, this is a different time as this marks the first major awards ceremony of the year, and Oscar voting set to begin on Jan. 12.

This post contains details from the finale of Netflix‘s Stranger Things.\n\nOver the course of five seasons of Stranger Things, Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer) went from a timid young high schooler to a self-assured, gun-wielding force in her town’s fight against inter-dimensional monsters.\n\nThe series finale, which arrived on Netflix on New Year’s Eve, even saw Nancy offer herself up as bait to lure the Mind Flayer toward a set of cliffs that would give the rest of the crew a better angle to ambush it — even though it meant running into a narrow dead end where, if things went wrong, she’d be quickly eaten. She’s come a long way, growing season-over-season with the show, Dyer admits.\n\n“I mean, the finale really kind of felt a bit like an action movie at times, just so wildly different from things that we were doing in Season 1,” she tells Deadline on Friday morning. “Getting to live with these characters and grow with these characters and have them in these bigger and bigger scenarios has been so fun, such a training ground, such a fun place to grow up and grow as an actor.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nIn the interview below, Dyer spoke more about the finale season including Nancy and Jonathan’s breakup scene, the idea for Nancy’s future she influenced, and her experience closing this chapter after a decade on Stranger Things.\n\nSTRANGER THINGS: SEASON 5. (L to R) Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler, Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers, Joe Keery as Steve Harrington, and Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson in Stranger Things: Season 5. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix/Netflix © 2025\n\nDEADLINE: How does it feel watching the world experience the finale?\n\nNATALIA DYER: I mean, it’s kind of surreal. Yeah, I’m happy that it’s out, happy that we’re not sitting on all this information anymore. But also, the word that keeps getting [tossed around is] it’s so bittersweet. It’s like a real final goodbye. So, yeah, we’ll probably be processing our feelings for a long time.\n\nDEADLINE: I saw you were with the cast and the Duffers together to watch the finale recently. How was that?\n\nDYER: So beautiful and perfect. It was something we talked about doing for a while, and I’m so glad we were able to make that happen, because it was just really special to do that [and] have that moment for ourselves to see it all together in a theater. There wasn’t a dry eye.\n\nDEADLINE: I have loved Nancy’s character growth. What’s the process been like for you as an actor to go from this timid young girl in Season 1 to, by the end of it, being the person to offer themselves up as bait for the Mind Flayer?\n\nDYER: It’s been so fun. Nancy’s journey has been just, I couldn’t have possibly predicted it. I mean, the finale really kind of felt a bit like an action movie at times, just so wildly different from things that we were doing in Season 1. Getting to live with these characters and grow with these characters and have them in these bigger and bigger scenarios has been so fun, such a training ground, such a fun place to grow up and grow as an actor. We all really care about these characters and love them, so it’s been a really fun time.\n\nDEADLINE: It has expanded so much in scale and scope since you all started. How did you reflect on that while making this final season? It really was quite modest at the beginning.\n\nDYER: Oh, yeah. I mean, it was a quiet show [and],I guess, just felt more contained, and to see it grow and expand, and all the lore, even as somebody who’s on the show and finding that expanding and exploring that, and begging the Duffers for questions, trying to understand what’s going on underneath it all — it’s kind of wild. It’s wild to think about these characters, where they started out and saving the world, I guess, by the end of it.\n\nSTRANGER THINGS. (L to R) Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers in STRANGER THINGS. Cr. Matt Kennedy/Netflix © 2025\n\nDEADLINE: I really enjoyed the video Netflix released of you all at the table read for Episode 4. What were the table reads like for Volume 2 and the finale, just finally getting all those answers?\n\nDYER: Kind of surreal, I think, finding out what the end is for all of these characters. I mean, obviously there’s a lot with the Abyss and the bridge and understanding a lot of the sciences, but then just the characters and where they’re going. The last table read was just very emotional and very satisfying, I think, for us as actors. We love all these characters, and the Duffers love these characters. I think everybody was very happy and sad. Mike’s whole speech at the end absolutely destroyed the whole room. Just what it meant to the characters, but also what it meant the actors working on it for so long. You’re trying to sit with it, and you’ve got to go work on it, and you’ve got to go do it, but I think always keeping in your mind that you’re like, ‘Wow. Okay, this is it,’ and every little moment it’s like, ‘Wow, this is the last one.’\n\nDEADLINE: How did you feel about Nancy’s ending? I mean, breaking up with Jonathan but also we find out at the very end that she’s dropped out of school and is pursuing a career at the paper.\n\nDYER: We really love that [breakup] scene, and we love having that scene and getting to do that scene, because a lot of the Nancy-Jonathan dynamic, you don’t get to see on screen, because there’s so much action and other things, and that’s true of a lot of characters, a lot of the relationships. You can only fit so much into a show. So having that scene is so nice, because you get to see the weight all of this has had on them, and how much love there really is still there. They think they might be dying in that moment. So, the truth of it becomes really important. Once I read that, I felt like [it was] maybe the only way and the best way, and a really satisfying way, for this love relationship to come to a close. That was really beautiful.\n\nThe end, I would say Nancy not being in school is something I was very adamant about. The Duffers, they’d go around a little bit and be like, ‘Well, what do you think?’ They’re very collaborative. They would ask, like, ‘Where do you see your character? What do you think?’ Just kind of checking in with the actors, which I thought was really nice. My main thing is like, I just do not think Nancy could go back to school. I just cannot see her in school. and that was something that I said, ‘Pretty please. I just cannot.’ I remember reading the epilogue like, ‘Yeah, that’s perfect.’ For me. For Nancy. I felt really satisfied. I think after everything she’s been through, I just couldn’t [see her] writing papers and turning it in. You know? It’s hard, in a way, you feel so much love and care for these characters, and you want so many things for them, but you also wanted to stay kind of grounded. I think for everybody, it felt really good.\n\nDEADLINE: The Duffers told me that they at least tried to use mostly practical effects for the breakup scene. I heard there were some issues. But what was that experience like for you to juggle that kind of chaos with also finding the emotional center of that scene?\n\nDYER: It was so fun and challenging having this sort of melted goo — and I know there was a lot of talk about the consistency, and was it right on the day — but it was so challenging. Such a gift, especially these days when we have CGI and AI, and getting to work with things that are so practical like that, I think, really felt monumental as an actor. You’re just like, ‘This is so cool,’ when you get to do this. But also, I think it helps. Anything like that always helps with the emotion of a scene and just being there and being in it. I mean, really in it. You’re covered in it. You’re rolling around in it all day. So it’s one of those very exhausting, cold, wet days that’s so fun to do.\n\nDEADLINE: There’s also been some chatter that the cast stuck around after they wrapped to watch a lot of their fellow cast wrap, and you guys were all there for the final day of filming. What was that experience like?\n\nDYER: Gosh, yeah, I think a lot of people were going to each other’s wraps, and that just felt so natural, really, but so lovely and important. For us to see everybody down there, like Finn and all the kids and Cara [Buono], it means a lot. Being there for the basement day, the last, last day, and just getting to watch them wrap out and wrap these characters out is really, really powerful. I wouldn’t miss it.\n\nFinn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair, Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler, Joe Keery as Steve Harrington, Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers and Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson in ‘Stranger Things’ Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: This show was a part of your life for a decade, and it’s pretty rare to have that kind of consistency as an actor, especially so early in your career. How formative has it been for you to have that consistency?\n\nDYER: I mean, you feel very lucky. It’s just not something that’s guaranteed, ever, to have that steady job. Cast has referenced it as, like, summer camp, in a sense. You get to keep going back to this thing. It really is such a gift, especially when you like the people that you’re working with, which is also a gift. Having all of those elements together, it’s so rare, and I think that’s so not lost on any of us. I remember at the end of Season 1, when we were wrapping, I don’t think it had really occurred to me that there could be a Season 2, at that point. I don’t know. I guess I assumed it was a limited series or something where I was like, ‘Okay, well, that’s it.’ Then they’re like, ‘Well, I hope we get a Season 2.’ And you’re like, ‘Oh, wow, well, that would be amazing. This has been so much fun. That would be great to get a Season 2.’ My gosh, having it go for about a decade, I think all of us are just feeling so, so grateful for that and grateful to the fans, as well, because that doesn’t happen without all the support that you get from that side of things.\n\nDEADLINE: So we get a sense of what Nancy’s up to after they close the Upside Down for good, but how do you think she’s just been coping with all of this trauma and loss? She lost so much agency throughout this process, as a lot of them did.\n\nDYER: Oh, gosh, yeah, I think you’re right, that they all get sort of pulled into this. I think there’s a lot of different ways you could feel about this. I think that’s part of what I admire so much about Nancy, is that she went after the truth. She lost her friend, and she wanted to figure it out, and she wanted justice. There can be a problem [inside] of that as well. She can be righteous, and she can be bullheaded about things. She didn’t back down from it. I think she finds pieces of herself, and she makes mistakes. She’s definitely not perfect. I think instead of letting this thing destroy her, she tries her best to find strength in it and tries to manage and control. In this season, there’s a sense of leadership and trying to logically attack this thing, and understanding that you can’t control everything. I think she tries to find her strength through all of these terrible, truly terrifying things that keep happening to them.\n\nDEADLINE: My last question for you is just what are you looking forward to next?\n\nDYER: It’s the new year. It’s been feeling very, very nostalgic for all of us, in a way. We’re processing, but excited for this next chapter. It definitely feels like a closing of a chapter. So, we’ll see what happens.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T16:34:50.088101"}

For Hollywood in particular, the year’s events prompted the biggest reckoning yet with AI, which permeated the industry with the promise of efficiency and new artistic horizons but also threats to longstanding business practices.\n\nDeadline’s ranking of the top 10 AI stories of the year spans the financial, creative and tech sectors and covers everything from talent disruptions to dealmaking, corporate battles to union strategies. Subscribers to our twice-monthly TechLine newsletter already are acquainted with many of these happenings – sign up here to keep current. Rendering, a regular column by Deadline International Investigations Editor Jake Kanter, also explores new AI developments. (Find previous editions of the column here.)\n\nGenerative AI video models already were known to be a force for Hollywood to reckon with, but the release of OpenAI’s Sora 2 last fall upped the ante because of its technological sophistication and implications for copyrighted work. Initially, the company told copyright holders they would have to proactively opt out if they wanted their works to be excluded. As the model hit the public, though, videos featuring Martin Luther King Jr. and Bryan Cranston drew initial backlash, leading to some modifications. At the same time, though, there was a growing sense in the industry that the genie was not about to return to the bottle. Which leads us to our No. 2 story of the year ….\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nRELATED: CAA Issues Rebuke Of OpenAI/Sora’s Hollywood Infiltration & Its Potential To Rip Off Artist Clients\n\nIn a deal that brought to mind the old Bill Murray line from Ghostbusters — “Dogs and cats, living together, mass hysteria!” — the media giant and the well-funded startup agreed on a landmark exchange inDecember. After initially refusing to take part in the Sora 2 rollout, Disney then decided to allow several of its characters to be used in the generative AI videos and also paid $1 billion for an equity stake in OpenAI. The agreement ultimately could prove more symbolic than tangibly meaningful, but it sent a signal that entertainment companies and IP holders seem to be getting more pragmatic about the AI threat. With proper guardrails and financial incentives, many stakeholders appear willing to sit down at the bargaining table with the very companies they have threatened to sue.\n\nRELATED: Disney’s OpenAI Deal: Soulless Exploitation Or Necessary Innovation? Former Mouse House Animators Have Thoughts\n\nFor a “star” who doesn’t actually exist in human form, Tilly Norwood generated more buzz than a squad of Taylor Swifts. Created by actor and technologist Eline Van der Velden and introduced during a Deadline-moderated panel at last fall’s Zurich Summit, Tilly soon was pursued for potential representation by real-life agents, Deadline was assured. Whether or not she gets signed for representation, Tilly’s “girl-next-door authenticity,” as Van der Velden put it, was achieved without any of the hair-and-makeup hassles of human performers. That efficiency one day could tempt some cash-strapped producers – and in fact, most entertainment companies are quietly experimenting with generative AI, Van der Velden asserted. It was no surprise, then, that SAG-AFTRA and a number of other major Hollywood entities issued strongly worded statements against a Till-ified future.\n\nRELATED: Tilly Norwood Creator Eline Van Der Velden Talks Backlash, Reveals Another 40 AI Actors Are In The Pipeline & Explains Why They Will Never Replace Real Actors\n\nChina-based DeepSeek hit the broader radar in January when it was revealed that the company spent less than $6 million to train its AI models — a fraction of the hundreds of billions being shoveled into the furnace by U.S. firms. It quickly topped the app store download charts as the public rushed to see for itself what the company was building. The idea of a China-based AI company having better technology and more favorable economics than Big Tech sent shivers through the U.S. financial community. The Nasdaq fell 3% and companies like Nvidia and Alphabet saw their valuations shaved. By year-end, DeepSeek remained a threat even though it has left the headlines.\n\n5. Start-Up Gold Rush\n\nEmerging companies such as Luma, Promise and Runway, on the larger end of a field of dozens of start-up players in AI entertainment, collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars, at valuations well into the billions. Bubble? What bubble?\n\nIn 2023, the Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA both went on strike, staging the first dual walkout in decades, in part due to uncertainty over AI. The theme only has intensified as the major above-the-line unions all get set to negotiate new three-year deals with studios and streamers during the coming months. Copyright law veterans Jonathan Handel and Mishawn Nolan weighed in on a panel at October’s Infinity Festival, offering an unsettling preview. “The way that we’ve always done business can’t be done in the future,” Nolan cautioned. Handel called the arrival of Tilly Norwood and other synthetic performers “a difficult situation” given the lack of any language about synthetic performers in prior contracts.\n\nRELATED: Hollywood’s Big New Labor Pitch: Studios To Offer Guilds’ Health Plans $100M Lifeline In Exchange For Longer Multi-Year Contracts In 2026\n\n7. Creative Differences\n\nAs 2025 unfolded, a split developed in the creative community between the “boomers” and the “doomers,” to borrow a phrase from tech writer Karen Hao in her book, Empire of AI. Filmmakers including George Miller and Paul Schrader, plus a number of specialists in animation and visual effects, articulated the upside of AI. Visionaries James Cameron and Reed Hastings joined the boards of leading AI companies. They expressed curiosity and optimism about it marshaling an entirely new set of creative tools. On the other side, dozens of leading directors, writers and actors adopted a firm stance against the growing influence of the technology. None was quite as pointed as Guillermo del Toro. While accepting a Gotham Award in early December, the director said his latest film, Frankenstein, was made “willfully made by humans, for humans.” He punctuated his remarks by yelling, “F*ck AI!”\n\nRELATED: Production Designers Are Worldbuilders For Directors, But 66% Fear Being Replaced By AI\n\nAs creatives joust about the best path forward, the UK’s Channel 4 embarked on an experiment that could be called either bold or reckless, depending on one’s point of view. At the end of a documentary called Will AI Take My Job?, the broadcaster revealed that the host of the program had been entirely computer-generated. Execs then said they are planning more AI initiatives.\n\nHoping to do for AI what The Social Network did for social media, Amazon MGM greenlighted Artificial, whose starry cast is led by Andrew Garfield. Director Luca Guadagnino’s film, which wrapped principal photography in the fall, is said to center on the saga of Sam Altman’s firing and subsequent re-hiring as CEO of OpenAI.\n\n10. Gemini Rising\n\nOnce written off as a distant challenger to OpenAI, Google’s primary AI platform Gemini made sizable gains in 2025. The traction helped lift parent company Alphabet’s stock by 65% and triggered what Altman reportedly characterized as a “code red” at OpenAI as the company raced to reassert its dominance. Disney, which now is business partners with OpenAI, fired off a cease-and-desist letter to Google in December over what it said were copyright violations by Gemini, guaranteeing that the derby is far from over. (Deadline parent Penske Media Corp also has filed a lawsuit against Google, claiming Gemini has unlawfully repurposed PMC content in its AI summaries.)\n\nRELATED: How Australia’s First AI Film Festival Convinced ‘Mad Max’ Director George Miller Of A Creative Revolution", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T17:25:02.327560"}

The Visionary Award, which honors boundary-breaking cinema. The award is being presented jointly to a director and cast for the first time in recognition of their exceptional collaboration.\n\nThe following day on Jan. 4, del Toro will receive the Creative Impact in Directing Award at a special brunch.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBringing “Frankenstein” to the big screen has been a lifelong dream for the filmmaker, who has had a deep connection with the story ever since he read Mary Shelley’s classic at the age of 11.\n\nSpeaking recently in conversation with director Jason Reitman, del Toro said, “All my life, I’ve been aiming towards this movie. All 50 years of craft, thought, thematic pondering — everything. It is a fusion of the book, my life and what I know about the Romantic movement.”\n\nThe signs of his connection to “Frankenstein” are evident in his filmmaking, with elements of the story present in his films “Cronos” and “Pinocchio.” In his own words, the 2016 gothic romance “Crimson Peak” was a “dress rehearsal” for “Frankenstein.”\n\nWith his story, del Toro deconstructs the myth of “Frankenstein” and, rather than portraying the creature as a monster of horror, as other filmmakers have done before him, he creates a gentle, innocent and pure being played by Elordi. Isaac takes on the role of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the scientist who becomes obsessed with conquering death. In the film, Victor constructs a large lab and builds his creature using parts from dead soldiers.\n\nThroughout “Frankenstein,” del Toro employs various motifs. Religion plays a significant role in the film, asking the question: Can man play God? Visually, del Toro uses a circular design to symbolize the circular narrative. Color also plays a key role in the film, with red, white and blue being the dominant choices.\n\n“We follow Victor’s experiments in the lab, which have the language of red and reflect the brutality of Victor as an artist whose musical notes happen to be anatomical,” del Toro told Variety. “Victor and Elizabeth [Goth] are the only ones who will wear red because Elizabeth is the mother figure, in a sense, and Victor is on a quest for eternal life because his mother died,” he adds. “All these elements come into play with the color and art direction.”\n\nAs Victor constructs his lab and assembles the Creature, the various stages of its creation are meticulously portrayed.\n\nSeamless stitching and different coloration on the Creature’s body reflect how Victor has pieced it together from body parts found on the battlefield. “By the time the Creature is revealed, [the audience] will have already seen the things that make him unique,” del Toro says. “He looks like a newborn, not like an ICU victim. And that’s important.”\n\ndel Toro’s “Frankenstein” is anything but a horror story. It raises questions and ends on a note of forgiveness.\n\n“The question of the book is: What makes us human, and why are we here?” del Toro explains. Forgiveness and acceptance, he says, are values that we are losing every\n\nday. “The movie hopes to provoke emotion from a text that is 200 years old because it’s telling us we should know better,” he adds.\n\nAs for the Creature’s poignant line, “I forgive you,” del Toro reflects: “It’s the one we don’t hear often enough.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T18:36:04.911496"}

But there was one constant: the dysfunction.\n\n“My own mom and dad had an explosive and volcanic relationship,” he recalls. “My dad was a pro wrestler at a time when it was the Wild West. There wasn’t million-dollar contracts. It was paycheck to paycheck and just trying to survive. And my dad struggled with his addictions and focused on his career and himself, while my mom was at home, raising me. She had to give up her own dreams and support the man that she loves. All she wanted was to be seen, and she was never seen. And I grew up watching that kind of decline in a relationship when a man battles his own demons. I watched their fights. I heard their fights, which is even worse.”\n\nFor the 26-year span of his acting career, Johnson compartmentalized the pain and instead focused on breezy tough-guy roles in such billion-dollar-plus juggernauts as “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” and “Furious 7.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“For years, I didn’t know that could actually serve as a landing place for me to be able to put all this trauma you go through into my work,” he explains. “I was probably scared to go there.”\n\nBut in 2017, he felt the courage to plumb the past and began pursuing the life rights of MMA fighter Mark Kerr, whose drug addiction fettered his career as a two-time UFC heavyweight champ in the late ’90s. The result is A24’s “The Smashing Machine,” a career pinnacle for Johnson, who sinks so thoroughly into a protagonist both bruising and bruised that he is unrecognizable.\n\nVariety will celebrate Johnson with the Creative Impact in Acting Award at the 2026 Palm Springs International Film Festival. The superstar, who received his first-ever Golden Globe nomination for his work in “Smashing Machine,” is set to receive the honor on Jan. 4 during Variety’s annual brunch.\n\nWith the role, he didn’t merely confront his own rocky past. Johnson, who parlayed his own professional wrestling stardom into movie A-lister, follows on the heels of several recent actresses long been defined by their bodies rather than their bodies of work who delivered revelatory performances including Demi Moore (“The Substance”), Nicole Scherzinger (“Sunset Boulevard”) and Pamela Anderson (“The Last Showgirl”). For actors, that opportunity and feat is even rarer. But when Johnson first approached Benny Safdie in 2019 with the idea of bringing Kerr’s story to the big screen, the director recognized Johnson’s potential.\n\n“He said, ‘I want to make this film with you. I know how to make it. I’m going to write the script on spec,’” Johnson says of Safdie, who had worked exclusively with his brother Josh in the past on such acclaimed indies as the Adam Sandler starrer “Uncut Gems” and the Robert Pattinson star vehicle “Good Times.” Johnson met with both brothers but says “Smashing Machine” was always developed as a solo effort by Benny.\n\n“After ‘Uncut Gems,’ I felt like they were probably having their conversations about going in different directions,” he says.\n\nThe director and actor’s vision quickly dovetailed thanks to their shared experience of being in the destructive orbit of substance abuse.\n\n“I realized how much we had in common. I said, ‘Benny, I’ve lost 15 friends to addiction and suicide. Perhaps this could serve as a beacon or lighthouse to people who are struggling with addiction,” Johnson remembers. “And Benny began sharing with me everything that he had experienced with his own family members and addictions.”\n\nIn fact, Safdie’s experiences shaped a riveting eight-minute scene near the end of “Smashing Machine,” in which Johnson and co-star Emily Blunt, who portrays Kerr’s girlfriend Dawn Staples, play out the culmination of their co-dependent spiral.\n\n“Benny goes, ‘If you guys could wind up on the floor, that would really mean a lot to me,’” Johnson says of the bathroom scene. “And I said to him, ‘Why the floor?’ And he paused and said, ‘Well, I’ve been through that. I know what it’s like to hold someone while they’re kicking and screaming. You don’t want to let go.’ And then I realized that’s why the story connected so deeply with us.”\n\nJohnson says it was a first for him — to have an opportunity to sit in his pain along with the audience. “It was the most freeing I have ever felt in my entire career,” he says. “When you make these blockbuster films, you have the responsibility of making the audience feel good and the choices you make [are dictated by] the character’s likability. And for the first time, every shot, every day, regardless of the scene, that never crossed my mind.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T18:36:05.552784"}

Dokoupil appeared in a promo, for example, alleging that legacy media outlets have not covered past events well “because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.” CBS News said Friday that one of its new principles was “We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so.” But taking such a stance could undermine the operation’s newsgathering, particularly on a day when President Trump declared that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela after capturing its president.\n\nWill CBS take a pro-government stance or follow facts where they lead? The Paramount Skydance’s recent statements cast fog around the issue. Followers of Dokoupil’s Instagram account raised similar questions in recent days, and Dokoupil responded to some, noting that he had written the words to his recent promo and urged people to “Hold me to them.”\n\nCBS News is being recalibrated by its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss, an opinion provocateur who previously led The Free Press, a site that made plain its support of an anti-woke stance as well as of Israel. Paramount bought the outlet for a reported $150 million earlier this year and installed Weiss as head of CBS News’ editorial operations, alongside president Tom Cibrowski. Since her arrival, Weiss, who has no experience managing a large traditional media operation, has drawn increasing scrutiny. She set up a new series of town hall discussions and debates, chastised the newsroom and other traditional media organizations and, most recently, spurred controversy by calling for a fully vetted and reported “60 Minutes” segment to be held.\n\nDokoupil was to have launched his “Evening News” tenure on Monday, kicking off an effort to report from various U.S. cities and towns.

I think he is, and for reasons that include the fact that he’s a scoundrel. (Has there ever been a likable scoundrel in movies? No! Not Once!) The number-one reason we like — or, at least, I like — Marty Mauser is, of course, that he’s played by Timothée Chalamet, the most charismatic movie star of his generation. Chalamet, like Dustin Hoffman or Julia Roberts or Brad Pitt, has the X factor, a quality that draws us to him regardless of what he does. (Just look at some of those outfits he wore on the red carpet when he was becoming a star. Without the X factor, those clothes would have looked postmodern gaudy ridiculous; with the X factor, they still sometimes did, but they became…defining. In sporting those clothes, he shifted the whole culture.)\n\nIn “Marty Supreme,” Chalamet’s Marty is a 23-year-old Ping-Pong wizard who’s a total selfish monomaniac, and not without good cause. The year is 1952, and Marty thinks he’s the greatest table-tennis player in the world. From what we can see, he may well be. The Ping-Pong matches in “Marty Supreme” are more exciting than the car races in “F1” or the fight scenes in 49 out of 50 boxing movies. They’re existential ballets of whirling spinning back-and-forth high-flying no-he-didn’t-just-do-that! action. The challenge that confronts Marty is this: How can he get the world to witness his skill? He keeps having to scrape up money to attend international tournaments, and since he has no money, that means that he has to lie, cheat, steal, gamble, hustle, seduce, manipulate, and at one point find the will to endure a heavy round of corporal-punishment-by-Ping-Pong-paddle. Through all of this, he treats everyone around him, including his pregnant girlfriend, like they don’t matter. He acts like a textbook sociopath, and maybe he is one.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBut if that’s the case, he’s a sociopath with a dream. Marty doesn’t merely want to succeed; he doesn’t just want to win. He wants to change the karma of his life, which means building a castle in the air atop the rickety-to-nonexistent foundation of his background as a poor Jewish kid from the Lower East Side. The way Chalamet plays Marty, with a come-hither smirk, eyes that are clear and fun-loving and burningly alive, and a motormouth that won’t quit, he’s a kid who never stops hustling and deceiving, but all because he knows that his hustles are going to add up to something greater than the sum of their deceptions. They’re going to take him to the next level. They’re going to allow him to transcend.\n\nAnd here’s the point. Unless he does all this, he will not transcend. He will fail. So it’s not just that he’s a charming duplicitous hustler sociopath. It’s that life has called upon him to be a charming duplicitous hustler sociopath. He fulfills his destiny by making it up as he goes along, and by being utterly ruthless in the journey.\n\nMarty is what we used to call an antihero: a character we identify with and root for, even though he has many qualities that are less than heroic. You remember antiheroes, don’t you? They were at the center of so many of those movies from the 1970s that everyone says they love so much — the movies “you couldn’t make today.” But that morally ambiguous good-bad quality of Marty Mauser has ruffled some feathers in our age of holier-if-not-hipper-than-thou puritanical judgment, where everyone is so busy trying to righteously one-up everyone else. Marty has been declared, within a certain swath of social media, to be a poor role model. He’s too selfish, too aggro, too entitled, too toxic…too dislikable. Is this an organic expression of distaste, or is it part of the movie’s Oscar Take-Down Campaign? Maybe both. Either way, it’s enough to make you wonder if we’re witnessing a 21st-century revival of the Legion of Decency.\n\nOr maybe it’s a revival of that fabled Hollywood figure: the corrupt 1980s studio executive, the one who was so wired into test screenings that he couldn’t let a moment of bad behavior slide by without asking, “But will the audience like that?” Have we completely forgotten that movies — and movie heroes — aren’t always supposed to be likable or nice, that they’re supposed to have rough edges and sometimes look as flawed as most of us are? Or even more so?\n\nThat dynamic has always been an integral part of movies, and that’s why movies have always been controversial. They don’t just depict sin — they celebrate it. The gangster films of the early ’30s, like “The Public Enemy” and “Scarface,” asked people to identity with depraved killers, which was quite a radical stance for the early 20th century. But audiences were ready to embrace something radical, because they had been disillusioned by life (the Depression was all around them), and Hollywood, from the start, was about giving voice to the inner urges of the dispossessed. Was it “responsible” to ask viewers to identity with James Cagney, in “The Public Enemy,” smooshing a grapefruit into Mae Clarke’s face, or Paul Muni in “Scarface” shooting up the works with a Thompson submachine gun? The question answers itself. Of course it wasn’t. But it was liberating, precisely because it wasn’t responsible. That’s why movies are such a beautifully dangerous art form.\n\nSo here we are 100 years later, living in a culture that’s more liberated and unhinged than anything the citizens of the 1930s could have dreamed of. We’re now a nation of addicts and sensationalists; our mainstream entertainment (the extreme horror films, the TikTok fashion-porn videos) flirts, on a daily basis, with depravity. And here is Josh Safdie, the brilliant director of “Marty Supreme,” making a movie that’s linked in many ways to “Uncut Gems,” the landmark 2019 thriller he co-directed with his brother Benny, starring Adam Sandler as a degenerate gambler (a character all but ruled by his dislikable qualities). “Marty Supreme” is like “Uncut Gems” remade as a follow-your-dream crowd-pleaser. Yet this is a movie, and a movie hero, that the forces of performative virtue have somehow deemed…not moral and upstanding enough!\n\nIf you look closely, though, he really is. That’s the film’s — and Chalamet’s — extraordinary triumph. A movie star’s charisma is more than magnetism or sex appeal or “likability.” It’s a kind of spiritual-moral power, a force that bends those of us in the audience toward the actor who has it. Staring up at the big screen, we chime with that person, responding to their very being. We’re drawn into the flow of their action and motivation, into the essential trigger of why they do what they do. In “Marty Supreme,” Timothée Chalamet doesn’t just play a sociopathic scoundrel. He shows us what it looks like when you’ve steeled yourself to triumph over a life that’s going to throw you another stumbling block every minute, that’s going to make you jump through hoops to find your new self. And when Marty finally does, collapsing on the floor in exhilarated exhaustion after a table-tennis showdown because he has finally turned destiny around, you want to applaud how much this devotedly selfish, spectacularly flawed character has become all of us, because all he really wanted was to be happy. To be the supreme version of himself.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:58:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T18:58:44.246454"}

Joel has a home in the area and owns nearby Middlesea Farms.\n\nJoel walked with the aid of a cane in taking the stage, as captured on fan video. “You want to sing it or am I gonna sing it?” the Turnstiles frontman asked as Joel sat at the keyboard.\n\n“What are we doing?” Joel asked, making it clear he was up for handling the vocals as well as piano.\n\n“A Billy Joel song, how about?” suggested the band member, playfully.\n\n“I can give it a try. I know the guy who wrote it,” Joel said with a laugh, as they launched into “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” At one point, the star needed a cue in remembering some of the legendarily voluminous lyrics, somewhere around the “Reagan… Palestine” part of the historical listmaking, but the band member obliged with a reminder, and Joel was able to continue with the tune from memory.\n\nAfter a huddle on stage about what to do as a followup, the performance continued with “Big Shot.”\n\n“I have to be dreaming this,” said the group’s usual singer, as Joel exited the stage with his family. “I’m gonna pinch myself. It had to happen sooner or later, right?… We wanna see you on stage soon.”\n\nJoel’s May exit from touring was tied to a buildup of fluid on his brain, with a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), for which he said he would be seeking physical therapy as well as canceling all shows indefinitely. In a July interview with Bill Maher, he affirmed that he felt fine apart from difficulty keeping his balance, something that had become apparent when he had a fall on stage in February.\n\nEven without fulfilling a planned run of arena shows, Joel had a big public profile in 2025, thanks to the release in the summer of an acclaimed two-part HBO documentary “Billy Joel: And So It Goes,” which managed to captivate a large audience of non-fans as well as the Joel faithful.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:34:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-03T19:40:31.637983"}

What will go down when Bad Bunny takes the Super Bowl halftime show stage? Have the Rolling Stones hit the end of the road because of Keith Richards‘ health? With so many people out of work and production still reeling, what’s on the table for the upcoming contract talks between the studios and streamers with the Hollywood guilds? When will the LA County DA decide if prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Nick Reiner? And of course, will it be Netflix or Paramount who ends up plunking down billions and billions to own Warner Bros Discovery after all?\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAll those questions will surely be answered before 2027, and probably a few more no one has considered yet – that’s right AI, we weren’t ignoring you. So, in no particular order, are the stories that will really matter in the media and entertainment worlds this year, so far.\n\n(Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski via Getty Images)\n\nTHE NEXT DISNEY CEO IS …\n\nWith an announcement expected in the next few weeks if Dana Walden, Josh D’Amaro or someone else are getting the top gig, it’s pretty fair to assume at this point Bob Iger and House of Mouse board bossJames Gorman know who will be succeeding the two-time Disney CEO atop the Magic Kingdom at the end of this year. Still, despite a rumor mill grinding harder than a Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland, that person or persons will be the openly campaigning Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment or the smooth parks division running Chairman of Disney Experiences is a decision that’s been kept closer to the chest that an Oscar envelope on Hollywood’s big night (which BTW, won’t be something any Disney CEO will have to worry about come 2029 and YouTube taking over the ceremony).\n\nBenefiting or burdening by her close friendship with Kamala Harris and her active role in Jimmy Kimmel’s weeklong September suspension, Walden has publicly said part of the CEO process is she doesn’t like “being pit against my colleagues, I don’t appreciate because we have incredible relationships.” At the same time, no one is going to fault the very circumspect Gorman and gang from doing everything humanly possible to avoid the fumbles, egos and backstabbing of Bob Chapek’s short-lived reign as Iger’s first successor from 2020 to 2022. If the AI-investing 74-year-old Iger really does exit (are you a betting person?) when his current contract is up at the end of 2026, the new CEO will face some of the biggest challenges of the industry in decades – especially if Netflix gobbles up Warner Bros’ studio, HBO and streaming assets.\n\nWhich is why word on the street and the Burbank lot is deep and serious consideration has gone into taking a page out of the streamer’s book and installing co-CEO’s like Netflix has with the carefully coordinated Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters. To paraphrase, Walden, that would be an “incredible relationship” to see in action with her and D’Amaro running the shop. It would make some history, play to everyone strengths and ensure stability in an era of anything but – so, stay tuned. – DP\n\nThe Washington Monument has imagery projected on to it on Jan. 2, 2026 marking America’s 250th anniversary (Photo: Getty)\n\nAMERICA 250\n\nThe quarter-millennium anniversary of the United States will have a lot of the surface hoopla of the Bicentennial fifty years ago, but likely a lot of the same media contemplation of 1976: How united are we? The aftermath of Watergate and the Vietnam War threatened to color America’s anniversary as forced patriotism, but the enduring image of the celebration turned out to be the beauty of the tall ships sailing in New York harbor. Likewise, Donald Trump‘s divisive presidency raises doubts as to how celebratory the whole of America will be. The Trump factor has raised discord even on the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, the bipartisan body set up by Congress to plan official celebrations. As divided as the country was fifty years ago, things seemed to fall into place in the months leading up to July 4, with Americans getting a nightly history refresher via CBS’s Bicentennial Minutes and everything from fire hydrants to giant dams painted in the red, white and blue. What will the enduring image be of 2026? UFC fights at the White House, planned for Trump’s birthday, June 14? – TJ\n\nKeith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Mick Jagger, and Steve Jordan of The Rolling Stones onstage at LA’s SoFi Stadium on July 10, 2024 (Photo: Getty)\n\nKEITH RICHARDS ROLLING NO MORE?\n\nThe mid-December missive that the Rolling Stones were pulling the plug on a planned but not officially announced 2026 UK and European tour sent shutters that not only had the greatest rock’n’roll band of all time had reached the end of the road, but that mortality had caught up with the seemingly indestructible Keith Richards. Having just turned 82 and suffering from arthritis gnarled hands, the guitarist/legendary hedonist apparently informed Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood that he just wasn’t up for the rigors of another multi-city stint. Even though the “Human Riff” had showed up in fine form for a Bruce Willis honoring mini-set at NYC’s Soho Sessions in November, worries that Richards was in dire health ran rampant.\n\nTo that, to defang the obit writers, a smiling and sturdy Keef posted a “one love” affirming NYD greeting online the other day.\n\nOn the flip side, the Stones, including the world’s greatest still living rhythm guitarist Richards, have laid down new music to be released this year in a follow up to 2023’s acclaimed Hackney Diamonds – which the band toured behind in 2024. So perhaps, the six-string pirate and the old boys are planning a special one-off to show they can still blow everyone’s wigs off. Time might just still be on their side – DP\n\nGetty Images\n\nCAA‘S HOME NOT ON THE RANGE\n\nIn our ever shaking and quaking media landscape, the foundation and future of the agencies often gets overlooked – which is more than okay with the self-styled masters of the universes at CAA, WME, UTA …and Range. The dealmakers prefer to do most of their business under the cover of darkness, for better or worse. However, this year we may see a seismic shift in both the agency biz, who controls the purse and what an agency actually is. For the long warring Bryan Lourd and Peter Micelli run firms in particular that change will come courtesy of the courts. Locked in dispute both behind the closed (but much leaking) doors of arbitration and in the public sphere of LA Superior Court, CAA & Range Media Partners (which has some very sharp ex-CAA staffers among its upper ranks) have abandoned the ubiquitous air of Marquess of Queensberry Rules everyone likes to pretend to adhere to in public and gone bare knuckles.\n\nWill the arbitrator decide David Bugliari, Michael Cooper, Michael Sullivan and Jack Whigham are due the “tens of millions of dollars of the former agents’ vested equity” that CAA clawed back when they jumped ship back in 2020? Will a jury decide the “unlawful” (according to CAA’s initial 2024 lawsuit) and seemingly fully loaded Range are actually a talent agency masquerading as a management group? Will the same jury also find Range guilty of poaching staff, talent and intel for its creation, as CAA alleges, or will they cut CAA down to size for violation of unfair competition law and tortious interference, as Range’s November 2025 countersuit claims?\n\nCertain to go through rounds of appeals regardless of how wins first in the coming months, the results will likely also see rivals-down-the-road WME gloat at what some have called a CAA self-inflicted wound. Either way, no matter the final cost and verdict, there will be a culling and there will be blood. – DP\n\nGetty\n\nNETFLIX BE DAMNED, PARAMOUNT’S PURSUIT OF WARNER BROS DISCOVERY ISN’T OVER\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery heads into 2026 with a Netflix deal in hand and Paramount Skydance pounding at the door in a high stakes takeover battle with momentous consequences for TV, film, theatrical exhibition and streaming. Netflix’s accepted offer of $27.75 in cash and stock for Warner Bros. Studios, HBO and HBO Max. has an equity value of $72 billion and an enterprise value (including net debt) of $82.7 billion As the would-be parters seek necessary approvals, WBD is moving ahead with a spinoff of its linear television assets into a new company called Discovery Global.\n\nDavid Ellison launched his WBD offensive shortly after closing the Paramount Skydance merger in August with a trio of unsolicited offers for the entire company, all rejected. Warner opened the process to other bidders and chose Netflix. The table was set for this showdown in 2022 when Zaslav-led Discovery acquired much larger Warner Media for $43 billion. That saddled the combined company with an untenable $50 billion in debt even as cable networks cratered and viewers flocked to streaming.\n\nThese are big numbers. Paramount’s $30 a share all-cash bid reflects an equity value of $77.9 billion and enterprise value of $108.4 billion. Rebuffed, David and his father Larry Ellison went hostile and have taken two offers directly to WBD stockholders, who have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares. WBD rejected the first and looks set to dismiss the second at a board meeting next week.\n\nThe Netflix and Paramount offers may not be that far apart financially. Paramount insists it has a better shot at regulatory approval. It has hinted at legal action, accusing WBD’s board of abandoning “the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders,” which WBD denies. Entertainment insiders are at a bit of a loss over who to back in this horserace.\n\nBut expect fireworks including a possible bidding war in 2026. Or, it could all go sideways. An unpredictable President Donald Trump, who has a serious beef with the news media including Paramount’s CBS and WBD’s CNN, has said he plans to be involved in a decision. The FTC and European regulators will weigh antitrust issues. The DOJ and state AGs may weigh in. So, there are massive breakup fees here. Both Netflix and Paramount agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if a deal fails to get regulatory approval. – JG\n\n(L-R) Rob Reiner , Michele Singer Reiner, Romy Reiner, Nick Reiner, Maria Gilfillan & Jake Reiner at Spinal Tap II: The End Continues LA Premiere in September 2025 (Photo: Getty) Getty\n\nNICK REINER & THE DEATH PENALTY\n\nRight now, pending a last minute pause, the January 7th scheduled hearing in DTLA for Nick Reiner for the December 14 killing of his parents Rob and Michele Reiner is still on the calendar. However, three unknowns still linger in this tragedy that has seen the addiction addled youngest child of the Misery director and his photographer spouse accused of two counts of first-degree murder with “special circumstances.”\n\nThe first is what the 32-year-old’s mental health is evaluated to have been at the time of the fatal attacks, and is he competent to stand trial? In now sealed medical records, Nick Reiner is said to have inflicted “multiple sharp force injuries” on his parents in their Brentwood home on the day of their deaths. The second, depending on what plea the Alan Jackson defended Nick Reiner enters next week, is when and whether there actually will be a trial? And, thirdly and lastly, when will the LA County District Attorney’s office decide if they are going to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the Being Charlie co-writer or the death penalty?\n\nDA Nathan Hochman said when announcing the charges against Nick Reiner on December 16 that he wanted to discuss the possible choices with the family before coming to any conclusions – as it is, that many have to occur sooner rather than later.\n\n“We are prepared for the arraignment whether it happens or not will be decided by a judge,” Venusse Dunn of the DA’s office told Deadline. “We are communicating with the victim’s family. As with all victims of crime, we maintain ongoing contact with those affected to keep them informed throughout the legal process and to provide support during this difficult time.”\n\nIndeed. – DP\n\nBad Bunny performs onstage in LA on March 17, 2025 (Photo: Getty)\n\nNFL VS MAGA: BAD BUNNY PLAYS THE SUPER BOWL\n\nMan, did MAGA lose their sh*t when the NFL, Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, and Apple Music revealed in September that Bad Bunny would be headlining the halftime show at Super Bowl LX on February 8.\n\nIn fact, with Donald Trump and various aides and cabinet members pouring anti-immigrant, ICE threatening and racist fuel on their own fire, the MAGA meltdown continues. As NFL chief Roger Goodell found himself in October having to publicly back “one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world” being in the Super Bowl spotlight, the now Erika Kirk-run TurningPoint USA have organized their unironically named All-American Halftime Show to counter program Bad Bunny on stage in Santa Clara, CA next month.\n\nHere’s the thing, MAGA really stepped in it here.\n\nThe leading contender to sweep this year’s Grammys, the Puerto Rico-born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio hasn’t shied away from the controversy, nor has Bad Bunny suddenly shut up about his opposition to MAGA and its policies as his one US show of this year looms.\n\nSet to perform the first all in Spanish Super Bowl set, Bad Bunny is also a Super Bowl vet. He joined JLo and Shakira in their 2020 halftime show in Miami. So, the real question has to be is MAGA opposed to capitalism, football and rewarding success? Asking for 19.8 billion streams worldwide in 2025 alone …or as Bad Bunny said in Spanish on SNL on October 4, addressing the issue and the contributions of Latinos to American culture: “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.” – DP\n\nGetty\n\nAMPTP VS. WGA, SAG-AFTRA & DGA: NEW RULES, HEALTH MONEY?\n\nHollywood is still recovering after the historically long writers and actors strikes that defined 2023’s bargaining cycle between the major studios and the above-the-line unions. While the 100-plus-day work stoppages resulted in multiple hard-won contract achievements, they also greatly accelerated a global production contraction that has upended the film and television industry. Nevertheless, the WGA, DGA and SAG-AFTRA will sit down with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers early next year to hopefully hammer out a new agreement before the current contracts expire mid-year.\n\nSAG-AFTRA will head to the bargaining table first in early February.\n\nPlenty of tantalizing topics, including the encroachment of AI and the pending sale of Warner Bros., are sure to grace the conversation, but they’ll almost certainly take a backseat to the financial realities the guilds are facing right now.\n\nTo that, the priorities are looking much different than three years ago as all three guilds will need to focus on one thing and one thing only: jobs, jobs, and more jobs. Well, and, relatedly, their dwindling health and pension funds, which we hear are in dire straits after several years of increasing unemployment around town. Deadline exclusively reported last month that the AMPTP is willing to offer the guilds a $110M cash infusion to get the funds back in the black, but in return they’re hoping to get the unions to agree to a five-year contract instead of the usual three, aiming to bring more stability to what is, at present, an incredibly unstable industry. Time will tell how things shake out, and most of Tinsel Town will watch these negotiations with bated breath, but don’t expect another 12-round knockout fight in 2026. Just about the only thing that’s certain in Hollywood right now is that no one can afford another strike. – KC\n\nPeople cast their ballots at a vote center in Los Angeles, on November 4, 2025 – a year ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterms (Photo: Getty) Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTHE MIDTERMS VERDICT ON TRUMP 2.0\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats away from taking control of the House, but a world away from actually achieving it. There are still 11 months until the November elections, and any major electoral cycle featuring Donald Trump as a candidate or major player is fraught with unpredictable twists and turns. That won’t stop a year of polling, prognostication and punditry, as news networks and upstarts chase after potential renewed audience interest. The party out of power tends to do very well in a midterm cycle of the president’s second term, but the challenge for media outlets is in explaining the variables this year, including redistricting, new voting restrictions and the potential for post-election challenges. The stakes are whether Trump will have to grapple with a congressional check on his power, but the election also will go a long way toward defining his ultimate legacy. – TJ\n\n(L-R) Gary Oldman & Stephen Colbert at Apple TV+ Emmy Awards Celebration for the 2025 Emmy Awards on September 14, 2025 (Photo: Getty)\n\nSTEPHEN COLBERT’S NEXT ACT\n\nPink slipped last July by Paramount on a pretty flimsy pretense of cost cutting just before David Ellison took over the CBS-parent company, Stephen Colbert host and the Late Night franchise itself will exit the Ed Sullivan Theater and our small screens in May 2026. No one, maybe even Emmy winner Colbert himself, is saying what will come next.\n\nLooking to be swinging and kicking against the pricks until the very end of his CBS run and clearly not intending to hang up his gloves, Colbert jokingly threw his availability out there in August with a “Netflix, call me. I’m available in June. I will also entertain offers from Amazon.”\n\nNow, with the former about to jump through various regulatory hoops to get the Colbert-hating Trump administration’s approval on its WB deal, and the latter, well, deep in Melanialand, Netflix and Amazon may not be the immediate next act for the Late Nighter. However, perhaps the best indication of where Colbert could end up (and he will end up somewhere) is what the man himself seriously told Deadline’s Peter White a couple of months ago.\n\n“I love creating things and I still want to work with the people I work with. I don’t know how you work with 200 people, 210, something like that, right? It’s an enormous amount of people. I love them. And I want to continue to do that with them to the degree that I can. And I want to find that with other people too.

Earlier this week, after all, he appeared in a promo telling potential viewers that “on too many stories the press missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\nSaturday’s “CBS Evening News” had no direct input from average Americans, and Hegseth, who enjoys a level of power most people in the U.S. do not, could certainly be viewed as “elite.”\n\nDokoupil has many challenges ahead. “CBS Evening News” has run in third place, well behind ABC’s “World News Tonight” and NBC’s “NBC Nightly News,” for years, and its standing has been eroded more in recent months as CBS tested a two-anchor format with Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson that ended up shedding viewers. While NBC has relied on just four anchors for “Nightly News” in about 40 years, CBS keeps swapping them out, moving in Scott Pelley, then Jeff Glor and Norah O’Donnell in just the span of a few years. Such tinkering makes the task of connecting with loyal viewership a more difficult one.\n\nHe has been picked to try and foster new audience ties by Bari Weiss, the recently installed editor in chief of CBS News. She arrived at the Paramount Skydance-backed outlet after it spent a reported $150 million on her opinion site, The Free Press. Weiss has no experience running a mainstream TV-news organization, and in recent weeks, it has begun to show. There have been controversies over a fully-vetted “60 Minutes” report that she ordered held, and people familiar with the newsroom say staffers have grown frustrated that a continued focus on her managerial decisions has taken attention away from serious journalism produced by CBS News reporters. CBS News was early to break news of the Venezeula strikes in the week hours of Saturday morning, as well as key details about some of the planning for the operations.\n\nWeiss hasn’t exactly smoothed the way for her anchor. Dokoupil’s early-January start was unveiled just three weeks ago, giving CBS little time to seed the ground for his arrival. TV network usually spend longer periods of time touting the looming arrival of a new evening anchor, and often send that journalist to meet with executives and staffers at affiliates around the nation, where local anchors are asked to push viewers to the national telecast that follows. Three weeks leaves little time to use outdoor advertising or other promotional tactics to spur interest, and a digital video distributed this week showing Dokoupil striving to get attention from passers-by in Grand Central Terminal did not suggest he was well known.\n\nWith the new anchor’s arrival, CBS has tweaked the look of the venerable program, which has ties to the revered Walter Cronkite. The screen is less cluttered by graphics, distracting the viewer less from what the anchor has to say. Whether Dokoupil would have more detail to offer after a whole day of cable news and broadcast networks’ special reports on the subject, remained to be seen. In the end, CBS News ceded most of its time to Hegseth.\n\nSaturday’s broadcast shouldn’t be seen as “the way it is,” as Cronkite used to say. Dokoupil was supposed to start his run on the program by visiting various U.S. towns and cities. Indeed, he was holding forth at KPIX, CBS’ San Francisco station Saturday evening. He is slated to return to New York for his Monday broadcast, delaying plans that are slated to have him start traveling by the middle of next week.\n\nDokoupil signed off Saturday night with the phrase, “That’s another day in America and the world.” But it was probably not just another day for him, and definitely the start of a longer journey.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:42:36 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T02:35:12.826305"}

Does that mean we are going to see Americans on the corners of Venezuela? In the government of Venezuela? Are you prepared to have troops on the ground in Venezuela?”\n\nHegseth’s answer was not specific.\n\n“It means that we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms, and ultimately he will decide what the iterations are of that.” He later said that Trump “takes nothing on the table, so what happens next will be in the hands of Venezuelans to decide, but ultimately America will benefit, security wise and with prosperity we believe the Venezuelan people can as well.”\n\nDokoupil also asked, “Is it about freedom, or is it about oil? At the press conference today, President Trump seemed to indicate that both were a factor.”\n\nHegseth replied, “Freedom, security, prosperity. Of course what was done by Venezuela against American oil interests and oil companies is well understood and never should have happened. And President Trump is willing to recapture that. But it is also the security of our hemisphere.”\n\nHegseth’s sit down was a rather rare one with a mainstream news outlet, as he has routinely criticized the press since becoming Defense Secretary, and initiated new restrictions that led to the exit of much of the regular Pentagon press corps from the complex.\n\nDokoupil invoked the U.S. invasion of Iraq 20 years ago, which bogged the U.S. down in the region for a decade. “Many of the president’s own supporters tonight are wondering, how is this, this time around, going to be different, and how is it in the U.S. interest?”\n\nHegseth claimed that it was “the exact opposite.” “We spent decades and decades, purchased in blood, and got nothing economically in return.

Miller of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nReconfirming the April 2024 decision of U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson, the unreserved January 2 opinion ruled against the widow and son of Ehud Yonay, who penned “Top Guns” from the now-defunct California magazine’s May 1983 edition. Having sold his work to producers back in the day, Yonay, who died in 2012, was credited in the Reagan Era Top Gun.

Hurwitz, and Jennifer Sung. With the likes of thorn-in-many-a-studio-paw Marc Taboroff and studio go to lawyer Daniel Petrocelli arguing for their respective clients, the trio of Pasadena-based judges heard arguments back in early June.\n\nAdditionally, Judge Miller noted that “the panel held that the district court properly granted summary judgment for Paramount on plaintiffs’ claim that Paramount breached its 1983 agreement with\n\nEhud Yonay by not crediting him in the 2022 movie.”\n\nTom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick (Photo: Paramount Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nOne of a couple of suits that the Joseph Kosinski directed blockbuster has faced since its 2022 release, Shosh Yonay and Yuval Yonay’s breach of contract, declaratory relief, and copyright infringement action claimed “Top Guns” rights reverted to them in January 2020 under copyright statutes.

That means the announcement of a third trip to the animal-filled metropolis can’t be too far off.\n\nLionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid” rose to No. 3 with $15.2 million from 3,070 screens, a barely-there 1% dip from the prior weekend. The R-rated film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has earned an impressive $75.7 million in North America and $133 million worldwide against a $35 million budget.\n\nFourth place went to A24’s “Marty Supreme” with $12.5 million from 2,887 locations, declining just 30% from the post-Christmas frame. So far, the Timothee Chalamet-led ping-pong dramedy has generated $56 million in North America, a great result for the original arthouse release. With those ticket sales, “Marty Supreme” has outgrossed the director Josh Safdie’s prior film “Uncut Gems” ($50 million globally) and ranks among A24’s biggest movies of all time. “Marty Supreme” cost $70 million to produce, making it the most expensive film to date for A24, so it’ll needs to remain a draw into the new year to justify its budget.\n\nSony’s action comedy “Anaconda” remained in fifth place with $10 million from 3,509 theaters, a drop of 31% from the prior weekend. After two weekends of release, the meta reboot of 1997’s “Anaconda, this one starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, has grossed $45.8 million in North America and $88 million globally against a $45 million production budget.\n\nAnother Christmas release, the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue,” slid to the No. 8 spot with $5.87 million from 2,705 venues, a scant 17% drop. So far the tear-jerker, led by Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson as performers in a Neil Diamond cover band, has grossed $25 million domestically and $30 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.\n\nAlthough the year is very young, 2026 is already pacing ahead of 2025 by roughly 30%, according to Comscore. Last year’s revenues hit $8.9 billion across 12 months, a modest 1.5% increase from 2024 though just short of the $9 billion that analysts had expected the industry to generate. As Hollywood prepares to unveil major blockbusters — including “Avengers: Doomsday,” “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” and “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” — will this year’s grosses manage to surpass the elusive $9 billion mark?", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:06:19 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T16:32:21.282121"}

CES this year is inaugurating a partnership with the Cannes Marché du Film and will see an expanded presence for Netflix alongside recent regulars like Disney, Amazon and NBCUniversal.\n\nA tumultuous 2025, which was punctuated by Netflix’s $82.7 billion proposal to acquire the studios-and-streaming division of Warner Bros. Discovery, the ultimate collision of tech and Hollywood, proved that being fluent in tech talk isn’t just a laudable goal. For those in traditional media roles, it could be a survival tactic. And survival is the word when we’re talking about a convention that last year hosted 142,465 attendees.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nParamount Skydance, which is pursuing its own hostile bid for WBD, is backed by Oracle, one of the main combatants in the global AI race. The latest AI wares will be exhibited in Las Vegas, as usual, but there could be a more tangible wow factor this year given that heavy spending by major companies is starting to reach fruition. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities expects tangible effects of companies’ massive investments in AI to be on vivid display.\n\n“The vibe of CES this year is around new chip announcements, AI driven products on the consumer ecosystem, and in essence a new era opening up for companies around the world set to capitalize on $3 trillion to $4 trillion of AI Cap Ex hitting the market over the next 3 years,” Ives wrote in a recent note to clients. “We also expect a growing China tech presence at the show with robotics and smart vehicles (Xpeng-flying car, etc.) some key highlights on the floor. With AI demand accelerating globally and our recent Asia supply chain checks continuing to show unprecedented demand, we view CES this year as kicking off a new AI consumer age as the masses now start to head down this AI Revolution golden path.”\n\nJensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia and a Pied Piper of AI, will deliver his annual keynote on Monday, which is technically the day before the show officially opens. (It wraps up Thursday.)\n\nHuang’s comments are apt to move the market, Ives believes, and Nvidia’s stock (up more than 1,300% in the past five years) attests to his potency as a prognosticator. Nvidia aside, this year’s CES will be “one of the most important moments” for AI of late, in Ives’ view, with recognition now fairly universal that the arrival of AI is a “paradigm shift that is still in the early days of playing out.”\n\nOne new initiative that attests to how the paradigm shift is affecting the film community is a new venture announced last May by Cannes’ Marché du Film and the CTA. They are launching a new innovation award for or companies, startups, entrepreneurs and filmmakers developing transformative tech in filmmaking, production, and distribution.\n\nWhile the creative community is grappling with the implications of AI, advertising has fully embraced the technology.\n\nNetflix’s larger profile at CES, which will see the company host a “speakeasy” happy hour event for advertisers, tech vendors, media members and others, stems from its push into advertising over the past three-plus years. Traditionally, certain highly successful tech companies like Netflix, Apple and others, have eschewed the trappings of giant booths spanning tens of thousands of square feet, leaving that practice to Sony Corp., Samsung, Panasonic and other gadget makers. But as the WBD deal has shown, Netflix is a nearly 30-year-old leopard that is more than willing to change its spots.\n\nMany upfront conversations take root at CES, a fact that has motivated Disney to host a “tech and data showcase” at the show. Amazon Ads, meanwhile, has a large footprint inside the Aria Resort & Casino, which is home base for a range of stakeholders in the ad business. Fox Corp., WBD, NBCU and other sellers of both linear and streaming ads are leaning into tech, with execs speaking on panels before wining and dining clients at night.\n\nAlso inside the Aria, Medialink parent United Talent Agency has a stake in the ground at CES, convening a series of panels about the collision of entertainment and technology under the “Future Decoded” banner.\n\nThe march of technology gives a lot of writers, directors and actors in Hollywood reason for concern, especially with the major above-the-line unions set to start contract negotiations with studios and streamers in the coming weeks. SAG-AFTRA, which has prioritized CES in recent years, co-hosting the Labor, Innovation and Technology Summit with other unions during the Las Vegas show, is recalibrating this year. In place of its Las Vegas presence, the union plans to take other opportunities later in the year to get its message out, along with preparing for the contract talks, which are likely to be as thorny as they were in 2023, when both SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America went on strike.\n\nElsewhere on the CES docket, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and FCC Chair Brendan Carr will conduct “fireside chats” on Thursday morning. Both should be closely tracked given the scrutiny of pending mergers like WBD’s with Netflix or Paramount, as well as Nexstar and Tegna. plus the state of play of a long-discussed breakup of Big Tech titans.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:45:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T16:56:37.503619"}

And when the company does, executives plan to tout not only its ability to help sell goods and services via its large e-commerce portal, but to gain significant reach among consumers, thanks to its streaming content and a growing spate of programmatic alliances it has struck with rivals including Disney, Roku and Netflix, among others.\n\n“At some level, you want to be the ‘everything store’ for advertising,” says Alan Moss, vice president of global sales for Amazon Ads, during a recent interview.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMoss’ willingness to preview Amazon’s plans for CES suggests the company continues to have confidence in its ability to lure new support from Madison Avenue as most video companies move earlier into negotiations ahead of the “upfront,” the annual sales market during which the bulk of TV ad inventory is sold. “We will expand beyond traditional channels and bring more advertisers, especially non-endemics, into our fold,” he says.\n\nAsked what categories of advertisers Amazon need to secure more dollars from, Moss replies: “The simple definition is: those that don’t sell on Amazon.”\n\nAmazon seems poised to put a bigger spotlight on its ability to connect advertisers with bigger audiences. The company has created an enviable suite of DSP agreements that can help advertisers reach both video and audio users of content tied to other companies. The hope is that giving marketers the chance to buy a broader set of programmatic inventory from a single venue might reduce the number of commercials they show to the same consumer and improve the effectiveness of commercials by distributing them with more precision.\n\n“We can now connect advertisers to 90% of all US households, giving us a broad, deterministic reach,” says Moss.\n\nAmazon’s ability to extend reach beyond its own content led it to launch a new “live events optimizer” that enables programmatic advertisers to connect with audiences during heavily watched live moments. These are fast becoming like gold for Madison Avenue stalwarts, who are grappling with a growing number of TV viewers who watch programs at times of their own choosing — in a splintered mass that is harder to reach in an efficient manner. A good chunk of Amazon’s content is watched in such disaggregated fashion, but the company continues to sink millions into sports rights. After winning “Thursday Night Football,” Amazon has now moved on to the NBA, with a new rights deal.\n\nRivals have their own big-ticket events to sell. Disney is expected to use its scheduled telecast of the 2027 Super Bowl to tout a broader series of live events against which it hopes to sell advertising packages. NBCUniversal has a new rights pact with Major League Baseball that will help extend its Sunday-night sports franchise, as well as a bigger celebration tied to the 100th anniversary of its broadcast network.\n\nAmazon has raised eyebrows in recent months among sales executives at many traditional advertisers after its use of sharp elbows in last year’s sales market. Amazon opted to hold a showcase last year on the first night of the industry’s mid-May “upfront week” — a slot that has been used for years by rivals NBCUniversal and Fox for events and meetings with advertisers and buyers.\n\nThe strategy didn’t appear to crimp Amazon’s sales efforts. “We exceeded our own expectations in upfront commitments year over year with new and existing advertisers,” Amazon said in a statement in August, nodding to interest in a new NBA rights pact and series including “Fallout” and “Beast Games.”\n\nAmazon will also spotlight new capabilities powered via A.I. One analyzes a brand’s presence across Amazon’s properties, then “generates creative briefs and storyboards for campaigns,” says Moss.\n\nThere is also a new effort to combine ads that generate awareness and those that help lead to a sale, in a new “full funnel” product expected to debut in the first quarter of 2026. Such an effort might start with “premium streaming TV, audio, then reinforces brand message with display and online video across Amazon in the open internet and completes the conversion, whether it’s on a brand site or with sponsored ads,” Moss explains.\n\nThe economic outlook in recent months has been foggy, with concern about tariffs creating an overhang of sorts on optimistic sentiment. Recent forecasts have called for new reasons for hope in 2026. WPP Media has called for global ad spend in 2026 to increase 7.1%, compared with a previous estimate of 6.1%. One of the factors cited is a raft of new products and services created by A.I., leading to new firms that need to advertise.\n\n“To some extent the uncertainty is a little bit of the new normal,” Moss says, adding: “No matter the economic climate, advertisers are focused on using advertising where it’s most likely to achieve their desired business goals, whether that’s awareness, consideration, or diversion.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T17:25:14.294118"}

Instead, the series borrows a time-honored setup from “Schitt’s Creek,” infinite Hallmark movies and its own source material, the long running British series “Doc Martin”: uptight big city professional gets reluctantly acquainted with the charms of small-town life. In this case, the titular curmudgeon — yes, the name is a pun and the character is called Doctor Best — is played by erstwhile “The Good Wife” star Josh Charles, whose cantankerous charm keeps the sometimes forced-feeling zaniness in check through the first four episodes.\n\n“Best Medicine” takes place in a corner of coastal Maine currently best known to outsiders from Graham Platner campaign ads. (Ironically, this celebration of the country’s quieter corners was developed by Liz Tuccillo, an alumna of the quintessentially urban “Sex and the City” and co-author of the hit self-help book “He’s Just Not That Into You.”) Charles’ Boston heart surgeon used to vacation there as a kid, and returns when a childhood trauma-triggering incident at work gives him an occupationally hazardous fear of blood. Conveniently, the town doctor has just passed away, giving Martin — inheriting a first name from his English predecessor — a new job and a chance to work on his abysmal bedside manner.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMartin wants nothing more than to diagnose his patients, treat their illnesses and move on with his day. Unfortunately for him, that’s not really the gig, as he learns the hard way when one woman’s use of estrogen cream to treat symptoms of perimenopause accidentally reveals her infidelity. (Both her male partners develop breasts due to estrogen contact. It’s called gynecomastia!) Dr. Best is more like a communal therapist, expected to be on call at all times to consult whatever minor problems his new neighbors may be working through, strictly medical in nature or not — “like the world is one giant doctor’s office,” he laments.\n\nEvery episode of “Best Medicine” establishes a new yet equally beloved local tradition to confound the fiercely anti-sentimental doctor: a baked bean dinner; a high-school baseball game against archrivals Bar Harbor; a handsome hermit who comes out of the woods once a year to teach the local ladies wilderness survival skills. Martin’s no-nonsense aunt Joan (Annie Potts), incompetent assistant Elaine (the mononymous actor Cree) and partner in will-they-won’t-they flirtation Louisa (Abigail Spencer), a teacher, serve as his guides through these local rituals. These women are flanked by an ever-expanding cast of quirk-forward local characters, from the gay couple who own a local restaurant and let their pet pig wander the kitchen to a father-and-son handyman duo who like to make unsolicited repairs.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s a relief that “Best Medicine” feels like the first rural-set story in half a decade to make no mention of the opioid crisis. But as endearing as these Maine denizens may be — like Louisa’s ex-fiancé Mark, played by Hollywood’s go-to funny himbo Josh Segarra — they collectively lack edge in a way that’s less than convincing. Lip service is paid to the decline of small towns, yet any contributing factors to that shift are ignored in the name of an insistently sunny (literally; no snow here!) disposition. Martin’s former bully Glen (Patch Darragh) has the makings of a villain before he’s swiftly reformed. Mark briefly flirts with manosphere-style aggrievement, but anger doesn’t suit him.\n\nAny hint of acid comes from Martin himself, a necessary counterpoint to the sugar in such abundant supply. “I’m not meant to be a town doctor because I don’t like people,” he complains, but Charles doesn’t play the physician as mean-spirited or even especially irritable. Martin just has little patience or understanding of social niceties, which happen to be the stock and trade of his new home: “I find the people demanding, irrational and far too chatty at supermarkets,” he sighs. To invoke another iconic TV doctor from the same network, Martin’s like a less gleefully bitchy Dr. House, a parallel that extends to his penchant for solving diagnostic mysteries like the source of a seemingly foodborne illness.\n\nMartin will doubtless have his edges sanded down over time, though hopefully later rather than sooner. For now, the contrast between Martin and his patients has a productive friction that gives Charles plenty of grouchy misanthropy to work with. Amid so much communitarian sweetness, a spoonful of bitter helps “Best Medicine” go down.\n\n“Best Medicine” premieres on Fox on Jan. 4 at 8 p.m. ET, with remaining episodes airing Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET starting on Jan. 6.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 18:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T18:37:37.681685"}

It features the eponymous CIA analyst Jack Ryan (John Krasinski) breaking down why Venezuela should be considered “a major threat on the world stage” alongside — and even over — usual suspects such as Russia, China and North Korea.\n\n“The fact is that Venezuela is arguably the single greatest resource of oil and minerals on the planet,” Ryan says in the scene after listing the Latin American country as having the largest oil deposit in the world as well as more gold than all the mines in Africa combined. “So why is this country in the midst of one of the greatest humanitarian crises in modern history?”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHe focuses on the country’s fictional President who “has crippled the national economy by half” and “has raised the poverty rate by almost 400%.”\n\nRyan also points out that, unlike other countries that have faced economic collapse such as Yemen and Iraq, Venezuela is “within 30-minute range from the US of next-gen nuclear missiles.”\n\nSocial media users have praised the six-year-old clip, which you can watch below, for explaining well the current Venezuela situation.\n\nThe parallels are not lost on Carlton Cuse, who co-created Jack Ryan with Graham Roland and served as showrunner for the first two seasons.\n\n“What always surprises you as a storyteller is how often real-world events catch up to fiction,” he told Deadlime. “The goal of that season wasn’t prophecy — it was plausibility.

We approached Venezuela as a country where democratic ideals, economic reality, and geopolitical interests have been in tension for a long time — and where choices are never simple.”\n\nAs for potentially looking into the future, “the season came from our desire to tell a fictional story about the forces at play, not from imagining an outcome,” Cuse said.\n\nSpeaking of the outcome, there are some similarities between the culmination of Jack Ryan‘s second season and the real-live events of this weekend as the fictional Venezuelan president on the show also gets removed after Ryan and the Venezuela CIA Station Chief fly a helicopter into the Presidential Palace.\n\nBut in the series, they confront the corrupt President who is exposed, with the opposition winning the election.

After del Toro won the Golden Globe for best director, he came straight to Johnson, hugged him and exclaimed, “We did it!”\n\n“And I went, ‘We did do it!’ and I’ll never forget that, and everyone after that was coming up to me and congratulating me,” Johnson laughed.\n\nJohnson was honored for playing MMA fighter Mark Kerr in “The Smashing Machine,” saying, “It changed my life in ways that I didn’t anticipate, discovering things about myself.”\n\nJohnson spoke about Kerr, who had overdosed twice, the toll of drug addiction and dealing with pressure. He counts 15 friends he has lost who died from drugs or suicide. He said. “This role gave me a greater level of empathy…and the realization that, you know who is really going through something right now? Everyone. We’re all going through it.”\n\n“This one goes out to everyone who’s going through it and who’s fighting,” Johnson concluded.\n\nTeyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti at Variety‘s Creative Impact Awards and 10 Directors to Watch Brunch. Michael Buckner/Variety\n\nTeyana Taylor was introduced by her “One Battle After Another” co-star Chase Infiniti, who said her role as Perfidia Beverly Hills “truly burned a hole through the screen.”\n\nTaylor said that 20 years into her career, being celebrated as a breakthrough “feels a little ironic.” She gave a shoutout to her two young daughters at her table, exclaiming, “Are you on your phone?”\n\nSpeaking about her decision to retire from music five years ago because she felt boxed in, she compared herself to a Glade plug-in scent. “Why only plug me in a bathroom, when I can make the whole room smell good?”\n\n“You’re going to plug me in every single outlet! I want to take up every square foot!,” she said. “There have been so many incredible directors I’ve been fortunate to work with, but none as impactful as Paul Thomas Anderson.” Taylor is preparing to direct her first feature film, she said.\n\nOscar Isaac introduced del Toro, saying in Guillermo’s cinema, “transformation is constant,” adding he has “redefined what genre cinema can be” and brings “poetry to horror.”\n\nDel Toro spoke about his “religious experience” as a child when he first saw James Whale’s “Frankenstein,” and then said he was very grateful to have Sara Karloff, daughter of the iconic “Frankenstein” star, as his guest at the brunch.\n\n“Sometimes the world gets so complicated, you can only explain it with the power of monsters,” he said. “We are in a time like that right now.”\n\n“A director has to have two skins — a thick one for the business and the world, and a thin one for their collaborators and their heart,” del Toro said, lobbing pithy quotes one after another.\n\n“It’s not just the size of the screens, it’s the size of the idea,” he continued. “Ambition includes failure – it’s right next door to success. There are no numbers on the door. You’re going to knock on that door, and it’s going to open, and it’s either a supermodel of your dreams or your mom in curlers.”\n\nHe directed his next remarks to the Variety 10 Directors to Watch table, saying, “Be kind, be involved, believe in your art. At a time when people tell you art is not important, that is always a prelude to fascism. They think they can debase everything that makes us a little better, a little more human. And that, in my book, and in my life, includes monsters.”\n\nVariety chief film critic Peter Debruge introduced this year’s 10 Directors to Watch, explaining that honoree Dave Green is stuck in Puerto Rico due to flight restrictions. All the filmmakers except Green and Harry Lighton were present at the brunch.\n\nThe directors to watch are Akinola Davies Jr. (“My Father’s Shadow”); Beth de Araujo (“Josephine”); Jan-Ole Gerster (“Islands”); Sarah Goher (“Happy Birthday”); Dave Green (“Coyote vs. Acme”); Chandler Levack (“Mile End Kicks”); Harry Lighton (“Pillion”); NB Mager (“Run Amok”); Kristen Stewart (“The Chronology of Water”) and Walter Thompson-Hernández (“If I Go Will They Miss Me”).", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 20:29:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T20:48:18.245821"}

The GoFundMe, titled “Help Mickey Rourke Stay in His Home,” has raised $5,290 so far with a goal of $100,000.\n\n“Mickey Rourke entered American cinema like a force of nature—raw, fearless, and utterly original,” reads the donation page description. “In the late 1970s and 1980s, he wasn’t just a movie star; he was a symbol of something rare: danger paired with vulnerability, toughness paired with heart. From ‘Diner’ to ‘Rumble Fish’ to ‘9½ Weeks’, Mickey gave audiences performances that felt lived-in, not performed, and left a permanent mark on American film culture.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe blurb goes on to say that after Rourke stepped away from acting for boxing, he was burdened with “lasting physical and emotional scars” and abandoned by “the industry that once celebrated him.”\n\n“Fame does not protect against hardship, and talent does not guarantee stability,” the description adds. “What remains is a person who deserves dignity, housing, and the chance to regain his footing.”\n\nRourke’s major breakout was Francis Ford Coppola’s 1983 drama “Rumble Fish.” His other notable credits include “The Pop of Greenwich Village,” “9½ Weeks,” “Angel Heart” and “Barfly,” as well as more recent films like “Man on Fire,” “Sin City” and “The Wrestler.”\n\nRourke was recently attached to a new independent thriller, “Mascots,” written and directed by Kerry Mondragon. However, Udo Kier, who died in November 2025, was supposed to co-star, so it is unclear how the production will proceed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 21:18:22 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T21:42:56.933284"}

With the change, the report will take over a previous slot at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT, following the NFL game between the Washington Commanders and Philadelphia Eagles tonight.\n\nPreviously, the timeslot was held by the newsmagazine’s coverage of Boom Chicago, an in-the-know improv comedy space in Amsterdam; the program will now air at a later date.\n\n\n\nThe 60 Minutes segment, titled “Maduro,” will explore the aftereffects of the U.S. military’s overnight strike on Venezuela and capture of its president and his wife, Cilia Flores. Correspondent Scott Pelley reports on the international maelstrom and the criminal charges the couple faces, which include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States. The CBS News reporter interviews former DEA special agent Sandy Gonzalez, who helped lead the investigation that led to Maduro’s 2020 indictment; Roger Carstens, who was Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs under the previous Trump and Biden administrations; and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz).\n\nMaria Gavrilovic, Aaron Weisz, Nicole Young and Pat Milton produce the segment.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nIn the early morning hours Saturday, President Donald Trump oversaw strikes on Venezuelan soil in a proposed invasion of the South American nation. After toppling its leader, the POTUS has indicated his advisers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, would be tasked with running the country.\n\nAs reasoning for the non-Congressionally approved move, Trump has cited Venezuela’s rich oil reserves and its alleged role in drug trafficking to the U.S. The tactical decision has drawn harsh criticism and protests for its dubious legality, as some Democrats have branded the military incident an Iraq War deja vu. The Senate is prepared to vote next week on a bipartisan war powers resolution to block the GOP leader from continuing his offensive in Venezuela.\n\nIn a new interview with recently minted CBS Evening News permanent anchor Tony Dokoupil, Hegseth remained vague about the government’s future plans and continued involvement in Venezuela; he maintained the rapidly unfolding situation was “the exact opposite” of the costly and unnecessary Iraq invasion and stated Congress will be “involved” moving forward. The DOD official also insisted Maduro’s capture did not necessitate informing the legislative branch, but was rather a “law enforcement exercise.”\n\nTonight, 60 Minutes will also air its programs as previously scheduled, including “Here Come the Humanoids,” about AI-powered and human-like robots, and a segment about record-breaking U.S. women’s figure skating champ and 2026 Olympic gold favorite Alysa Liu.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:40:42 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-04T22:46:18.267059"}

When they tell you it doesn’t matter, when they tell you a fucking app can do art you say, if it’s that important, why the fuck do they want it so bad? The answer is because they think they can debase everything that makes us a little better, a little more human. And that, in my book, and in my life, includes monsters.”\n\nAlong with del Toro, who received the Directing Award for his work on “Frankenstein,” other honorees included Dwayne Johnson, who received the Creative Impact in Acting Award for “The Smashing Machine,” and Teyana Taylor, who received the Creative Impact in Breakthrough Performance Award for “One Battle After Another.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nElsewhere in his speech, del Toro spoke about the “religious experience” of watching James Whale’s 1931 “Frankenstein” for the first time. Sara Karloff, the daughter of the original “Frankenstein” star Boris Karloff, was his guest at the event.\n\n“Sometimes the world gets so complicated, you can only explain it with the power of monsters,” he said. “We are in a time like that right now.”\n\nHe later added, “It’s not just the size of the screens, it’s the size of the idea. Ambition includes failure – it’s right next door to success. There are no numbers on the door. You’re going to knock on that door, and it’s going to open, and it’s either a supermodel of your dreams or your mom in curlers.”\n\n“Frankenstein” was released on Netflix on Oct. 17, 2025.

Between the two of them, Mayer may have spent the greatest amount of time thinking about the scents associated with the landmark Hollywood property, which they jointly purchased for a reported $44 million just over a year ago.\n\n“I’ve asked a lot over the years about this: I don’t know what makes an old California studio smell like an old California studio,” Mayer says. “You cannot fake the smell. Ocean Way [the classic Hollywood recording studio] had it. The medical buildings in Beverly Hills, those green-carpet kind of medical buildings, have it. You walk in and you go, “I don’t know why Mickey Fine smells like that’,” he says, referring to the historic pharmacy. “I don’t know why the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge smells like it does. But if you have that classic California smell, keep it! Because you cannot buy it. There is no candle.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMayer’s attention to the aromatic qualities of a historic property has apparently made an impression on McG, too, because even he raises the issue, when he discusses the day-to-day decisions that have been made over the last 10 months about what to renovate and what to leave alone for fear of affecting the all-important vibes that have accumulated over the last 110 years.\n\n“It’s still a work in progress,” says McG, the filmmaker behind “Charlie’s Angels” and “Terminator Salvation,” who is especially in charge of the parts of the lot that involve film/TV production and offices. “I was telling John a lot of the buildings are built like film sets. I remember getting the reports, where there would be gaps in a window where the breeze will come in, and someone is like, ‘For God’s sake, a spider could crawl through! You gotta seal those windows.’ And I’m just like, if I seal it, that California smell might be erased. I can’t do that. So you’ve gotta lean into the Wabi-sabi funk of this place, or you’re in the wrong place.”\n\n“I think that’s a great point,” agrees Mayer. “How do you thread the needle between that lived-in thing and looking forward and acknowledging modern-day? That’s something I try to do all the time. What are the best of both worlds, and what is great and sturdy about the past? What can you interlace in a way that doesn’t hold back the future and just gives it a little more strength and durability? And that’s what we’re having fun doing.”\n\nSentiments like these will be music to the ears of the many Southern Californians who look to Chaplin — or to A&M, or Henson, or however they grew up knowing it best — as a hopefully immutable touchstone of both the city of Los Angeles and its entertainment community. Whether you’re a historic preservationist or just a nostalgist, chances are you have some strong feelings about the lot, especially if you’ve worked or frequently visited there. Mayer and McG have not talked openly about their plans until now, but they met with a small group of journalists last month to first tour the lot, then sit down in Studio B talk at length about the property’s history and possibilities.\n\nOne of the things they are discussing for the first time publicly is how the sale came to be, and how they came to be in on it together, not having previously been buddies or even acquaintances up until this became a joint mission. They also addressed the widespread reports that Scientology was set to acquire the property, which did not sit entirely well with an entertainment community that had become accustomed to the lot being open for a wide variety of usages over the decades.\n\n“John and I strangely don’t know each other all that well prior to our arranged marriage,” acknowledges McG. “I was sort of trying to take a run at it. I’d gotten to know Faryal (Ganjehei, the lot’s president and studio manager since 2000], and John kicked the tires for his purposes and tried to figure it out. And I just didn’t have enough dough, and I don’t think he wanted to deal with the headache. Then we finally got together and I was like, ‘I’m equipped to deal with the headache’ [of overseeing the entire lot]. He’s like, ‘Good. I want to tunnel into the [recording] studio and tunnel back out.’ And I go, ‘Perfect!’ And Irving Azoff gave me my first record deal in the ‘90s” — (McG was one of Sugar Ray’s primary instigators and had his own imprint before becoming one of the top musid video directors of that decade) — “and we had a very good experience with that, and he obviously manages John. So Irving vouched for both of us: Chocolate, meet peanut butter. Reese’s, knock yourself out.”\n\nBut McG approached the possibility of a deal first as a solo act. “I even got it into escrow,” he reveals, “but I couldn’t close it; I didn’t have enough dough. This is before John. And I don’t know if we should talk about our competition…,” he wonders aloud. “I think [Henson] got way downstream with a family with deep ties to the Church of Scientology, and then that got out in public, and people were concerned about the manner in which it was going to be deployed. I’ll leave it at that. And then we got our foot back in the door and got our financial ducks in a row, and we were fortunate enough to make it happen.”\n\nMcG and John Mayer at Chaplin Studios Brecht Van’t Hof\n\nMayer was coming from a place of having recorded at the A&M studios going back to 2005, and having locked in Studio C for his own purposes in 2018, getting to know the people who worked there. “I’ll piggyback off what McG said. It was in the press; it’s known. But it wasn’t necessarily about anyone else who was in the running. For me, this was about keeping the band together And all I really cared about was in my sort of near view, which is: This is a gang you can spend another 30 years working with. It would’ve really upset me deeply if everyone who comes to work every day and sees one another — it’s a very tightknit family — had to separate and dissipate, and I went and worked at one studio, and Faryal went and started somewhere in the middle of the ladder at another studio. I did not want to see all of us go different places. That’s it.\n\n“This was not about outsmarting anybody. This is about caring about so many people who see each other every day …. especially if you’re me and you’re an artist, and you don’t have any semblance of routine in your life, and I found it, like other artists find it here. … This is one of those times in life where you throw down for what matters, not for what you can brag about you were able to corner someone on… At a certain point… I know I said to the previous owners, ‘You have my attention, and I’m not here to play games anymore. And what does it take?’ And to have an emotional asset in your life is a really good thing. I think everyone’s always looking at assets from a very objective, hardcore, empirical value level. This is something I wake up and go to sleep every day knowing in my heart that I have a piece of in some way, or I’m responsible for other people’s piece of it.”\n\nSays McG: “I’m old enough to have seen the exodus of aerospace out of Southern California — [it] broke my heart — and old enough to have seen the exodus of Hollywood out of Southern California. So if we could take a small step in the direction of planting a flag and saying, ‘Hey, we’re trying to do the right thing and protect the people of the city that we care about, trying to show that you can make a film or television show or record and do it here with extraordinary people and extraordinary facilities’ — why not?”\n\nWith an estimated $9 million going into renovating the property and its facilities, on top of the substantial purchase price, no one is expecting it to be a profitable investment soon. They’re fine with that.\n\n“John makes a really good point about the dough,” McG says, “because I think a lot of financial people kicked us in the shins and said, ‘Not such a hot financial idea.’ And we just kind of shrugged because it was always emotional. It’s well-known that John is a premiere watch collector and a giant voice in that community. And I kind of wrapped my head around, if John buys a very interesting watch, it doesn’t pay a dividend; I’m sure his business manager told him he overpaid for it, all those things… But he gets to live with the watch, enjoy the watch, take it out for a test spin, do the thing, enjoy it. And it’s very likely to go from the value of one to the value of two over the course of time, even in the absence of making prudent financial sense. So I think that you’ve gotta look at it like one of John’s watches, if you will.”\n\n“Yeah, it would be one of my watches that I love wearing more than I care about the P&L or what the books say it is,” agrees Mayer. “You don’t hear, as you’re scrolling through on line, about making a contribution in some way — having something in your name that is less about a portfolio and more about having a piece of something and having a part in preserving something. There are people in L.A. who have never needed a recording studio and will never need to come here, who are going to be very happy that a building in L.A. that was known as one thing has changed hands and will continue to be known as the same thing.”\n\nChaplin Studios, formerly A&M and Henson Studios Brecht Van’t Hof\n\nAre there other major investors that McG and Mayor will need to answer to as they steer the lot toward a hoped-for profit someday?\n\n“We didn’t really look up each other’s pant leg,” says McG. “We split it right down the middle. I brought in a couple of friends to help offset [some of the down payment]. My nephew gave me a couple bucks… It was a lot of money for me. We had to put down a lot cash to make the deal work… We all became sort of blinded with desire just to get it done at the end there. But we got it done and, at the end of the day, what matters most is, it’s dually John and McG.”\n\n“Yeah, I mean, I think it’s just you and I on the paperwork,” says Mayer.\n\n“Yeah, there’s no ‘And therefore we also have to check with the big Daddy Warbucks character.’ It’s truly just us,” McG says.\n\n“I have a food truck business,” adds Mayer. “I just went into that … used my profits from the food truck.” As is sometimes the case with him, it takes a couple of beats to realize he’s kidding.\n\nThe two co-owners got almost everything they wanted in procuring the lot — with a couple of symbolic exceptions that were denied by the property’s last two sets of owners. They were not allowed to use the A&M name, and the statue of Kermit dressed as Charlie Chaplin that had towered over the LaBrea front entrance for 25 years was carted off to go to a museum, despite a vociferous case being made to leave the frog where he stood.\n\n“The Hensons took the Kermit dressed as the Tramp and put it in a museum in Atlanta that’s dedicated to Jim Henson, which I think is terribly sad for the people of Los Angeles,” McG says. “I’ve always made it analogous to, like, if we all owned Randy’s Donuts, but we sold it to the barbecue place, I think between us and the barbecue person, just leave the donut up there… Griffith Park Observatory, Formosa Cafe, the Hollywood sign — we don’t have that much, so don’t keep cannibalizing and chipping away. A woman I work with takes her kids to school every day on this road, and she says, ‘My kids every day would say, “What’s up, Kerms?” Now, they don’t.’ And it breaks my heart, and I think that it’s an opportunity missed. I think it transcends the Henson family, respectfully, and transcends John or McG or anybody. I feel like at a certain point it belongs to the city, and I’m very sad to see it go. Oh well.”\n\nWhen it came to renaming the facility from Henson Studios, there were issues of whether to go back in time and, if so, how far back.\n\nSays McG, “My company’s called Wonderland Sound and Vision, and of course, John’s breakout hit is ‘Your Body Is a Wonderland’…”\n\n“And my best song to date, by the way,” interjects Mayer, tongue firmly in cheek.\n\nMcG: “So a woman I work a lot with goes, ‘Are you guys gonna call it Your Body Is a Wonderland Sound and Vision? And I’m like, no.”\n\nAnother idea: “People for a long time were saying, just call it J&M,” Mayer notes. Another immediate no.\n\n“But we even took a run at just, ‘Hey, should we call it A&M?’” says McG. “Because I’m of a generation where I just regard this as A&M. I used to hang out on the docks begging everybody for CDs, so I associate it with that period. But there were problems with Universal Music Group being proprietary about this, that and the other.” Technically, A&M is part of a current label name — Interscope Geffen A&M — which represents some of the imprints that Universal bought and absorbed, although at this point the A&M part is more of a faintly nostalgic technicality than a distinct entity with any connection to the house that Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss built. “They just couldn’t see it,” says a frustrated Mayer. “They had A&M Records. This would’ve been A&M Studios. Two nodes… They couldn’t get it.”\n\nBut sometimes simpler is better (as anyone who has ever had to wrap their tongues around Interscope Geffen A&M can attest), and “Chaplin” is pretty simple.\n\n“It’s difficult to correctly launch the narrative of a new brand in 2026,” Mayer says. “And if you take any name you have in mind for a studio and put the word ‘studio’ after it, it exists online… It’s very hard to find a (new) name for a studio that still has vowels in it… What I liked about Chaplin is, it is a 100-year-old brand, and there’s this second life to it. I thought this could be really interesting, to have people in their twenties who are working on their first album go to a place called Chaplin, even if they’re not aware of what the connection is. How can you get those who understand the legendary contributions Charlie Chaplin made to film understand it, and have a new cohort of artists just see a name that looks and sounds good, hoping that at some point people go, ‘I didn’t know there was a person behind Chaplin’? You don’t go to buy a Ford Raptor and interface so much with Henry Ford and his legacy. But it’s important to keep legacies alive. I think it’s cooler to have it exist in a constant but very low-grade way, so that you have just kind of a pinky locked on it, but move forward.”\n\nA tour of the facility establishes that everything still around on the lot that has any connection to Chaplin’s era, which extended from 1917 through 1953, is being carefully preserved… except in cases of pure dry rot being uncovered.\n\nStanding out in front of the La Brea entrance on the exterior sidewalk, McG says, “We started to redo everything in the spirit of getting it exactly like it was when Chaplin built it. We did the research with the width of the strip oak that he put in for the hardwood floors and replaced them.” In front, “We chipped off the paint and we got the original colors from when Chaplin did it and did the analytics, so it was the exact brown and the exact white. We did all the landscaping to make it more beautiful for the forward-facing part of La Brea, just trying to give back to the city, since there’s a lot of blight around here, and we’re just trying to be a moment of light in that. And these wooden buildings are historically protected” — but not necessarily in the exact spots they were in the 1910s. “When they widened La Brea, they had to put ’em on logs and push ’em back.”\n\nMcG points out features on a vintage overhead view of the A&M/Henson lot, now Chaplin Studios Chris Willman/Variety\n\nSigns of Chaplin’s reign remain within. On a tour of the buildings, for instance, Ganjehei shows off a furnace where the silent film legend used to burn outtakes, after examining dailies in his screening room right across the front entrance. Some of Chaplin’s footprints remain in cement in an inner courtyard. In McG’s own office, there are stained glass windows that apparently date back to when Chaplin held court there. “A few years back, there was a really bad car accident on LaBrea, and the fire hydrant went up and the water destroyed the wall, and when we knocked down the wall for the repair work, these windows were discovered. So it’s so beautiful that Mc G is now including it in his office,” Ganjehei says. The director says that other glass windows will be replaced with Mondrian-style glass to match the original.\n\nThere are other artifacts or entire buildings that remain from the silent era. On the slightly tawdry side, the studio overseer points to a mostly out-of-sight loft where “rumor has it that that’s where Chaplin would keep his concubines of sorts.” Chaplin’s original grooming and makeup chair sits near the entrance to Studio A. Down the hall, there is a table with books perched on it that propped up a studio saw a hundred years ago, still branded with the “C.C. Film Co.” logo. In the building still called “the mill,” is “apparently the oldest standing saw, minus the blades, in the West,” Ganjehei says. All this woodworking talk leads to anecdotes about how, in the A&M era, there would be shout-outs about “needing the carpenters,” only for Richard and Karen Carpenter to answer the call.\n\nDetail of Charlie Chaplin-era woodsaw table at the Chaplin Studios Chris Willman/Variety\n\nCharlie Chaplin’s makeup chair, on display at the Chaplin Studios Chris Willman/Variety\n\nMost of the footprint of the lot remains as it has been since the late ‘60s, when Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert bought it and transformed two of the three soundstages to five recording studios. Each of these six spaces where music or video productions are made has its own history.\n\nThe recording studios continued to be made available to outsiders during the quarter-century Henson had the place, while the soundstage was mostly utilized for Henson’s own kids’ shows, with exceptions.\n\nLately, the giant stage has been used for everything from “Knives Out: Wake Up Dead Man” pickup shots to a Stella McCartney fashion show to a benefit concert Mayer and his band did for a veterans’ charity. They have been looking at what kind of event should be held there during Grammy Week.\n\n“I want it to be the kind of place where, if the event is happening here, the address is the pull to go,” says Mayer. “That might sound a little superficial, but I think that’s an interesting way to create a goal. Can the address become ‘Ooh, there’s a thing at Chaplin. It doesn’t matter what it is. That’s a cool place to go hang.’”\n\nChaplin Studios Brecht Van’t Hof\n\nThere are more outdoor chairs and tables, and more greenery and fountains, to “soften” the facility… not that everyone didn’t already just dig a nice bungalow. McG has gotten down into the dirt to do some of the planting himself,\n\n“What you see with these gardens and stuff… for me, the whole impetus of this place was, everywhere we shoot, literally around the world, when it’s wrapped, you’re like,’How fast can we get the fuck outta here?’” says the filmmaker. “Here, when you finish your work, it’s like, ‘Do you want a glass of wine? Do you wanna hang out and talk a little bit?’ And I find that so magical.”\n\nYou will not find Mayer literally getting into the dirt, himself. Although if you are in one of the studios and you happen to need a guitar part, and you come across Mayer in the hallway, he might oblige you, without getting bogged down in whatever is involved in taking a credit.\n\nAs for whether there is a need for this kind of advanced studio anymore, when home studios are capable of so much in the 2020s, Mayer has an answer: “It’s work from home versus working from the office. And I think it’s cool to hedge your bet on the side of humanity.”\n\nThat’s why they haven’t made any major renovations to the structure or look, especially, of the recording studios, knowing that part of the appeal is being able to go into the exact room — Studio C — where Joni Mitchell recorded “Blue” and several other albums. Mitchell came by the studio last month, to revisit the scene of the crime at a holiday party, and was no doubt pleased to see that it’s Henry Diltz photos of her that everyone who comes in first sees, establishing a Laurel Canyon vibe.\n\n“If artists walked in and immediately everything was LED back-lit…” says Mayer, letting that distasteful thought trail off. “There’s a nomenclature to being in the studio that lives in its own timeframe, and you just let people relate to that still. Even the tapestries… there’s just something about tapestries and string lights that make people want to write songs, even if it’s not the most modern, Tesla-fied thing.”\n\nGanjehel, the studio manager, will happily reel off past recordings of yore: The largest studio, A, can handle a 45-piece orchestra, and has been home to everything from vintage Burt Bacharach, Alpert and Sergio Mendes recordings to Guns N’ Roses’ “Use Your Illusions” projects to five out of the last six Paul McCartney albums to Justin Bieber’s recent “Swag” (volumes one and two). The smaller Studio D, on the other end of the hallway, has hosted the Doors, U2, Fleetwood Mac, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, Miley Cyrus and the last two Harry Styles albums.\n\nBut don’t ever imagine the studio manager is ever going to give up who is currently woriing in the studio. “We don’t kiss and tell,” she says. Not even to major rock stars or a co-owner.\n\n“Lady Gaga a couple years ago was recording in Studio B, and the Stones were in studio A and D,” she recalls. “Mick Jagger comes up and says, ‘I hear Lady Gaga’s here.’ And we respond with, ‘We don’t discuss who’s here.’ But the bodyguards made it happen. Lady Gaga was sitting on this couch and I said, ‘Mick asked if you were here, but everything is so private and confidential and we really, really value that.’ And she said, ‘You can always tell Mick Jagger when I’m here.’ She recorded that duet with them [“Sweet Sounds of Heaven,” from their 2023 “Hackney Diamonds” album] two hours later.”\n\nSays Mayer, talking about the years before he bought the lot, “Faryal never let me know who else was here. And you might say that my half of this place was worth paying just to get the calendar every day, being let behind that very iron curtain of who was in the building every day, I’m still not over it, I don’t think.”\n\n“May I add, I’m not behind that iron curtain,” McG protests. “As recently as yesterday, Faryal was chewing my ear off because there was a truck loading in something, and she goes, ‘I have an artist coming’,” but she wouldn’t say who. “I’m shooting a fucking nude scene with Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy — I can handle the discretion of who the artist is! But I don’t say anything and I honor the code. So when I’ve earned it, that’ll be a hell of a day and I’ll definitely elbow John, like, ‘She let me in, dude.’”\n\nChaplin Studios’ soundstage Brecht Van’t Hof\n\nWith Bieber no longer on the premises, they can acknowledge press reports of an unusual recent request that made use of the large soundstage for a non-filming purpose.\n\nSays Mayer, “Faryal wrote me one Saturday morning: ‘Hey, Justin’s gonna be in the studio. He mentioned wanting a basketball court. What do you think about turning the soundstage into a basketball court for him?” I said, ‘Great, but I don’t know that you can do that.’ Two or three hours later on that night, I get an image of what looks like a perfect basketball court with a three-point line and a foul line and everything, all done with tape. The runners had figured out how to do it.”\n\nAs for whether whims like that need to be indulged, Mayer, perhaps not surprisingly, is on the side of the talent. “I staunchly defend artists both as being more normal than you think and way more screwed up than you think. And I try to protect the best parts of both of ’em. So if Justin Bieber had something that you could hear on ‘Swag’ that was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys because he was able to shoot a little hoops on a break, then we’ve done our job.”\n\nThe match of personalities between Mayer and McG has been a good one, they avow, after 10 months of working together tightly, as two guys who both talk very fast and who can both use big words like “nomenclature” while talking that fast. To say nothing of shared ambitions.\n\n“I like high-octane personalities,” says Mayer. “I think it’s fair to say, McG, you have a high-octane personality. I have somewhat of a high-octane personality. And I know how to weave in and out of that, and I know how to let someone else rip when it’s time to rip.”\n\nMcG and John Mayer at the Chaplin Studios Chris Willman/Variety\n\nPreservation was far from their only reason for acquiring the Chaplin Studios, but it’s neither negligible nor ignoble as a factor.\n\nSays McG, “I hope that organically it will be revealed: Oh, that was the tenure where John and McG were the torch bearers and hopefully will be regarded as they did a good job and they threw down for Los Angeles. They put their money where their mouth was. I love what Jason Reitman did with the Village Westwood theater, where he got a consortium of superheroes to kind of come in and save it. It’s like, we don’t need another six-story mixed-use. They’re not cool… We really should take a look at what made Los Angeles great and be of a mind that those things don’t grow on trees and not everything is disposable.”\n\nMayer has his own take on that. “I wonder if at some point, like 10 years from now, someone who’s gonna be 30 will stand outside of Supreme [the clothing store that moved into Tower Records’ old Sunset building] as it’s being closed down and go, ‘You just can’t keep anything good these days.’ They probably will, because I do think that probably every generation thinks that their thing is the thing that matters the most — except this building has five generations. So I think if you can [hold onto it], you should, right?”\n\n(More details about the lot can be found here, with specific information about the soundstage here and the recording studios here.)\n\nChaplin Studios Brecht Van’t Hof", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 02:28:24 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T02:31:30.141534"}

Downs had some fun on the Critics Choice Awards red carpet on Sunday afternoon as the pair donned bright orange vinyl outfits in a spoof of the outfits that Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner wore to the premiere of Chalamet’s new film “Marty Supreme.”\n\nStalter and Downs had the crowd howling with their commitment to the bit. Downs wore a ping pong paddle on a strap, crossbag style. Stalter sported a gigantic cross necklace reminiscent of Jenner’s necklace at the Dec. 17 premiere in New York. Set in the 1950s, “Marty Supreme” revolves around an everyday man’s quest to become the world champion of ping pong. Chalamet and his girlfriend Jenner turned heads last month with their bright-orange outfits, extending the orange theme that has been used in marketing the A24 film.\n\nDowns, who is also a co-creator and executive producer of “Hacks” with Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky, said the goal was to “have fun” and enjoy themselves at the awards. “Hacks” is nominated for best comedy series and Downs is up for comedy supporting actor at Critics Choice, which recognize film and TV. Chalamet and “Marty Supreme” are also nommed.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“We get to see people who make movies we love. We just thought, ‘Let’s have fun,'” Downs told Variety on the carpet as he headed into the kudos held at Santa Monica’s Barker Hangar. Downs noted that the vinyl material of his suit and Stalter’s long gown was perfect for the heavy rain that has deluged Southern California for days.\n\n“It’s waterproof,” he observed. “It’s really good in the rain — the water just slipped off the dress,” Stalter added.\n\nDowns gave “Marty Supreme” two thumbs up, saying that he “loved” the film from director Josh Safdie. Stalter admitted she hasn’t seen it yet even though she is friends with Jenner.\n\nStalter and Jenner have a “sushi Fridays” tradition. “We go out for sushi at least once a month,” she said.

This season, those missions have included spending a ton of money, shopping for mansions, planning themed dinners and, in this latest episode, winning a fortune at the casino while teaching old folks from the retirement home how to win at roulette.\n\nIn an interview with Variety at the beginning of the season, Larter said she finds joy in playing Angela and details how show co-creator and writer Taylor Sheridan pens such a unique character — even if not all of the series’ fans embrace her.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I think it’s incredible that Taylor’s writing for a woman in her late ’40s who’s still very alive in her body, who still wants to be intimate with her husband,” Larter said. “Is that why it’s so confusing to some people? I think that Taylor is a provocateur, and we’d like to put a mirror up to certain things, so I think that’s part of it.”\n\nLarter also said that she meets many fans who, beyond enjoying Angela, find her to be an aspirational character.\n\n“I love playing a woman that’s this alive,” she said. “[Angela and Tommy] kind of feel like they’re in high school again. They’re rekindling this love story, and for me to play a woman who just doesn’t care about all the judgment of others is so freeing. I have so many women come up to me who always want to have that … they want to find that little bit of Angela in them, because we’re always asked to live within the societal norms. There’s something so delicious about playing a character who does it by her rules, who just lives her life as she wants to live it, who loves hard and free. I think it’s exciting at this point in my career and at my age to get to play someone who’s this emotionally complex and bold.”\n\nLarter also tracks the frustration of some fans with the early episodes of the first season, when they didn’t know that Tommy’s family would be as integral to the show as his business acumen.\n\n“I’ll explain it to you,” she said. “People only saw the first two episodes, and Taylor loves to throw you a hook. Nobody knew when they saw the first two episodes that our show was really about the family. So you see this beautiful arc in the first season. He knows what he’s doing and has a vision and an idea for seasons of this show. I think that when you only see one or two episodes, it’s really hard to understand the kind of work that we put in for the entire season.”\n\nWatch a supercut of Angela being Angela below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T02:31:31.125438"}

Fun fact: The original name of the main vampire was David Zaslav,” she quipped, as the camera panned to star Michael B. Jordan, who could be seen ruefully shaking his head at the joke.\n\nTouting the period drama’s near-$368 million worldwide box office gross, Handler called out a piece from our sister publication, which readers and celebrities alike slammed for minimizing the critically acclaimed film’s financial performance. “White Hollywood was so shook after seeing the box office numbers, Variety ran the headline: ‘Do box office numbers really matter?'”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nIn another biz-related joke, Handler went after the C-suite in general: “Seth Rogen is here tonight. Years of playing stoners, slackers and underachievers who do next to nothing all day prepared Seth for his latest role of someone who does even less — a studio head.”\n\nThe comic also went after One Battle After Another star DiCaprio, who just last night missed an appearance at the Palm Springs Film Festival (where he was set to accept a Desert Palm Achievement Award), due to travel restrictions.

Spoiler alert: In a recent episode, Billy Bob Thornton went full frontal. Taylor Sheridan said it was nice to have a dick on set that wasn’t Kevin Costner.”\n\nClosing out her opener, after Handler highlighted Jay Kelly‘s Adam Sandler as “the nicest guy in Hollywood,” she launched into a sweet remembrance of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, who were found dead mid-December after being allegedly stabbed by their son Nick Reiner.\n\n“Actually, you’re the second nicest guy in Hollywood, because everyone in this room knows that the nicest guy in Hollywood was Rob Reiner,” she began. “Anyone who ever spent time with Rob Reiner knows that the minute you met him, he felt like an old friend. When you were in a conversation with him, he was present, he was focused and he was funny, and he would ask you tons of questions, whether you were discussing politics or film or the latest beauty trends — he was all in. After I sent him a text thanking him for dinner a few months ago, he texted me back and said, ‘We had so much fun with you last night. Thanks for explaining so much about plastic surgery. It was very edifying.'”\n\nShe concluded, “Rob and Michele were tireless in their efforts to so many important causes, all stemming from one basic idea: decency and that we should all look out for each other. I think we can all agree that we definitely need more of that. So, let’s use tonight as a reminder of that decency and as a reminder of everything Rob and Michele represented and fought so hard for.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:03:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T02:31:32.585301"}

Is Jacob Elordi the New Frontrunner?", "link": "https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/critics-choice-analysis-oscars-jacob-elordi-sinners-1236623589/", "summary": "The 31st Critics Choice Awards winners both reflected where much of the industry sees the Oscar race — and, in key ways, upended it.

In that context, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” sweeping best picture, director and adapted screenplay sends an unmistakable message to the rest of the field: this is the film to beat. Historically, that combination is Oscar catnip — a filmmaker-driven vision paired with broad, cross-branch support.\n\nIn the preferential-ballot era, breadth routinely defeats intensity, and “One Battle After Another” now looks like the title most capable of surviving every round of redistribution.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAnd yet, the sweep also comes with a built-in asterisk. Critics don’t vote for the Oscars. That has long been my No. 1 rule of awards prognosticating, and it still applies. But when a film satisfies critics while simultaneously delivering craft-forward storytelling that appeals to Academy voters across demographics, it becomes exceedingly difficult to dislodge. Expect “One Battle After Another” to gain real momentum as Oscar nominations approach, particularly in the crafts categories — and if it can retain some traction for its acting contenders, including Chase Infiniti and possibly tack on an additional piece of recognition like Regina Hall.\n\nA central question emerging now is whether “One Battle After Another” can complete Paul Thomas Anderson’s trifecta without also winning an acting or craft category. Historically, that path is rare. The last two films to win best picture without at least acting or crafts attached — “The Greatest Show on Earth” (1952) and “Spotlight” (2015). With Variety projecting “One Battle After Another” to approach the upper tier of all-time nomination totals, a scenario in which it converts so lightly on Oscar night would feel counterintuitive for a film that currently reads as inevitable. A more plausible outcome may resemble “The Shape of Water” (2017), which paired picture and director wins with selective below-the-line support.\n\nStill, this race is far from settled. Warner Bros. led all studios overall, thanks in large part to “Sinners,” which co-led all films with four wins: original screenplay for Ryan Coogler, best young actor for Miles Caton, best casting and ensemble, and best score for Ludwig Göransson. That package suggests something a bit more than passion — it hints at a possible coalition. If “Sinners” can carry this momentum through the Golden Globes and convert it into support from SAG, the Writers Guild and other major guilds, it could emerge as the season’s late-breaking spoiler.\n\nAcademy voters have repeatedly shown a willingness to reward bold originality when paired with technical achievement, and “Sinners” is beginning to look like this year’s version of that formula. The original screenplay win is particularly notable. This is a category where the Academy frequently diverges from critics, often favoring dialogue-driven work over structural innovation. Coogler’s win shows the film has broken through in ways that could translate directly onto Oscar ballots, especially within the writers branch, which consistently punches above its weight in the best picture race.\n\nJacob Elordi , winner of the Best Supporting Actor Award for “Frankenstein” Getty Images for Critics Choice\n\nNetflix’s “Frankenstein” also walked away with four prizes, highlighted by a surprising best supporting actor win for Jacob Elordi as the Creature in Guillermo del Toro’s gothic epic. Until now, Elordi had claimed only two critics prizes this season — from the New York Film Critics Online and the Oklahoma Film Critics Circle — raising two immediate questions. Did he just solidify a nomination slot after weeks of being viewed as fringe behind Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, Stellan Skarsgård and Paul Mescal? Or did we witness the Critics Choice version of the Aaron Taylor-Johnson effect, referencing his Golden Globe win for “Nocturnal Animals” that ultimately failed to translate to an Oscar nomination?\n\nThe major difference here is meaningful. “Frankenstein” is far more firmly embedded in the best picture conversation than “Nocturnal Animals” ever was. And crucially, no Critics Choice winner for best supporting actor has ever gone on to miss an Oscar nomination. On that basis alone, Elordi now looks safely in the lineup (at least pending SAG noms next week). Whether he becomes a serious win threat is a separate discussion — one that hinges on follow-through at the Golden Globes and BAFTA. Should that happen, the race will recalibrate quickly.\n\nThe acting races elsewhere remain fluid. Jessie Buckley’s win for portraying Agnes Shakespeare in Chloé Zhao’s grief-soaked drama “Hamnet” came with the most emotionally resonant speech of the night and offers voters a clear, focused way to reward a film that may come up short in best picture, given Buckley was the sole win for the movie. Her two closest competitors — Renate Reinsve and Rose Byrne — will have to play major catch up down the road if they want to catch Buckley.\n\nTimothée Chalamet’s best actor win for “Marty Supreme” further strengthens his frontrunner status heading into the Globes, where the organization’s genre-friendly body could amplify his lead.\n\nBut it is never that simple. At 30, Chalamet would become the second youngest best actor winner in Oscar history — and now, he’s the youngest ever to win Critics Choice. Remember, this is the same Academy that made Leonardo DiCaprio wait until 41 to decide to throw him a bone for climbing into a dead carcass in “The Revenant” (2015). This race has been tightly contested all season, with Chalamet trading critics wins with Michael B. Jordan for “Sinners,” while Ethan Hawke remains a serious factor for “Blue Moon” and DiCaprio stars in the best picture frontrunner. CCA history offers some cautionary tales: Critics Choice winners Chadwick Boseman (“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”), Christian Bale (“Vice”) and Michael Keaton (“Birdman”) are among those who lost their Oscars despite entering as perceived “no brainers.”\n\nAmy Madigan’s supporting actress win for “Weapons” was expected by many pundits, but questions remain about whether the Oscars are willing to reward a genre performance (especially one this cool) — and particularly if she emerges as the film’s sole nominee. If “Weapons” fails to land any additional noms such as casting or original screenplay, history can be unforgiving to those performers. Penélope Cruz’s win for “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” (2008) is the most recent example of a sole nominee winning in the supporting actress category, and that required a rare category switcharoo by Kate Winslet from supporting to lead for “The Reader,” who swept all the precursors. Before that, one has to look back to Marisa Tomei in “My Cousin Vinny” (1992), who was a surprise nominee on the day (and even more shocking winner on Oscar night). These are the exceptions, not the norms.\n\nBy all these somewhat vague measurements, there is still room for another contender (or two) to emerge. And with Oscar voting opening Monday morning, the next week may matter more than any ceremony that comes before.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 06:27:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T06:49:18.787332"}

There can be a clinging hope of changing fortunes as the season rolls along for those who keep losing precursor awards to the same people, but for some eventual Oscar winners the dye can be cast right from the first of many of these ceremonies since other voting groups including the all-important industry awards sometimes follow right in unison. Everyone loves the smell of a winner and getting to go on stage and give inspiational acceptances can really build momentum.\n\nKicking off the actual televised awards-giving portion of the loooooong season that won’t end until March 15 at the Dolby Theatre, this is the first time in my memory the Critics Choice Awards voted on by some 500+ critics and film and tv writers/reporters (FULL DISCLOSURE: I am President of the Film Branch of CCA and vote in both movie and tv ballots), has actually been the lead horse, but this organization has traditionally been a reliable bellwether in crowning eventual Oscar winners no matter where it has landed on the calendar. Last year the Best Picture victory of Anora at the fires-delayed CCA ceremony, followed the next night by both key PGA and DGA victories, sealed the deal for that movie just as final Oscar voting was about to start. CCA also correctly forcast three of the four Oscar acting winners too. Past years have a consistent track record.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nIf tradition holds up we may be able to look back and say this was not just a good night, but a very prescient one, for Timorthee Chalamet (Marty Supreme), Jessie Buckley (Hamnet), Amy Madigan (Weapons) , and Jacob Elordi (Frankenstein). This quartet managed the neat trick of scoring key acting triumphs in four different movies, none of which were the Best Picture winner. That honor went to Paul Thomas Anderson’s juggernaut, One Battle After Another which has a perfect track record on the critics circuit so far this year by always coming up at the end and being named Best Picture. Every single time. That has now happened at the Gothams, LA, NY, London, Chicago, Toronto, San Francisco Film Critics, countless other regional groups, National Board Of Review, and now this weekend at both the National Society of Film Critics and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThis kind of run is quite rare these days and can have a strong effect on Oscar voters, no question about it. And it is not as if the industry has to be convinced about Anderson’s film. It has been rapturously received wherever it has screened around town starting with its turnaway official Academy screening in September. Plus Anderson is considered way overdue with 11 previous Oscar nominations including three for Best Picture. We had to wait until the end of the three hour CCA show for its three victories including Adapted Screenplay and Director, but it is now clear OBAA is the one to beat, putting it in prime position as all the guild nominations begin unspooling including SAG on Wednesday, and then DGA, PGA, WGA, BAFTA, Oscars etc in the next three weeks.\n\n(L-R) Owen Cooper and Jacob Elordi (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nWhat was refreshing though about the CCA show was the way it spread the love around . OBAA had 14 nominations but only those three (albeit key) wins. Sinners had 17 nominations and led with 11-time nominated Frankenstein with four each. The lead acting wins for Chalamet and Buckley (whose acceptance was especially good and makes me look forward to the next twelve times she has to give one) weren’t surprising, and veteran Madigan’s popular Supporting Actress win was something you could feel might happen. She was a charmer. Many might have been surpised at Elordi’s Supporting Actor triumph as the Creature in Frankenstein but voters clearly recognized the degree of difficulty and this is a major boost for his Oscar nomination chances eight days before that balloting begins in the uber competitive Supporting Actor category. I sat at the front Netflix table with the Frankenstein group and Elordi who was enthusiastically standing (at 6’6 he can’t be missed in the room) and cheering on everyone including his young Wuthering Heights co-star Owen Cooper who followed his Emmy win with another here for Adolescence. When the artisans behind the hair and makeup , as well as production design of Frankenstein were all also announced as winners, they came over from Table 58 and the group hugs were palpable. I also noticed during commercial breaks the inevitable seat fillers would come and sit at the empty chairs at the table with Elordi affably engaging in conversation with all of them. Nice guy .\n\nWith Sound and Editing wins for F1, that Apple Original Films production looks to follow in the Oscar trajectory of one of its inspirations, 1966’s Grand Prix, another racing classic that earned three Oscars for its Sound and Editing. And with Song and Animated Feature for KPOP: Demon Hunters, plus Cinematorgraphy for the gorgeous Train Dreams you could easily see those two Netflix films doing the same thing at the Oscars. CCA just annointed them front runner status in those categories in a night that was very big for the streamer when you also consider the four wins for Frankenstein, as well as a sweep in the Limited Series TV categories for Adolescence. And hey, throw in those big Warner Bros wins for OBAA and Sinners, and well….

Besides “Buen Camino,” the other two movies are concept comedy “Madly” by director Paolo Genovese (“Perfect Strangers”), which pulled $21 million via 01 Distribution — landing at No. 3 on the 2025 chart — and Ferzan Ozpetek’s female-centric ensemble drama “Diamonds,” which weighed in at No. 8 with a $19 million take via Vision Distribution.\n\nDuring 2025, homegrown titles in Italy enjoyed the best box office level of the past decade, Cinetel underlined in a statement. Italian movies, including co-productions, generated more than €160 million ($187 million) in grosses last year, scoring more than 22.5 million admissions and a roughly 33% admissions share, up from 25.7% in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Hollywood still accounted for more than 50% of the Italian market share, with Disney continuing to be the country’s dominant distributor thanks mainly to animated titles “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2” as well as James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”\n\nCinetel, in its preliminary 2025 analysis, noted that the country saw relatively robust moviegoing figures in the summer — which is historically a sore spot as millions of Italians hit the beach — and that moviegoing gained plenty of momentum toward the end of the year. December 2025, which saw the releases of both “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and Zalone’s “Buen Camino,” marked Italy’s strongest box office month since 1995, which is the year that Cinetel began collecting data, “confirming the central role that holidays play in supporting overall results,” the statement said.\n\nThough Italian moviegoing remains well below pre-pandemic levels — when admissions hovered around 100 million — the country’s current box office stability is encouraging compared to the moviegoing crisis looming in some other European countries, especially Spain, which in 2025 saw an 8% decline to 65 million admissions. January Italian releases expected to keep the momentum going include Paolo Sorrentino’s Venice 2025 opener “La Grazia” and Josh Safdie’s Timothée Chalamet-starrer “Marty Supreme.”\n\nTop 10 movies at the Italian box office (in dollars) in 2025:\n\n\n\n“Buen Camino”: $42 million – Medusa\n\n“Lilo & Stitch”: $25.6 million – Disney\n\n“Madly”: $21 million – 01 Distribution\n\n“Zootopia 2″: $18.6 million – Disney\n\n“Avatar: Fire and Ash”: $20.6 million – Disney\n\n“A Minecraft Movie”: $13.5 million – Warner Bros.\n\n“Jurassic World: Rebirth”: $12.8 million – Universal Pictures International\n\n“Diamonds”: $11.6 million – Vision Distribution\n\n“The Conjuring: Last Rights”: $10.9 million – Warner Bros.\n\n“How to Train Your Dragon”: $10.6 million – Universal Pictures International\n\nSource: Cinetel, BoxOffice Mojo", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:45:58 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T12:59:26.704041"}

Advertisers typically use the upfront to pick up ad time at rates they hope will be cheaper than buying later on in the year, when they might cost more. NBCUniversal has also held a presentation for years on Mondays, and has long used the evening of that day for a private gathering with sports sponsors, as well as a Telemundo event. Last year, after Amazon usurped Monday evening, NBC moved its Telemundo gathering to a different day of the week.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAmazon says it will use its upfront event to tout its talent lineup across venues including Prime Video, Prime Sports, Amazon MGM Studios, Twitch, Wondery, and Amazon Music.

The trailer then shows stills of the young cast from the show’s earliest days. David Bowie’s “Heroes,” which “Stranger Things” used more than once, including over the end credit in the series finale, plays as the trailer continues.

(Do read Variety‘s oral history of the last days of “Stranger Things.”)\n\nIn a statement accompanying the announcement, the Duffer brothers said: “Growing up in Durham, North Carolina, we dreamed of becoming filmmakers — but Hollywood felt impossibly far away. Everything changed when we watched the behind-the-scenes documentaries for ‘The Lord of the Rings’ — on-the-ground films that showed the real nuts and bolts of how a massive production actually gets made.

In November, a federal judge ruled in Dish’s favor, denying Disney’s request to block the short-term streaming plans.

Along with the UI redesign, the company is prepping the release of a new Fire TV mobile app that adds content discovery and management tools, and it’s introducing our first-ever lifestyle TV, the Amazon Ember Artline.\n\nAccording to Joshua Danovitz, Amazon’s VP of Fire TV, the new UI is overall more “modern” — cleaner, faster and better organized. The interface displays movies, TV shows, sports, news and live content across all your subscriptions, so that when you browse the UI you will see titles and programming from all the apps you use.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe new Fire TV UI features rounded corners, redesigned color gradients, updated typography and more optimized spacing. Beyond the aesthetics, the underlying code was rebuilt to make the experience faster: Danovitz said in some cases the new UI is up to 30% faster.\n\nThe redesign also increases the number of apps users can pin to the Fire TV home screen, from six to 20. The Menu button on the Fire TV remote lets you access Games, Art & Photos, and the Ambient Experience with a few clicks. There’s also a shortcut panel on the right rail you can access by long-pressing the Home button on the remote, to let you add shortcuts the controls including audio and display settings and smart-home device management.\n\nFire TV will continue to include Alexa+, Amazon’s generative AI-powered agent, to let you ask to watch something based on the mood you’re in, who you’re with, or actors or directors you like. Alexa on Fire TV also recently added to ability for you to ask to jump straight to a specific movie scene.\n\nThe new Fire TV UI will launch starting in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd generation), and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S. Later this spring, Amazon plans to expand the new UI design to more countries and more devices, including the latest-generation Fire TV 4K streaming media players and TVs including the Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series as well as TVs from partners like Hisense, Insignia, Panasonic and TCL.\n\nUpdated Fire TV mobile app\n\nAlso launching in February is a redesigned Fire TV mobile app — which until now has essentially functioned as a backup remote control.\n\nThe redesigned Fire TV mobile app (which will be available as a free download) adds the ability to browse content, manage your watchlist, and play titles on your TV, with a look and feel that matches the new Fire TV design, according to Danovitz. Now Fire TV customers can use their phone as a second screen to discover what to watch next or add a friend’s show recommendation to your watchlist when you’re away from home.\n\nAlso at CES, Amazon will show off its first lifestyle TV, under the new brand name Amazon Ember. The Amazon Ember Artline is a 4K QLED TV designed to be hung on the wall like a piece of artwork.\n\nThe Amazon Ember Artline is the company’s thinnest TV to date, measuring just 1.5 inches deep, and will be available 10 different frame colors (walnut, ash, teak, black oak, matte white, midnight blue, fig, pale gold, graphite and silver). The TVs have a matte screen (to reduce glare) and will be available in 55- or 65-inch screen sizes, priced starting at $899. It’s scheduled to go on sale this spring in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the U.K.\n\nAs with its previous-generation TVs, the Amazon Ember Artline comes with far-field microphones to support Alexa+ and includes its Omnisense technology that automatically turns the ambient experience on and off when people enter or leave the room. The Ember Artline is integrated with Amazon Photos and offers more than 2,000 pieces of free art. It also has an AI-powered feature that lets you take up to four photos of the room where you plan to hang the TV and get personalized recommendations on the best artworks to show on-screen to match the décor.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T15:35:33.552092"}

In the case of the Oscar-nominated, multi-hyphenate filmmaker Sam Davis, motivation came from an old Russian short story and the social media juggernauts Instagram and TikTok. Davis’s short film, The Singers, based on the Ivan Turgenev story of the same name, follows a varied group of down-on-their-luck men who find themselves making a connection with one another through an impromptu singing competition.\n\nThe 17-minute short has garnered wins for Best Director and Best International Film at HollyShorts London, the Grand Prize for Best Narrative Short and Audience Choice Award for Narrative at the Indy Shorts International Film Festival and Best Cinematography in the Professional Competition at SCAD Film Festival.\n\nHere, Davis talks to Deadline about the vulnerability of men and the fun, creative challenge of turning talented buskers into lowkey film stars.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDEADLINE: What compelled you to adapt Ivan Turgenev’s story? And what themes were you trying to convey to the audience?\n\nSAM DAVIS: There were a few things that sparked for me when I read the short story. Initially, I wasn’t thinking about adapting it, and I even fell asleep a couple of times while reading it because it’s dense and tough to get through [laughs]. But by the time I did, I was so taken by this unexpected testament to the power of connection through singing. You could extend the book’s ideation to art of any kind or the concept of vulnerability. The characters in the story are these crusty, hard-shell underdogs who reminded me a lot of the people I grew up around, in particular. I’m from a small town in Michigan, and there were a lot of these people who were really soulful and complete with talents and passions, but you wouldn’t know it at first glance.\n\nThen, I saw this project as a unique opportunity for me as a filmmaker to apply my background in documentary work in a fiction piece that could be a hat tip to Robert Altman and some of my other favorite filmmakers like Chloé Zhao, Sean Baker and the Safdie brothers, who are modern examples of people synthesizing narrative and documentary in their own way.\n\nDEADLINE: You found your singers on Instagram and TikTok? Walk us through that.\n\nDAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed the short story the first time I read it, but I didn’t close the book and think, “This is for me. The next three years, I’m dedicated to making this, a film adaptation of this story.” That moment didn’t come until a few minutes later when I opened my phone and looked at Instagram. The first video was a viral clip of this incredible New York City busker, Mike Yung. It was an unbelievable performance [of “Unchained Melody”] that I was watching and so moved by. I saw people passing by without paying much attention to him, and I also read a story about all these modern-day viral-video singing sensations who, for whatever reason, had never really broken through. So, that’s where the idea came from. This was the idea of basically filling a bar with these unexpected geniuses, letting them shine, and giving them a stage they’ve never had but always deserved.\n\nDEADLINE: How did you end up pitching these guys?\n\nDAVIS: When I reached out, most of them thought they were being scammed. I would reach out and tell them, “Hey, I’m an Oscar-nominated filmmaker in LA trying to do this new project.” And they were like, “Go to Hell.” It’s a long story, but basically, my documentary background came into play. Docs are about, at least in the development and pre-production stages, building relationships with people before a camera is even turned on and gaining a sense of mutual trust. I have to trust that they’ll be able to deliver on some level and be vulnerable on camera. They have to trust that they’re not being scammed and that they’ll be represented with respect. So, getting everyone together was this long, arduous, and clumsy process of scrolling whenever I had an opportunity, leaving comments, sending DMs, and eventually it all just came together into this eclectic group of guys from all over the world who had never been on camera before. And who were all willing to take a leap after getting to know each other a bit via Zoom and phone calls.\n\nDEADLINE: When did you know which songs you were going to feature in the short film?\n\nDAVIS: Not until the day before we filmed. The whole process was radical: we just went all in on spontaneity and having real people in one room and took a documentary approach to a narrative film. Because of that, I didn’t feel I could commit to a specific song until I heard it from the singer’s voice in the space where we were going to film. Unfortunately, with the tiny, short-film budget, we couldn’t get them in that space until the day before the shoot. It was impractical because these guys were all coming from all over the place to LA to film. There’s an exception with Mike Yung, the bartender, who was the first [cast], he sang “Unchained Melody” in that viral video and in the short film. That was always going to be his performance. But for the rest of them, it was just a conversation. We sat together in the bar the day before the shoot and talked until we eventually landed on these songs you hear in the film.\n\nDEADLINE: What was the most challenging thing to adapt?\n\nDAVIS: I’ll talk about the bar first. I like that the bar in the story is this one building, and the opening shot is this dark void next to the railroad tracks. In a way, the bar is a visual metaphor for each of the guys in the bar. These are all these unsuspecting little containers for so much story. And in that bar, little do you know in the opening, but there’s a huge world of lived experience, possibilities, song, and connection that will come out of that little room, and that’s what each of the characters is about. When we were casting, we didn’t just want people who could sing. We wanted people who would bring real-life experience that would enhance their characters, like an ingredient that could explode outward and affect the story in different ways. For example, two war veterans could talk to each other, which was an idea that we didn’t have until we found ourselves there. These two guys were genuinely sharing their experiences: one in Vietnam and the other in Afghanistan.\n\nThe idea of the bar we ended up filming in was inspired by a [place I grew up near] in Michigan, where I always imagined shooting [a film]. However, it became impractical to get everyone to this small town in Michigan, so we ultimately decided to do it in LA and just fake the exteriors. We spent a lot of time hunting for the right bar, because we didn’t want anything too precious and cute. Just like the guys in the film, I didn’t want to cast people who were going to get right back to me or those with websites and managers; I wanted to hunt and chase. I wanted the type of person who maybe didn’t want to be found. My ideology was the same as finding this bar. I knew this bar wasn’t going to show up on Eater’s list of coolest dive bars in LA [laughs]. We eventually found it after exhausting hundreds of bars in LA and the surrounding areas – Moose Lodge. It’s a non-commercial, private, members-only bar in La Habra, and it just had the right vibe.\n\nSecondly, pulling this cast together and getting all of these guys under one roof felt like a mini miracle by the time we were there at the Moose Lodge. I’ll never forget walking in and seeing all these faces. We spent a year and a half handpicking from all over the internet to find them. It was this really jovial and strange bringing together of different people, and like in the film, there was this evolution from a group of 20 to 30 strangers, plus our crew, into a little family by the end.\n\nDEADLINE: What’s your musical style?\n\nDAVIS: Keeping in line with The Singers, I think the film has the spirit of John Prine and Leonard Cohen. There’s a Leonard Cohen song [“Closing Time”] in the end credits, which I am so thrilled that we were able to get.\n\nDEADLINE: You’ve made the rounds at SXSW, Hollyshorts, AFI and SCAD, to name a few. Now you’ve landed the Oscar shortlist. What do you think people are responding to?\n\nDAVIS: The film is a sneaky crowd-pleaser. It starts rather calmly, but by the end of it, maybe you’ve cried a bit, or have been touched by it or laughed. It’s a full meal of emotion. I hope people are enjoying it in that sense. Also, I don’t think it’s a political film. A lot of Oscar films, docs and narratives tend to be political. This film is more soulful than political. Of course, though, we can unpack it and talk about vulnerability and masculinity. All those things are real, and those themes are in there. There’s a David Lynch quote that I love, where he says, “The film is the talking,” which is this thing of, after watching something, we talk about this and that and beat things to death. But I think those themes are important. Growing up in a small town in Michigan, where we weren’t really taught how to process, men especially, our emotions in a healthy way – that’s something I still work through to this day. And for me, the art of filmmaking is a great outlet. In a lot of ways, that’s what’s happening in the story, the beautiful act of being vulnerable and connecting with a stranger next to you, who, 10 minutes ago, you thought had nothing in common with you. I think that message has a universal application.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:10:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T15:35:34.094210"}

It’s a squadron of high- profile spinoffs and sequels to everything from “The Avengers” (with Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans back in spandex) to “Star Wars,” with a smattering of Mario and Luigi and Buzz and Woody in between.\n\n\n\nBut since COVID upended the movie business, the box office has never been harder to predict. Last year, Marvel, once the most consistent hit – maker in Hollywood, saw one hyped-up superhero movie after another fail to connect with audiences, while auteur-driven films like “Sinners” and anime offerings like “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” became some of 2025’s most unlikely successes.\n\n\n\nSo , with that caveat out of the way, we’re staring into our crystal ball and going out on a limb to predict the movies that will struggle or soar over the next 12 months.\n\nSure Things\n\nMatt Damon in “ The Odyssey Universal Pictures\n\nThe Super Mario Galaxy Movie (Universal)\n\nRelease date: April 3\n\nThrill factor: Generations of gamers have traveled to the Mushroom Kingdom, a familiarity that helped turn “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” into a billion-dollar smash. The follow-up should get a similar reception, particularly as it has the spring box office more or less to itself.\n\nChill factor: Video game adaptations like “A Minecraft Movie” and “Sonic the Hedgehog” have been one of the only genres that have reliably worked. Could we be nearing oversaturation?\n\nVerdict: Who are we kidding? The Nintendo brand is king, and those mustachioed siblings are its most beloved ambassadors.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nToy Story 5 (Disney)\n\nRelease date: June 19\n\nThrill factor: “Toy Story” represents Pixar at its best, and this installment — which confronts the reality that children would rather play with screens than dolls — feels like a timely reason to revisit the animated world of talking toys.\n\nChill factor: Maybe the tech-forward premise will hit too close to home for parents who prefer to park their kids in front of iPads at restaurants?\n\nVerdict: Woody and Buzz might be afraid of smart tablets, but they needn’t worry about box office grosses. “Toy Story 5” will be the biggest family film of the year.\n\nThe Odyssey (Universal)\n\nRelease date: July 17\n\nThrill factor: Christopher Nolan turned the life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer into a silver-screen sensation. The Trojan War sounds a lot more commercial, and it helps that the actors filling out the tunics include A-listers like Matt Damon, Tom Holland and Zendaya.\n\nChill factor: Homer? During the summer? Sounds like homework.\n\nVerdict: July belongs to Nolan, who has debuted blockbusters such as “The Dark Knight” and “Dunkirk” at the height of popcorn season. “The Odyssey” will join the club.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day (Sony)\n\nRelease date: July 31\n\nThrill factor: Tom Holland is dusting off his Spidey suit for the first time since 2021’s “No Way Home” became a bonanza with $1.9 billion. That film ended on a massive cliff-hanger, meaning a lot of people have been waiting to see what happens after Peter Parker makes the difficult decision to erase his identity from the world.\n\nChill factor: “No Way Home” became a cinematic event in part because multiversal shenanigans allowed two prior Spider-Men, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, to save the day with Holland. Will hype be as high with just one Spidey on-screen?\n\nVerdict: Marvel might be waning in box office popularity, but Spider-Man remains on the comic book A-list.\n\nSafe Bets\n\nBaby Yoda in “The Mandalorian and Grogu” LUCASFILM\n\nThe Mandalorian and Grogu (Disney)\n\nThe Mandalorian and Grogu — Disney\n\nRelease date: May 22\n\nThrill factor: The last “Star Wars” movie, 2019’s billion-dollar blockbuster “The Rise of Skywalker,” was released seven long years ago. In the time since, Baby Yoda (né the Child né Grogu) has become a household name through the very popular Disney+ series “The Mandalorian.”\n\nChill factor: Lucasfilm has struggled for what feels like eons to get a theatrical release off the ground. Meanwhile, Disney+ has become the go-to destination for all things set in a galaxy far, far away with shows ranging from “The Book of Boba Fett” and “Ahsoka” to “Andor.” Do audiences still associate “Star Wars” with the cinematic experience, or is it a franchise they now prefer to watch at home?\n\nVerdict: “The Mandalorian and Grogu” will benefit from goodwill and brand recognition. However, not every “Star Wars” spinoff will feel the box office Force.\n\nAvengers: Doomsday (Disney)\n\nRelease date: Dec. 18\n\nThrill factor: Downey and Evans return to the MCU, bringing the two mightiest heroes back into the fold. They’re joined by fan-favorite characters from “The X-Men” and “The Fantastic Four” in a true “the gang’s all here” extravaganza.\n\nChill factor: Superhero fatigue is real, and Marvel can’t seem to shake it. The studio’s last few films — “Thunderbolts,” “Captain America: Brave New World” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” — all disappointed at the box office.\n\nVerdict: Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It’s been six years since the last “Avengers” adventures, and Evans and Downey’s presence will make this sequel a bona fide event.\n\nVerity (Amazon MGM)\n\nRelease date: Oct. 2\n\nThrill factor: Colleen Hoover might be the new box office whisperer after “It Ends With Us” became a sleeper success for Sony, and “Regretting You” was one of Paramount’s only 2025 releases to turn a theatrical profit. “Verity,” which follows a struggling writer hired to complete a popular book series after the potentially unhinged author becomes injured, promises deliciously campy performances from stars Dakota Johnson and Anne Hathaway.\n\nChill factor: Adult-oriented fare is, alas, always a risk in post-pandemic times.\n\nVerdict: Twisty thrillers are fun to watch with crowds, so “Verity” will become a breakout with women in the vein of “The Housemaid” or “A Simple Favor.”\n\nQuestion Marks\n\nRyan Gosling in “Project Hail Mary” Screenshot courtesy YouTube/Amazon MGM\n\nProject Hail Mary (Amazon MGM)\n\nRelease date: March 20\n\nThrill factor: Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are returning to the director’s chair for the first time since 2014’s “22 Jump Street.” With “Project Hail Mary,” the very funny filmmakers team up with the endlessly charming Ryan Gosling on a sci-fi adventure about an amnesiac astronaut tasked with saving the world from Armageddon.\n\nChill factor: Amazon MGM doesn’t have a track record of launching original properties, and with a hefty $150 million budget, “Project Hail Mary” needs to pack ’em in to justify its price tag.\n\nVerdict: Gosling, a versatile actor who should have won an Oscar for his performance of “I’m Just Ken” at the Academy Awards ceremony, isn’t a bankable star. After all, his 2024 action comedy “The Fall Guy” misfired theatrically despite great reviews. That means quality won’t be enough to get people to multiplexes. It’s up to the studio’s marketing department to turn the film into a must-see cinematic event.\n\nDisclosure Day (Universal)\n\nRelease date: June 12\n\nThrill factor: For decades, Steven Spielberg has been synonymous with blockbuster entertainment. Now, the man who made “Indiana Jones” and “E.T.” returns to spectacle-style filmmaking with an alien-invasion adventure.\n\nChill factor: Does the old master still have it? Spielberg’s spent most of the past 20 years directing Oscar bait like “Bridge of Spies” and “Lincoln.” Has he outgrown his populist roots?\n\nVerdict: The title sounds like a bad airplane novel, but the trailer delivers plenty of thrills. It’s just hard to convince people to turn out for something that isn’t based on a game or a known property.\n\nClayface (Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease date: Sept. 11\n\nThrill factor: With comic book adaptations, audiences are fine with familiar faces but clearly aren’t settling for more of the same story. In that respect, “Clayface,” a body-horror film about a struggling actor with a disfigured face who takes drastic measures to transform his body into clay, feels vastly different from “Brave New World,” “Thunderbolts” and the family-friendly “Superman.”\n\nChill factor: Has anyone, on this planet or any other, ever heard of Clayface?\n\nVerdict: James Gunn and Peter Safran may have revived the DCU with “Superman,” but not every comic book character is worthy of the big-screen treatment.\n\nPractical Magic 2 (Warner Bros)\n\nRelease date: Sept. 18\n\nThrill factor: Nearly 30 years after the first “Practical Magic” became a cult hit on home entertainment — remember VHS? — Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman reunite for another supernatural rom-com.\n\nChill factor: It’s worth noting that “Practical Magic” flopped when it was released in 1998. Given Bullock and Kidman’s price tags, Warners is probably banking on them casting a stronger spell on moviegoers in 2025.\n\nVerdict: Nostalgia is powerful — just look at other long-gestating sequels like “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.” But this follow-up feels random. Besides Bullock and Kidman’s agents, who’s asking for this?\n\nBiggest Risks\n\nJessie Buckley as Frankenstein’s monster’s betrothed in “The Bride” ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThe Bride! (Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease date: March 6\n\nThrill factor: Audiences have been flipping for auteur-driven horror films such as Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” and Robert Eggers’ “Nosferatu.” Maggie Gyllenhaal, who impressed with her directorial debut, “The Lost Daughter,” is offering up a bold vision with her steampunk take on “Frankenstein.”\n\nChill factor: Guillermo del Toro just did his own thing with Mary Shelley with last fall’s “Frankenstein.” Some stories don’t need to be revived again and again.\n\nVerdict: The buzz on the $80 million production has been frightful. Unless critics swoon, audiences aren’t showing up to see this undead couple in action.\n\nHoppers (Disney)\n\nRelease date: March 6\n\nThrill factor: Family films have, for the most part, been all the rage. And the most recent animated adventure was December’s “SpongeBob” sequel, so “Hoppers” should benefit from pent-up demand.\n\nChill factor: Pixar hasn’t successfully launched a new animated film since 2017’s musical hit “Coco.” Even last year’s positively reviewed “Elio” cratered at the box office. Plus, the plot — revolving around scientists who can transfer human consciousness to robotic animals — sounds kind of confusing.\n\nVerdict: “Hoppers” needs to be undeniably great and marketable to parents of youngsters. Otherwise, Pixar is doomed to retreat into the world of sequels and possibly forced to send anything new to streaming.\n\nDigger (Warner Bros.)\n\nRelease date: Oct. 2\n\nThrill factor: It’s been a while since Tom Cruise, who once worked with Spielberg and Scorsese, put himself in the hands of a true master. He’s got one of the greatest who ever slid behind a camera in Alejandro G. Iñárritu.\n\nChill factor: These two are partnering on the story of a powerful man who tries to save humanity from a disaster he’s unleashed. We just lived through Elon Musk and DOGE. Oh, and it’s a comedy.\n\nVerdict: Execution dependent. Cruise’s movies are pricey, so unless he gave WB a big bargain, he and Iñárritu better deliver the next “Tropic Thunder.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T16:38:58.980728"}

Marisa Abela and Myha’la — who star in HBO’s steamy, propulsive finance drama “Industry” — are filming a key scene for the show’s upcoming season in which their characters, Yasmin Kara-Hanani and Harper Stern, are having an uncharacteristic heart-to-heart. While barely touching the Negronis in front of them (it’s actually watery tea, so it’s understandable), the frenemies are almost competing to reveal their own deep, painful vulnerabilities. At one point, after telling Harper how “fucking jealous” she is of her — and for the first time in five or six takes of this scene — Yasmin starts to cry. The tears are not in the script, but for creators, writers, showrunners and, now, directors Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, sitting behind monitors about 10 feet away, it’s just the emotional ad-lib they were looking for. Kay vigorously fist-pumps the air while Down, sporting a blue “Industry Writers Room” cap, jabs enthusiastically at the screen. “That’s it — that’s the shot,” he eagerly whispers to Down, his close friend since they met at Oxford University almost 20 years ago. “Cut! Beautiful!” For all the sex, drugs, widespread debauchery and unintelligible financial jargon that has defined “Industry” since it launched in late 2020, it’s the twisty-turny, sometimes-supportive, sometimes-backstabbing dynamic between damaged British heiress Yasmin and ruthless American overachiever Harper that has become the show’s central axis. The two — who Abela likens to “siblings in how they get away with saying so much to one another” — are the sole survivors from the five fresh-faced would-be traders who arrived at fictitious bank Pierpoint & Co. in Season 1. Their diverging journeys since have effectively reflected the growing ambition and confidence of “Industry” itself. In the explosive Season 3 finale, which aired in September 2024, Yasmin opted for supposed stability, choosing a privileged life of grouse hunts and tweed jodhpurs on the vast country estate of aristocratic posho and failed entrepreneur Henry Muck (Kit Harington). Harper, meanwhile, agreed to become the Gen Z successor to a shadowy old money head of a bearish investment fund. Their arcs would appear to have been completed, as had Pierpoint’s. Its trading floor — the setting for most of the hostile financial bedlam — was last seen smothered in tarpaulin while awaiting closure after the bank was acquired by an Egyptian sovereign wealth fund. It looked like the perfect series closure for “Industry.”\n\n“I could think of five different reasons why Yasmin and Harper should never speak to each other again — I would never talk to this bitch if it was me in real life!,” says Myha’la. Courtesy of HBO\n\n“Writing yourself out of a corner is a great creative challenge,” Down says with a smile, speaking earlier in the day over coffee at a Cardiff restaurant. Adds Kay: “But there’s no corner you can’t write yourself out of, especially in our world, because it’s mine and his brainchild.”\n\nFor Myha’la, even though the last episode of Season 3 was “written as though it was the end,” she always thought they’d be coming back. “I’m sure the second they finished that finale, they were like, ‘What else can I write?,” she says. “Just for the sheer joy of competing with themselves, and because they love to make art — they love the challenge.”\n\nAs brazenly highlighted by Season 4 (which premieres on Jan. 11 in HBO’s vaunted Sunday, 9 p.m., time slot), Down and Kay’s solution to cornering themselves so exquisitely has been to blow everything up and throw the pieces back together again. But this time without the constraints of Pierpoint’s walls.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“In a way, that creative freedom has been amazing,” Kay says. “We were writing about one world, and at the edges of that world were other worlds, like media and politics. With Season 4, we were like, now we don’t have a trading floor, we can actually just go into those spaces.”\n\nFrom those spaces have emerged new characters (Max Minghella, Kiernan Shipka and Charlie Heaton are among the additions), all very “Industry” in being deeply troubled, unlikable and compelling. There’s a new company at the show’s center in Tender, a fintech startup looking to buy and bully its way into monopolistic dominance. Opportunistic politicians and investigative reporters swing by, as do fascist dynasties and some sinister Jeffrey Epstein undertones. Even the sex and drugs have been turned up a notch, this time with a bleaker, more manipulative edge (but not always: Henry snorting a line off a harpsichord in his manor as a group of kids on a school trip walks by is one of many comedic moments).\n\nSeason 4 also throws wholly new genres into the mix, with one particularly dark episode Kay describes as a “neo-Gothic period drama in a big house.”\n\nIn a show all about risk-taking and its (mostly destructive) consequences, both admit that making such a detour from its origins is itself a high-stakes gamble.\n\n“But I honestly think there’s no point in doing anything if you’re not going to take a risk,” says Down. “I’m sure some people will be like, ‘What the fuck are they doing? It’s supposed to be set in a bank!’ But this show is whatever the fuck we want it to be.”\n\n“Industry” was always destined to be the “little engine that could,” says Jane Tranter, an executive producer and co-founder of Bad Wolf, the production company and physical studio in South Wales where the show has mostly shot (as have, among other things, “His Dark Materials” and “Doctor Who”). A former senior BBC exec, Tranter was already thinking about a drama set in the world of finance when, in late 2015, just after she returned to the U.K. from a stint in L.A., HBO’s Casey Bloys, now the company’s CEO, approached her about doing a series.\n\n“I was absolutely fascinated as to why, after the crash of 2008, when the banks and everything they’d been doing were exposed, young people — who were meant to be the generation thinking differently about the world — were still going in their droves to work in the city,” she says. Struck by the real-life tragedy of an intern who died of exhaustion (a story that wound up being in the very first episode), Tranter realized the way in would be these entry-level recruits. As it happened, a colleague had just met budding scribes Down and Kay about a different project, and they’d mentioned they’d both previously worked in banks. Tranter persuaded them to start writing. But there was one minor hitch: They’d never written for a network.\n\n“HBO originally promoted this as ‘Two ex-bankers have written a show about finance and it’s going to blow the lid off the industry,’ not knowing that we’d spent our time sat behind desks with no power for a year,” says Konrad Kay (left).\n\nThe first script they based on their own miserable experiences on banking’s lowest rungs. It was, as Kay freely says now, “really dour” and “glacially slow,” prompting Bloys to ask whether they’d actually “had any fun when you were in this job?” They started again, this time trying to bottle some of the “anticipatory energy” they had going into the workplace for the first time. There was still a lengthy process of endless rewrites — that first episode would go through roughly 60 iterations — and what Down describes as “three years of development hell.” As it happens, “Industry” getting the eventual green light was one of the final acts of HBO boss Richard Plepler before he exited in February 2019.\n\nWith the BBC on board as a co-producer, the first season started shooting that summer, boasting a lead cast of first-timers practically as new to TV as the show’s creators.\n\nAlongside Abela and the now mononymic Myha’la were Harry Lawtey, David Jonsson and Nabhaan Rizwan (all now names very much in the ascendancy — and in the case of Jonsson, a BAFTA rising star winner). The only recognizable actor was “Lost” alumni Ken Leung, playing the fiery baseball bat-swinging Pierpoint vet Eric Tao. Lena Dunham directed the pilot episode and warned Leung that he’d probably have to play mentor. “She was like, they’re just out of drama school — they might be looking at you in a certain way, so be prepared,” Leung says. They didn’t need any help. “They are incredible actors, as you can see from the get-go.”\n\nBut Season 1 was not a hit. Despite solid reviews praising its fast pace style and the performances and numerous column inches dedicated to the raucous levels of nihilistic behavior on display (“Millennium Mad Men,” claimed one headline), ratings were fractional. While the show developed a passionate, if tiny, audience, “we had to really push to get a second season and had to really push again to get a third,” says Tranter. (She also notes that, at around $2 million an episode, “Industry” was cheap to make, at least by HBO standards.)\n\nIt was Season 3, the one that wrapped the story up in a bow (almost), that would become “Industry”’s breakout. Sensing it might be their last, Down and Kay went for it. “We said to each other, let’s just swing as hard as we can for the fences and if it blows up, who cares?” recalls Kay. But audiences and critics alike loved the swing (which included, amid a kaleidoscope of depraved mayhem, disastrous IPOs, a brawl in a kids’ soft play area, abusive billionaire parents and two sudden deaths — one shockingly violent).\n\nOne of the show’s side characters, the foulmouthed and near-comically amoral Pierpoint VP Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia), was even given his own episode, a high-intensity coke-addled descent into chaos as he tries to recoup spiraling gambling debts. The Safdie brothers — and Down and Kay’s love for “Uncut Gems” — can take credit for inspiring that one.\n\nThankfully, with HBO having promoted “Industry” from a Monday slot to Sunday, more people watched Season 3 than ever. The premiere debuted with a live audience of 300,000 and would surpass 1.6 million with delayed viewing. Season 4 was by far the quickest green light in the show’s history. HBO’s VP of drama programming, Cela Sutton, says the network realized it now “had a hit on our hands” and knew the drill. “We were excited to renew it as quickly as possible.”\n\n“I love the way they get away with those names,” says Kit Harington, who joined “Industry” in Season 3 as spoiled aristocrat and entrepreneur Henry Muck alongside fellow show newcomer Miriam Petche, playing Pierpoint intern Sweetpea Golightly. Both have much bigger roles in Season 4.\n\nWhile the scope of “Industry” has grown with each renewal, the confidence of the team putting it together has evolved with it. Down and Kay, showrunners since the start, marked their directorial debuts with the final two episodes of Season 3, but have helmed four of eight episodes in Season 4 (including the one they admit is the “most out there”).\n\nWhen cinematographer Federico Cesca joined “Industry” in Season 2, he was almost entirely shooting on shoulders, the camera effectively behaving as it was were a character in itself. “It was unpredictable and with plenty of agency to look away from people and find something else,” he says. But alongside Down and Kay, the Europe-based Argentine has broadened the show’s cinematic language, often with inspiration from their favorite directors and films. In Season 3, there’s a flashback sequence during an ayahuasca trip that Cesca describes as “almost Kubrickian,” and another (perhaps actually Kubrickian) scene he bills as “‘Barry Lyndon’ meets ‘A Clockwork Orange.’” In Season 4, he says there are notes of “Magnolia” and “The Brutalist,” plus — in keeping with the financial-thriller themes — “Michael Clayton” and “Margin Call.”\n\nCasting, too, has graduated. Landing “Game of Thrones” star Harington for Season 3 was a serious statement of intent — the show’s first major signing. But it was helped by the fact that he was already a fan. “Mickey and Konrad are quite disparaging about their first season, but I don’t feel that at all,” says the actor. “For me, it stood out as a piece of TV that was unlike any any other and they’d written characters that were fully realized and rich.”\n\nAnother Season 3 arrival was newcomer Miriam Petche, playing Pierpoint intern Sweetpea Golightly, a name she admits thinking was “insane” at first — “I thought it was a ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s” reference” — but is now its “fiercest defender.”\n\nBut the “Industry” additions last time around are nothing compared to the latest offering. Alongside Minghella (“The Handmaid’s Tale”), Shipka (“Mad Men”) and Heaton (“Stranger Things”), “Ted Lasso” breakout Toheeb Jimoh joins the ensemble in a sizable role, while Kal Penn appears early on.\n\nCasting director Julie Harkin had worked with Minghella on his 2018 directorial debut, “Teen Spirit,” and says she “chuckled to myself” when she read the role of Whitney Halberstram, the self-assured co-founder of Tender and a man whose snake-oil-salesman qualities — and some considerably shadier elements — slowly rise to the surface. “Max is playful and subtle and has all the dexterity to go to the different places Whitney needs to go — and he’s kind of fearless as well,” she says. Unlike Harington, Minghella hadn’t watch much “Industry” when he signed up, but says it was “massively, massively popular” in his social circle — “my friends are sort of religious about the show, which was terrifying to me.”\n\nFor the character Haley Clay, a doting assistant with more than a provocative edge (and a backstory that emerges later in the season), Harkin says she turned to Shipka because there was “something so incredibly interesting in bringing her a role that goes completely against what audiences have seen her in.” Indeed, anyone who last watched her play Don Draper’s little daughter may well be shocked by where “Industry” takes her (the most recent trailer gives much away).\n\nThanks to the show’s growing status, Harkin says they not only landed all the top casting choices, but she’s now fielding regular pitches from agents eager to get their clients on board.\n\n“You get the U.K. agents ringing you all day, and then as soon as teatime hits, it’s the U.S. It’s hard to keep up with it,” she says. “But yeah, we’ve had a lot of incoming for the show.”\n\n“Whitney is an enigma to everybody, including myself,” says Max Minghella of fintech startup CEO and Season 4 addition Whitney Halberstram. “We continue to figure him out, even after we finished shooting, and figure out where the truth lies, what’s authentic and what’s manipulation. I feel like the lines are so blurred with this character — so much of his desire is tied to some kind of business or strategic warfare.”\n\nEven the music — credited by many to be a core element of the “Industry” DNA — has benefited from the rising popularity. Music supervisor Oliver White, a friend of Down and Kay’s for years, says that in Season 4 they’ve been able to license tracks from top artists that were previously unavailable. “A lot of them have seen the show and have been fans,” he says. Among them is Daft Punk, whose baroque-inspired disco track “Veridis Quo” plays over a nightclub scene with Harper and Yasmin. (White also recalls how the Donna Summer estate was so enthused by how the show deployed “State of Independence” in a Season 2 episode that they sent a note saying it was “one of the best uses they’d seen for the song.”)\n\nBut licensed tracks play second fiddle to the “Industry” score, which is littered with the show’s now near-iconic euphoric and floaty electro, composed by the Berlin-based Canadian Nathan Micay (hired largely because so many of his tracks found their way onto an early Spotify playlist White put together with Down and Kay). Micay’s ability to, as White says, “make the trading floor sound like a dance floor,” meant there were few notes from the showrunners at first, but now he says they’re coming through with suggestions.\n\n“On the last season, the common note I’d get would be ‘Make this sick,’ and on Season 4 it’s been ‘Make me touch God,’” he says. And how does one touch God with the score? “With them at this point I know it just means: Channel the movie ‘Heat.’ Just channel all of ‘Heat’ into a 30-second TV cue.”\n\nWith a three-year exclusive TV deal Down and Kay signed with HBO only 12 months old, it feels like a safe investment — even in the volatile entertainment market — to bet on them coming back for “Industry” Season 5. Kay admits they have an “ending in sight,” and are “starting to write towards the bull’s-eye.”\n\nBut where in the upper echelons of wealth and power they take their hedonistic adventure to reach this conclusion is anyone’s guess — even theirs.\n\n“We don’t know what the fuck is going to happen. We’re constantly making it up as we go along,” says Down. “We never had a big thesis statement about the world or capitalism; we just write what we think is interesting at the time. And that sometimes manifests in weird fucking things.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T16:39:00.288950"}

The show returns for Season 2 a conquering hero, the incumbent winner of the Emmy for outstanding drama series along with a quartet of additional trophies. The awards only cemented a rapturous celebration of “The Pitt” as a return to TV classicism amid the streaming revolution’s upheavals: a 15-episode season, a weekly release and a cast of largely unknowns catapulted to fame by sheer collective chemistry. Katherine LaNasa, Shawn Hatosy and Isa Briones — to name just three standouts from a massive and uniformly excellent cast, with LaNasa and Hatosy Emmy winners alongside star and executive producer Noah Wyle — may not be household names, but they’re now beloved by millions for bringing their characters to beleaguered, adrenalized life over a single shift in a fictionalized emergency room.\n\nYou wouldn’t know any of this from Season 2, though not because the show takes some steep decline in quality. Quite the opposite, in fact: Under the steady leadership of Wyle, creator R. Scott Gemmill and producing director John Wells, “The Pitt” drops us right back into the fray of Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, where each season unfolds hour by hour in close to real time. For the doctors, nurses, social workers and EMTs who make up the staff, it’s just another day at work, which means “The Pitt” doesn’t need to generate new storylines from whole cloth to explain its continued existence. Nor do the unglamorous environs of an overcrowded hospital facilitate a “Stranger Things”-like boost in production value that might wink at the show’s real-world acclaim.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nChanges to the status quo of “The Pitt” are subtle, but they’re apparent to an audience deeply attuned to its workplace dynamics. Wyle’s attending physician Michael “Robby” Rabinovich comes into work on the Fourth of July via motorcycle, a new hobby his colleagues roundly mock him for with good-natured ribbing about midlife crisis. They’d be more harsh if they knew he was lying to them about wearing a helmet, a perfect and passing detail that tells us all we need to know about Robby’s mental state almost a year after the mass shooting at a music festival that spurred the climax of Season 1. (There’s now a memorial plaque in the lobby.) The Fourth is set to be Robby’s final shift before a three-month sabbatical, and the laws of television dictate it can’t be an easy one.\n\nRobby isn’t the only ER staffer at a crossroads. Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball) is back after a forced hiatus to treat a prescription-pill addiction that emerged in highly dramatic fashion last season, and you could cut the tension between him and now-estranged mentor Robby with a scalpel. Dr. Samira Mohan (Supriya Ganesh) is contemplating her personal and professional future at the end of her residency. Once a neophyte student doctor, Dennis Whitaker (Gerran Howell) is now training new pupils himself. Those med students, cocky know-it-all Ogilvy (Lucas Iverson) and acerbic, perceptive Joy (Irene Choi), are drops in a flood of new faces that mark one of the few ways a show set in a single place can meaningfully scale up. Robby clashes with his soon-to-be-replacement, tech evangelist Dr. Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi); case manager Noelle (Meta Golding) consults on how to navigate the labyrinth of Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance; psychiatrist Caleb (Christopher Thornton) sees to patients’ mental health as best he can in an emergency context.\n\nThis being “The Pitt,” however, health care providers and the relationships among them exist only in the context of the people they treat. Just as Noelle and Caleb act as windows into facets of a dysfunctional, patchwork system “The Pitt” didn’t address as directly in Season 1, the cases in Season 2 continue to highlight social issues that inevitably arise from a cross-section of humanity at their lowest moments. A proudly progressive show that serves as a counterpoint to our archconservative political moment, “The Pitt” addresses ICE deportations, fatphobia in medicine, palliative care for terminal cancer, homelessness, the pitfalls of generative AI and the need for ASL interpreters to assist unhearing patients in its new episodes. (Both seasons of “The Pitt” will be available to stream in ASL.) Comic relief is interspersed via drunken injuries and Viagra mishaps, but “The Pitt” remains unabashed in its earnest social consciousness. There’s also a palpable push to up the Pittsburgh-specific material that honors the real place outside the hospital doors, from somber reminders of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting to lighthearted traditions like an annual furry convention.\n\nSuch a wellspring of material is seemingly inexhaustible, though the show strains a bit when working to match the festival shooting as a crucible that pushes its cast to the breaking point. (All the old “24” jokes about how many terrible days Jack Bauer can have still apply.) “The Pitt” instead thrives in quieter moments, especially as the actors ever so slightly modulate their performances to reflect the evolution of their characters. Typically calm Robby is notably snippier and in need of his impending break; veteran charge nurse Dana (LaNasa) is less tolerant of disruption after she was assaulted by a patient in Season 1. Trinity Santos (Briones) hasn’t lost her abrasive edge, but a year of residency has given her real confidence instead of forced bravado. “The Pitt” doesn’t need to show us the months of grind that produced these changes, only their cumulative effect — an act of trust in both the performers and the audience that makes reciprocating easy. It feels good to put oneself back in “The Pitt”’s capable hands.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T16:39:00.660308"}

The 24-year-old New York native, now a decade-long resident of Israel, has finished up film school at Tel Aviv University, created his first short film, won a silver medal for narrative film at the competitive Student Academy Awards for said short film, and recently, that same short film landed a spot on the 2026 Oscars shortlist.\n\nWhat is the name of the short film garnering attention from the industry? Butcher’s Stain. Produced by Oron Caspi and the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at Tel Aviv University, the 14-minute film set, after the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks in Israel and Palestine, follows Samir (Omar Sameer Mahamid), an Arab butcher who finds himself falsely accused of tearing down hostage posters in his company’s breakroom. Under scrutiny and discrimination, Samir tries to prove his innocence and keep the job that he desperately needs to provide for himself and his child.\n\nHere, Levinson-Blount speaks with Deadline about the complications of war and the need for empathy in today’s society.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDEADLINE: Where did this idea come from?\n\nMEYER LEVINSON-BLOUNT: I went to work at a supermarket after the 7th of October. I had just finished my first year of film school [at Tel Aviv University], and I went to work at the supermarket because everything else was closed, so I had to find something to do. During that time, I basically witnessed all of the effects of the war within the supermarket itself, because that place is a microcosm of Israeli society as it has people from different backgrounds [working and shopping inside]. I felt like I witnessed the way that all of Israeli society reacted to the traumatic events of the 7th of October.\n\nWhat really bothered me the most was the reaction that was pointed at the Palestinians who were in Israel. There’s a lot of racism and discrimination from people who don’t want anything to do with Palestinians who are here in Israel. So, I wanted to talk about two things that are sometimes discussed separately for political reasons. Sometimes people talk about the 7th of October. Sometimes people talk about the discrimination against Palestinians. And I really wanted to talk about both of them. As obviously these events transpired and they were awful, but also, that doesn’t justify racism and discrimination against an individual who really had nothing to do with this whole conflict.\n\nDEADLINE: Why was it important to tell the story through the lens of the butcher profession?\n\nLEVINSON-BLOUNT: It’s an obvious choice when you see the film. I think that the important thing to think about when answering this type of question is to think about the contrast between what the butcher character does in physically watching [everyone around him], cutting meat, putting meat away, and the person that he actually is. He’s a very gentle, nice, polite, smart human being, and the idea is to put the stereotype in your face for a second, then show you that it’s absolutely false and has nothing to do with the person. It’s almost like meeting the viewer where he is with what he thinks about a certain group of people, then bursting that bubble. But it’s not only the stereotypes around Palestinians, but it’s also about stereotypes around all types of people. It’s showing you that there are different groups of people trying to make a living and trying to look after their family, and a lot of the time, there really is no basis for all these racist stereotypes that we have in our system.\n\nDEADLINE: How did you find Omar Sameer Mahamid to play Samir?\n\nLEVINSON-BLOUNT: Originally, I contacted my lecturer, who was helping me out, and she set me up with this agent for Palestinian actors. I sent the agent the script, and he read it and showed me Omar. He was like, “This is your guy, do an audition with him.” So, I set up an audition with Omar, and he came in, and that agent was right [laughs]. Initially, Omar had an issue with the filming schedule because he was going to be on vacation during some of the production dates. So, we moved the entire production a month or so, to accommodate him, because it was just that important for me to have him as an actor. There was no one else we saw who was even close to acting on his level or encompassing this character as well as he did. He’s an amazing actor, a very professional person, and a pleasure to work with. He also really taught me a lot about the script.\n\nDEADLINE: What did he teach you about the script? And were there any other logistical challenges for the short?\n\nLEVINSON-BLOUNT: There were lots of challenges. There was still a war going on at the time, so production would stop and start whenever [something happened]. Then there was the challenge of me being a Jewish director and telling this story about a Palestinian within Israel. And even though I had written this script and had the actors read it and really like it, I also had to listen to what the Palestinian actors had to say to direct in a way that authentically respects their story and narrative. We were able to overcome this, though, because the actors were very professional and nice and would explain things to me. For example, in their Arabic scenes, I gave them some text, but they were responsible for making sure everything was said correctly, because I had no idea what they were saying. They had to explain it to me afterwards.\n\nDEADLINE: It’s delicately handled in the film, but you’re still talking about the Gaza War situation. Was there fear in covering this topic at any point along the way?\n\nLEVINSON-BLOUNT: It’s a very controversial issue that’s still talked about worldwide. What bothers me is that it’s so hard to talk about these things on social media, where everyone is just very on edge all the time and at each other’s throats. I wanted to create a respectful dialogue about some of these issues. This was a way to connect with Palestinian Israeli actors and have people meet and talk about things in a way that is actually productive.\n\nDEADLINE: You won the silver medal for best narrative at the 2025 Student Academy Awards and landed the Oscars shortlist. What do you think people are tapping into with your short?\n\nLEVINSON-BLOUNT: I don’t know. This is a very surreal experience for me, as this is my first serious film. Every single step of the way, I’m more excited and more surprised that we’re able to have people like the film so much that they’re voting for it. That’s really an exciting and fantastic experience for me. If I were to guess why it is that we have been able to get to where we are, I think that it’s, as I said, it’s really about talking about an issue in a delicate, emotional, and humane way and not in a political way. I think that when you’re watching a film, you really want to connect with it as a human being. We have politicians and social media for those kinds of conversations, arguments, and all that, and that’s fine. There’s no issue with that. But I think what I wanted to do was really connect the audience on a human level to that community, put you in their shoes, and have the viewer experience that in a humane way, which isn’t supposed to make you uncomfortable. It isn’t supposed to provoke you or get you angry. It’s really only supposed to connect you on a human, emotional level.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T16:39:01.435110"}

The reality format’s celebrity version also performed well, premiering with 7.9M viewers, putting it just outside the top 10.\n\nThe BBC laid claim to half the titles in the table, with Netflix and ITV each picking up two places apiece.

Clarkson’s Farm remained hugely popular with British viewers, while the streamer had a fresh hit in the shape of comedy competition show LOL: Last One Laughing UK. Both series will return in 2026.\n\nOther points of order: there was no place for the final season of Squid Game in the top 10, despite the Korean drama being Netflix’s most-watched franchise in recent years.

Season 4 of Mayor of Kingstown overlapped with new seasons of Landman (Season 2) and Tulsa King (Season 3) being released on Paramount+. Both Landman and Tulsa King have charted on Nielsen’s weekly Top 10 of streaming originals, with Landman also making waves as a Top 3 series on the overall Nielsen chart.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayor of Kingstown, which — like most Sheridan series — is expensive to make, has not broken into Nielsen’s originals Top 10 with its fourth season having done so with previous installments.\n\nStill, it is a Paramount+ legacy show being part of the Taylor Sheridan universe, which led to the decision to pick up a final season, with a six-episode order reportedly discussed before the two sides settled on eight installments.\n\nIn Season 4 of Mayor of Kingstown, Mike’s (Renner) control over Kingstown is threatened as new players compete to fill the power vacuum left in the Russians’ wake, compelling him to confront the resulting gang war and stop them from swallowing the town. Meanwhile, with those he loves in more danger than ever before, Mike must contend with a headstrong new Warden (Falco) to protect his own while grappling with demons from his past.\n\nThe season ended with the gang war in Kingstown escalating to a violent climax in the finale. Sheridan and Dillon will now have eight more episodes to examine the aftermath and tell the rest of the story, which Dillon previously shared they had been prepared to take to seven seasons.\n\n“[Sheridan] has an ending for it in Season 7. Whether it goes that far or that’s where we get [who knows], but he has an ending, and everyone knows about it,” Dillon said in a Screen Rant interview last year. “Our goal is to get to that Season 7, because that’s as far as we can get, because that’s where he’s always had it. 15 years ago, he had it. 15 years ago, ‘So, here’s how it’s starting, Mitch is going to get killed off in the first 10 pages, and season 7, episode 10, this is where Mike’s going to be.”\n\nMitch, played by Kyle Chandler, was Mike’s (Renner) older brother who was famously shot dead in the series’ opening episode.\n\nIn addition to Renner and Falco, the latest season stars Lennie James, Laura Benanti, Dillon, Taylor Handley, Tobi Bamtefa, Derek Webster, Hamish Allan-Headley and Nishi Munshi.\n\nMayor of Kingstown is produced by Paramount Television Studios, 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions. Sheridan executive produces with Dillon, Renner, Antoine Fuqua, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Michael Friedman, Dave Erickson, Christoph Schrewe, Wendy Riss, Evan Perazzo and Keith Cox. Erickson also serves as showrunner. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T16:39:02.078097"}

Shows such as The Traitors Ireland and Dancing with the Stars Ireland will likely benefit.\n\nFox Entertainment Studios, in particular, will be tracking the system, as it produces unscripted shows such as Beat Shazam, Name That Tune and The Floor out of Irish studios. We’ve asked the Irish government and Fox for comment on whether they will qualify.\n\nIn its announcement, Ireland’s Department of Finance noted the tax credit was being introduced “to support the expression of Irish and European culture in the fast-growing unscripted sector and to grow Ireland’s audio-visual industry by attracting international investment as well as encouraging increased activity in the domestic space.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe system has been given European Commission approval to run until December 31, 2028. It will relate to expenditure incurred during program development and be available at a rate of 20% of the lowest eligible expenditure or 80% of the total cost of production. The credit is capped at €15M ($17.5M) per production.\n\nTo be eligible, a production must not cost less than €250,000 and eligible expenditure not fall below €125,000. The production company will have to first apply for an interim cultural certificate, which will confirm the production “is genuinely seeking to promote Irish and European culture.”\n\nThe certificate will allow production companies to claim during the making of a show, not at the end – helping overcome an often-cited criticism of tax relief systems. Once a show is made, the producer will apply for final certification from Ireland’s Minister of Culture, Communication and Sport. This will allow them to make a final claim, which is limited to one season of a project during a 12-month period.\n\n“Unscripted programming is one of the most dynamic and internationally successful parts of the global audio-visual industry, and Ireland has the talent, creativity and production expertise to lead in this space,” said Minister Patrick O’Donovan.\n\n“This new tax credit is about backing Irish storytellers, producers and crews, while ensuring that Irish and European culture is clearly reflected on screens at home and around the world. By being the first in Europe to introduce a dedicated incentive for unscripted production, we are sending a strong signal that Ireland is open, competitive and ambitious when it comes to creative investment and cultural expression.”\n\nSimon Harris, Ireland’s Tánaiste (effectively second-in-command to the Prime Minister), added: “The Tax Credit for Unscripted Production is a natural addition to this and ensures that Ireland remains an extremely competitive location for audio-visual production now and into the future.”\n\nUnscripted production has been challenged around the world. As such, cost efficiencies in Ireland have made it a desirable hub for international productions over the past few years, with Fox among those taking advantage. In the neighboring UK, there have been calls for an unscripted credit for at least the past 18 months, but little movement as of yet.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:56:49 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T17:01:36.304132"}

Cynics wonder whether the car chase really needed to cost that much. But a reality check is needed for those: One Battle After Another was a star-driven project shot in California, a state in dire need of keeping Hollywood production at home. That privilege comes with a cost, as opposed to shooting elsewhere. With the pic inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland, there was no other place to shoot, for as Murphy says, “it’s a California story.”\n\nSays Murphy about the budget that Warner Bros gave the production, “We were not wasteful about it.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nMurphy tells Crew Call, “I feel good about the budget that we had in order to gain the scope that we brought to this film, that’s what makes it feel big and entertaining and unpredictable and unique.”\n\n“We had a good production plan, but it did require a lot of people in California,” says the producer, adding, “I hope that we continue to expand the tax credit here so that we can keep work here.”\n\nAnderson spent several years scouting locations from Eureka to San Diego with his production designer and location manager to find places that organically infiltrated the narrative of the script.\n\nJurgensen shares with us how he stitched together a 2-hour and 40-minute contemporary action comedy, lengthy by all other film standards, into a breathless, snappy, rapid-running movie. He also expounds on Anderson’s decision to shoot in VistaVision and Super 35 as well as the filmmaker’s cinematic references, i.e., The French Connection and Gillo Pontecorvo’s three-time Oscar-nominated The Battle of Algiers.

Disney claimed that its Dish agreement requires monthly subscriptions.

According to O’Leary, the show “changed the elevator pitch forever.” It also made him a celebrity whose blunt ruthlessness cemented him as the Simon Cowell of capitalism.\n\nO’Leary was not an actor, and he insists Mr. Wonderful is not a character. (Yes, it’s really him when he tells an aspiring business owner, “You’re dead to me,” or berates them as a “greedy pig” or “vampire cockroach.”) So, it came as a surprise when, two decades after that breakfast in L.A., he got a call from director Josh Safdie, who was casting “Marty Supreme,” an A24 film centered around a ping pong star played by Timothée Chalamet. Safdie uttered the same magic words as Burnett: “We’re looking for a real asshole.”\n\n©ABC/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nDespite his lack of acting experience, the “Uncut Gems” auteur envisioned O’Leary as the central foe in the movie, a pen-hawking millionaire WASP named Milton Rockwell who spars with Chalamet’s hustler athlete. Safdie asked O’Leary to come to New York to read for the part, but O’Leary refused. “I can’t do it. It’s the middle of summer. I’m sitting on my dock,” he told the director. “I’ll send a plane for you. You come see me.” O’Leary surmised that if Safdie was willing to jet to his lake house in Muskoka just to hear him read for the part, the opportunity must be serious.\n\nSafdie and his co-writer Ronald Bronstein obliged and sent O’Leary the script, which he printed out and left on his home bar. The next morning, O’Leary’s friend, the investment banker Gene McBurney, was outside on his dock, reading the screenplay as the sun peeked over the water. “Have you read this fucking thing?” McBurney asked O’Leary. “Whoever wrote this is a very sick puppy, but you can’t stop turning the pages.”\n\nO’Leary was sold. He read for the part, and his agent soon began negotiating the deal. The “regular Hollywood bullshit” ensued. But O’Leary’s rep wasn’t so sure it was a good career move for him: “He said, ‘I have to be transparent with you. Some of us at UTA are nervous that you’ve never acted before. What happens if you shit the bed?’”\n\n“Marty Supreme” opened wide on Christmas, quickly becoming A24’s second-biggest opening weekend and generating Oscar buzz. Most important for O’Leary, his performance has received raves from critics. “This asshole thing is starting to work for me a little bit,” he smiles.\n\nI first meet O’Leary on an icy morning in Midtown, where he’s just arrived, suitcase in hand, after a weather-delayed flight. He’s wearing a black suit with cufflinks in the shape of skulls, and he shows me a prototype earpiece that translates his texts from five languages, gifted to him by “Shark Tank” co-star Mark Cuban. As O’Leary checks in at the front desk, I offer to grab us a table in the half-vacant hotel restaurant. He shrugs me off with a grin and suggests, “Let’s just do it in the penthouse.”\n\nIn the hotel suite, O’Leary’s wife, Linda, insists I order a coffee and a bite to eat as O’Leary sets up a small camera on a tripod. He films every interview and clips them for his social media pages, he says, pegging a microphone on my jacket. It’s an unusual move that speaks to his passion for video production and also, perhaps, a desire for control.\n\nHe struggles to explain his acting process other than to say he didn’t feel like he was acting at all. When he stepped onto the set with his hairpiece and glasses and red watches — which he’s wearing now, one on each wrist — he simply was Milton. “I just breathed the 1952 air,” he says.\n\nThe first scene he filmed was opposite Chalamet. “We talked about the scene for a couple of minutes, then he’d get up, walk around the camera for a second and come back as Marty Supreme. Sparks are flying off his fingertips,” he says. “The first time we shot, that freaked me out. It never freaked me out again. I knew exactly how he worked, and it was marvelous.” O’Leary is confident that Chalamet will win the Academy Award for best actor.\n\nIn the film, Milton mocks and marvels at Marty. In one particularly memorable scene, O’Leary smacks Chalamet’s bare ass with a ping pong paddle. O’Leary says the scene required 40 takes and shot until 4 a.m., and Chalamet refused to use a butt double because “he didn’t want some other ass immortalized” on screen. When the prop paddle broke after one hit, Chalamet insisted O’Leary use a real one, which left indents on his tush.\n\n“It was easy to beat him up because he was that arrogant little bastard right out of the gate — that assumptive little prick. It was amazing,” O’Leary says.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection\n\nIn another threatening speech, Milton sneers at Marty, “I’m a vampire,” a line O’Leary came up with himself. He pulls up his texts with Safdie and shows me a video he sent the director of him getting into character. “We have a contract … and we sealed it with a paddle,” O’Leary improvises, looking at the iPhone camera. “I was born in 1601 … and I’ve met many Marty Mausers over the centuries.” Safdie and Bronstein loved the immortality quip and worked it into the script.\n\nBut O’Leary and the writers didn’t agree on everything, and he still gripes about the ending of the film, which sees Marty holding his newborn child, tears streaming down his face, overwhelmed, terrified, euphoric. He’s come straight off the plane from Japan, where he sabotaged Milton by refusing to lose an exhibition match against the country’s star table tennis player, Koto Endo (Koto Kawaguchi).\n\n“I told them I was really unsatisfied with the ending, for my character to get fucked over like that. This kumbaya ending is absurd,” O’Leary says. (He circles back to this frustration five or six separate times throughout our conversations.) O’Leary feels that Marty “fucked everybody” in his relentless quest for ping pong success, and “why should he not live a life in misery in perpetuity after that?”\n\nO’Leary believes not only Marty should suffer but his love interest Rachel, played by Odessa A’Zion, should too. He pitched Safdie on an idea: “Rachel has to die. She has to die in childbirth.” (Safdie allegedly considered the suggestion before deciding it was too “sick.”) O’Leary also wanted the film to end with Milton literally biting Marty, and he says Safdie and Bronstein “went as far as to make digital teeth” before nixing the vampiric twist. “I know that sounds nuts, but to me that would be the right punishment,” O’Leary says.\n\nFor O’Leary, “Marty Supreme” marked the first time in decades he was an employee. “I learned my lesson that film sets are not democracies. I’m not used to being told what to do. I do the telling,” O’Leary says. “We shot something 20 times and I said to Josh, ‘OK, I think we got it. We can move on.’ He said, ‘What the fuck are you talking about? There’s no moving on until I say we’re moving on.’”\n\nBefore he built up his nine-figure net worth, Montreal-born O’Leary was a film editor who worked primarily in sports television. Photography is a lifelong passion of his, and he still edits one social media post per week on Premiere Pro, despite having a personal marketing team. (His online portfolio features a dramatic self-portrait in black and white, Canadian landscapes and behind-the-scenes shots of Chalamet.)\n\nWatching Safdie and co. work with Aeroflex cameras, Panavision lenses and 35mm film was a fantasy for O’Leary. But it was also, at times, a pain in the ass.\n\n“I’d never seen such inefficiency. The cinematographer drove me nuts,” he says of Darius Khondji, who required flawless lighting for every scene. Shooting with one camera meant constantly resetting between two characters, and Safdie and Bronstein were “anally insane for perfection.”\n\n“Then I saw the movie and I realized the sheer fucking genius of this guy,” O’Leary says of the director. “Every single frame was perfect. The lighting was perfect. The scenes were perfect.”\n\nIn October, O’Leary suggested in a podcast interview that Safdie could have saved millions of dollars by replacing thousands of extras with artificial intelligence. He maintains that AI can be a useful tool in entertainment for backgrounds. “I used blow-up sex dolls in the stands of hockey arenas when we were shooting so that people didn’t have to freeze for 16 hours,” he says of his TV editing days. “They were slightly out of focus. You couldn’t tell they were sex dolls.”\n\nStill, O’Leary, a bullish investor in AI, rejects that the technology will meaningfully encroach on the work of artists. “I don’t think it’s going to be anytime soon that it’s integrated into filmmaking,” he says. “What makes an actor magic is their lives, who they are and what they mean to the fan base. It’s the same phobia we had when television hit radio. ‘Oh, it’s going to decimate radio!’ No it’s not. The art form exists today, even bigger, terrestrial and in space. To me, AI is just a tool.”\n\nAnd while he says the growth of streaming and decline of theatrical distribution is “obvious” — especially amid Netflix’s impending acquisition of Warner Bros. — O’Leary doesn’t think movie theaters will go away. “I go to these large-screen formats. It’s not just the images, it’s the sound,” he says. “Even in the most expensive home theater — and I’ve got one — there’s no way you can get that same feel. As long as the experience is unique, particularly these new theaters with full bar service, food service, incredible sofa-like chairs in a giant room with perfect sound and 70mm size screen, you can’t beat it.”\n\nDisney\n\nWe’re past our allotted time at the hotel, and O’Leary’s phone won’t stop buzzing. “Let’s keep going,” he says, flipping the device face-down on the coffee table. “We’re in a groove here.” But eventually, he hits the answer button. It’s his publicist, and he’s late for other interviews. “OK, OK. OK,” he says, hurriedly. “Got it. Got it. OK. I’m going. I’m going. I’m going right now.” He looks at me, without cracking a smile, and says: “We’re fucked.”\n\nLinda brings over O’Leary’s breakfast — scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and gluten free toast — and I wolf down some berries before scurrying out of the penthouse. As O’Leary preps for his junket interviews, I ask if doing press for a movie is a thrill or a chore. His wife answers for him: “He’s having the most fun of his life.”\n\nO’Leary is keen on growing his Hollywood career. Even before “Marty Supreme” arrived in theaters, he had already received a couple of offers from directors and producers who saw early previews of the film. He’s going to wait until the promotional cycle ends before deciding what to do next. “I’ve definitely caught the bug, and I want to see how diverse I can be in terms of what roles I play,” he says.\n\nStill, there’s one part in particular he has his eyes on.\n\n“My whole life, since I was a teenager, I’ve wanted to be the bad guy in a Bond movie,” O’Leary says. “I want to blow shit up. I could blow a lot of shit up.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T18:42:41.119175"}

The CPB announced Monday that its board of directors voted to close the organization after 58 years, rather than continue to exist and potentially be “vulnerable to future political manipulation or misuse.”\n\nThe CPB was created by Congress by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 to support the federal government’s investment in public broadcasting. The org noted that the rescission of all of CPB’s federal funding came after years of political attacks.\n\n“For more than half a century, CPB existed to ensure that all Americans—regardless of geography, income, or background—had access to trusted news, educational programming, and local storytelling,” said CPB president/CEO Patricia Harrison. “When the Administration and Congress rescinded federal funding, our Board faced a profound responsibility: CPB’s final act would be to protect the integrity of the public media system and the democratic values by dissolving, rather than allowing the organization to remain defunded and vulnerable to additional attacks.\n\n\n\nCPB Board of Directors chair Ruby Calvert called the move — and what has happened to public media — “devastating.”\n\n\n\n“After nearly six decades of innovative, educational public television and radio service, Congress eliminated all funding for CPB, leaving the Board with no way to continue the organization or support the public media system that depends on it,” Calvert said. “Yet, even in this moment, I am convinced that public media will survive, and that a new Congress will address public media’s role in our country because it is critical to our children’s education, our history, culture and democracy to do so.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe news doesn’t come as a surprise after the Republican Congress in July approved Trump’s rescission package, eliminating $1.1 billion in crucial funding for public broadcasting that had been approved for the next two years. Without that money, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was set to shut down. And the fate of hundreds of TV and radio stations remains up in the air.\n\n\n\nThe funding was used to support both public radio and public television stations, directing over 70 percent of CPB’s appropriation straight to local stations. The funds also supported independent filmmakers. Without the funds, PBS has been scrambling to support and protect some of its most vulnerable member stations. Some stations have announced plans to shut down; Arkansas’ PBS stations disaffiliated with the service and went independent to save money.\n\n“CPB’s support extends to every corner of the country—urban, rural, tribal, and everywhere in between,” the org noted.” In many communities, public media stations are the only free source of trusted news, educational children’s programming, and local and national cultural content.”\n\n\n\nThe CPB said that without funding, its board determined that “maintaining the corporation as a nonfunctional entity would not serve the public interest or advance the goals of public media. A dormant and defunded CPB could have become vulnerable to future political manipulation or misuse, threatening the independence of public media and the trust audiences place in it, and potentially subjecting staff and board members to legal exposure from bad-faith actors.”\n\nAs it closes, CPB is distributing its remaining funds, and also supporting the American Archive of Public Broadcasting in digitizing and preserving historic content. The CPB’s own archives will be preserved at the University of Maryland, which will make it accessible to the public.\n\nIn September, the Television Academy honored CPB with its Governors Award, presenting it to Harrison , who had led the organization since 2005, at the Creative Arts ceremony.\n\n“Public media remains essential to a healthy democracy,” Harrison added. “Our hope is that future leaders and generations will recognize its value, defend its independence, and continue the work of ensuring that trustworthy, educational, and community-centered media remains accessible to all Americans.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:49:26 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:02:53.242484"}

Directed by Mona Fastvold, who co-wrote the script with Brady Corbet, her husband and filmmaker behind last year’s Oscar-nominated The Brutalist, Ann Lee won the Silver Lion for Best Director at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nThe Testament of Ann Lee, is an epic musical retelling of the life of the 18th century Shaker founder starring Amanda Seyfried as the religious leader. The film explores the radical origins of the devotional sect known for its ecstatic worship and egalitarian beliefs.\n\nThe pic had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and soon after was acquired by Searchlight. It was nominated for Best Feature at the Gotham Awards, while Seyfried scored Best Actress noms from the Gothams, Golden Globes and the Critics Choice awards. It hit theaters December 25.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe film’s narrative is structured into three distinct acts that track the major transitions of Lee’s life, beginning with her impoverished upbringing in pre-industrial Manchester, England. In this first chapter, the story depicts the personal tragedy of Lee losing her four children at a young age, a trauma that serves as the catalyst for her spiritual transformation. She begins preaching that holiness can only be attained through celibacy and the renunciation of traditional marriage, views that eventually lead to her being declared a heathen and confined to a mental asylum. While imprisoned, Lee experiences visions that lead her to believe she is the female reincarnation of Christ and God’s representative on Earth.\n\nThe film’s second act follows Lee and a small group of devoted followers — including her husband Abraham, brother William and the loyal Sister Mary — on a transatlantic journey to the New World in 1774. This transition from the claustrophobic reality of Manchester to the open air of the Atlantic sets the stage for the final chapter: the building of a utopian community in America. Settling in Albany County, New York, the Shakers establish the colony of Niskayuna, a society governed by rigid guidelines of celibacy, social equality and a pursuit of perfection through labor. The film culminates in 1784 with Lee’s death at age 48, following a violent attack on the community by neighbors threatened by their radical lifestyle.\n\nCentral to the film is the theme of radical feminism, with Fastvold portraying Lee as a wild feminist leader who was overlooked by history despite her early advocacy for gender and social equality. By offering a way out of the restrictive Church of England, Lee’s movement provided a sanctuary for those who did not fit into mainstream society. This quest for utopia is depicted as a yearning for communal grace and justice, which Fastvold likens to the creative impulse found in all artistic endeavors.\n\nThe film further explores the theme of spiritual ecstasy through movement and song, functioning as a full-on musical where worship is expressed through shaking, trembling and exuberant acts of devotion. These movements were not merely physical but also were intended as embodied expressions of faith and shared experience. Additionally, the rigidity and rules of Shaker life served as a form of redemption and safety for individuals like Lee who had endured profound grief. This connection between labor, craftsmanship and spirituality is woven throughout the film, reflecting the Shaker philosophy that shaping the world through work was itself a form of transcendence.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:11:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:33:09.968032"}

For Aubrey O’Day, who Diddy signed to his girl group Danity Kane as part of “Making the Band” in the early aughts, it was the culmination of years of speaking out about her former boss and the trauma she’s endured.\n\n“Today, I have this fear of the grieving process or putting things together or living with the limited perspective I have now, understanding the full context through the documentary and with the world watching,” she tells Variety. “When I woke up early this morning, all of these thoughts were starting to consume my mind.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nO’Day, 41, is discussing her participation in the documentary — which was directed by Alexandria Stapleton and executive produced by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson — just days after wrapping the 2025 dates of Danity Kane’s “The Untold Chapter Tour” in late December, a reunion that saw her taking the stage once again with D. Woods and Aundrea Fimbres. She explains that she didn’t realize how overwhelming it would be to revisit the foundation of her music career amid the release of the documentary, in which she shares how Diddy fired her from the group for rebuffing his sexual advances and, in a shocking moment, reads an affidavit from a woman who claims she witnessed Diddy sexually assaulting her while she was inebriated.\n\nBut, as she says, O’Day is using her appearance on the documentary to open up conversations about abuse not just in the music industry, but beyond. “I’m overall wanting the behavior to stop across the board,” she says. “We’re having open discussions to this day about behaviors that are very similar. And I’m wondering what we as a society are going to do about them.”\n\nYou were one of the first people to be vocal publicly about Sean Combs. It’s been going on for years, and the reaction may not have always been as warm or supportive as it is now. Do you feel a sense of vindication in all of this?\n\nYou know, I’ve gone back to that so much and my answer is, yes, I have been speaking out for 20 years. I did it in ways that I could based on the things that I had to sign contractually to get out of my 360 deal. I did it a lot less then. I started over the years as I started to understand myself and build my own career away from “Making the Band” and Danity Kane and Diddy. I started to understand the power of my voice differently, and so I spoke bigger about it.\n\nBut even when I look back at something like “Celebrity Apprentice,” this clip always comes back around during election time where Trump is praising Diddy and saying he’s the greatest guy and encouraging me to say that as well — and I refuse to say it. And I noticed even then I wasn’t so far removed from that situation, but I wasn’t willing to compromise my integrity even in front of a man that had all the power. So I think it’s been very consistent.\n\nWatching your part of the docuseries was, frankly, very difficult, not only because of what you’re talking about, but also watching you share that with the world. Why was it important for you to read the affidavit publicly?\n\nSo when this whole thing occurred, the very first thing that happened in my world is every single person that was making a documentary ran straight to me and offered me the world. And I would have conversations, and I would notice, “Oh, these people are just wanting to make a hit piece on Diddy. These people seem interesting, but I’ve spoken with all the producers and I’ve asked to meet all of the editing bay and there is no Black representation here. How would they ever be able to tell a culture piece and not have any representation on the production side or the editing bay?” I didn’t trust that.\n\nI was talking with Alex a lot about everything, and she was kind of the last one that came through and had her deal with Netflix. And then she was the last person that got to me. But when I got on with her, she’s just such an incredible, incredible human. The way that she listened to me, the way that she validated the things that I said, the way that she listened to the things that had happened to me prior to doing the documentary and advised me that I’m not experiencing the way that doing a documentary on this project would look. It almost sounded like I’m experiencing what a reality TV version of this would look like, which I’m very used to.\n\nSo when I spoke with her, she had such patience, respect. She knew and understood. She knew all of the connections. She knew the world. And she’s a woman that has a lot of pressure on her being a mixed woman. She spends her life doing culture pieces and having people wonder if she’s the right person to do it. She’s got a smaller production company. And so to put that much on her back and for her to be part of, I mean, you’ve seen how huge this documentary has become. And it is a statement of the culture, of the industry, and of a time and place in which a lot of things were going unchecked. I just saw that Netflix was willing to take its time and that she was taking her job of telling this piece of history with a lot of integrity and she was being very careful. I wanted to be on a documentary that was going to tell a through story of a man’s life, good and bad.\n\nWhat was your reaction when you were first given the affidavit?\n\nThe first thing I did was verify everything that I was told that this woman was. Who she was, how many kids she had, or what she does for a living, or her degrees. I wanted to make sure, as the daughter of a lawyer — my stepdad was a lawyer too, so of lawyers — that I did my due diligence in understanding that this person is real. And when I got that concerned was right around the time that [the authorities] reached out to me and wanted to meet with me. So the problem was for me, when you speak with them, they tell you two things when they leave, which is, don’t tell anyone that you’ve met with us, obviously, until you’ve been subpoenaed or you’re not being subpoenaed and the trial is over. And two, can’t speak to victims because you can drastically create errors in the case if you’re talking with other victims. What if both of you need to take the stand? There can be no communication between two people or else you could have compromises to the actual trial. And so at that point it was, if you wanted to even investigate this, it’s a non-starter.\n\nSo I just started reading every civil lawsuit. One thing I noticed in all of them is these instances in which they start feeling woozy. There were instances throughout all of them in which these details occurred and I just kept trying to find myself in any of them. Find anything in them that made sense to me like, oh, I had that feeling too. But it was very difficult to sift through a lot of those lawsuits. Some of them are so horrific. I would be feeling sick over it for days. And when the conversations that were had with this woman over a multiple-year period of time, her story never changed once, and she was speaking with people who did not discuss knowing me. And this is all happening as [Aundrea] called me and said she found me on “Masked Singer” [in early 2025] and wants to sing again. So I’m trying to get an agent to put a tour together and bring all of these girls back. But I’m also secretly suffering in this whole world. And I didn’t even realize when combining the worlds how absolutely horrific it would be for me, for my mental health.\n\nWhat do you think is going to happen to Sean Combs once he’s out of prison and this part of his life is behind him?\n\nI am unsure that the amount of time that he’s going to be in prison is enough to fully, solely do the type of work that you would need to become a better person and to — how do I say this? To heal into the type of person that could be effective and good going back into life, and I’m mostly worried that a lot of money and a great spin team could create the idea that he has once again recreated a new version of himself. And that worries me, because there are people that will always be around to be able to potentially be pulled into that.\n\nYou were saying how you didn’t realize that doing this reunion and dealing with the docuseries rollout at the same time would be a lot to handle. Regarding the timing of the reunion, was it done with the intention of creating a new path forward following what you’ve been through these past few years, or is it just that the timing worked out that way?\n\nI was feeling like it can’t just end here for all of the artists that went through so much. So my thought was being able to end the year on seeing the artists come back and shine, having nothing to do with him. He didn’t build it. He didn’t create it. He didn’t put the show together. Like being able to still show resilience after such a traumatic period of time for so many people, whether you knew him or not, it was so palpable. The trial was so palpable. The behaviors were so palpable. So many people who have been abused in this world in any shape or form, they all were just feeling really heavy. So I thought that this tour would be a good way of closing out the year and really bringing it back to the music and to the reason why all of us showed up in the first place.\n\nYou teased the reunion with silhouettes. People were unsure of who was going to be on the actual stage. Dawn Richard said publicly that she didn’t know about the reunion. What sort of conversations happened behind the scenes to get it into the formation that people have been seeing at these shows?\n\nSo I reached out to Dawn to come back. It originally started with an agent reaching out to everyone. When I saw her release that, I had reached out and said, “Come back.” The reason I don’t post the receipts or get into it is that we go right back into that divisive Diddy mentality of chaos. And I don’t want to revisit that. The whole point was to not revisit that. And so I just have always kind of let her know a few different times, you are welcome back. I kept the shadows on our initial announcement, because I hadn’t even signed the contract at that point, let alone if any other girls wanted to come forward, we could make room and make it happen. There was a bandmate that did not want Dawn back. There was certain things that were occurring, but for me personally, the motto of Danity Kane is every single time, everyone is invited back. I’ll listen to everybody and I’ll hear them out, but I want everyone to come and speak to each other and where it’s solved is where it should fall. And that’s how it should have been done. And it didn’t get done that way. And that’s not anything that I had anything to do with.\n\nBut I have reached out to her multiple times. And of course, I mentioned her and Shannon on the stage. I was able to get Shannon to still be part of the show, even though she’s retired. But I just think that when you’re made under Diddy, there’s just so much that he did to each individual person. Everybody experiences it in different ways, and certain people got it way heavier than others, as the documentary tells the world. And I think that when you build something in an unhealthy environment, that I’m not sure that it ever gets to a place where it isn’t thick.\n\nNow that the tour is coming to an end, have you discussed recording new music? Is that something that’s been on your mind?\n\nNo.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:48:57 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:53:43.803914"}

Then, Probst quickly moved onto designing the season’s theme.\n\nAs revealed in the first trailer for this season, “In the Hands of the Fans” will include twists featuring Billie Eilish and Jimmy Fallon, and cameos from Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson and Zac Brown.\n\nBut don’t fret, “Survivor” loyalists: Probst isn’t losing the plot.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Once we committed to turning the game design over to the fans, the next question became: ‘How far can we go with this idea!?’” the host and showrunner tells Variety. “We knew some of ‘Survivor’s’ biggest fans happen to be celebrities, so we thought sprinkling a few of them in with their own unique twists felt like a fun way to make the game even more unpredictable! It definitely caught the players off guard in some really exciting ways, and added another layer to this celebratory season.”\n\nThis is the largest cast to ever play, and the castaways will, as always, be the real stars of the season — even when there are game-changing twists with celebrities attached. Variety was on set in Fiji for two of the collaborations, and can confirm that “Survivor” still feels like “Survivor,” even when A-list names are attached.\n\n“I think it’s a legitimate concern when you start adding layers like celebrities, that they can overshadow the game and take it off course. Our job was to make sure that we stayed true to what we’re doing on ‘Survivor,’ which is exploring this continuous social experiment. And now we’re adding another layer,” Probst says. “And when you bring in a celebrity like Zac Brown or MrBeast or Jimmy Fallon, you now add idolatry, and you add different perceptions and reputations. Suddenly, people can get off track a little bit, or they lean in, and they want something to do with Jimmy Fallon. A lot of the players said, ‘I’ve always dreamed of being in a MrBeast video.’ So the twist is designed to see if you can stay on course with the thought process you should — or how is it going to shift your thought process, and will it do you in?”\n\nHe also adds that he didn’t go out to celebrities and ask who wanted to be involved — it was through his own friendships and relationships that each collaboration came about. And it was the celebrity’s idea.\n\n“With Jimmy Fallon, it was on his show. Jimmy texts me ideas all the time about ‘Survivor,’ and we put some of them in the show, and we’ve always talked about this idea,” Probst says. That idea, for now, won’t be shared — but it is an exciting one, which is hinted at during the trailer, and didn’t go at all how Probst thought it would. “I think people will see, when they see these play out, I think they’ll understand these are legit ‘Survivor’ fans who wanted to be a part of 50.”\n\nThe biggest collab of the season, however, will be the one with MrBeast; Probst appears on Season 2 of “Beast Games” and Donaldson shows up for something on Season 50 of “Survivor.” The cameos were filmed days apart from each other in June in Fiji.\n\nThe crossover conversation began when Lori DelliColli, VP of communications at CBS, was eating breakfast, and her kids showed her a MrBeast video. One of his team members, Karl Jacobs, was wearing a “Survivor” buff and talking about the show. She flagged to the marketing team, who invited Jacobs, along with “Beast Games” co-creator Sean Klitzner, to participate in the influencer experience filmed ahead of Season 49.\n\nNo one knew at the time just how big of fans they were of the franchise. Executive producer Matt Van Wagenen recalls Klitzner applying and getting close to being cast on an earlier season. In 2020, Jacobs DM’d Van Wagenen on Twitter (as it was then), raving about the show. Van Wagenen mailed him a crew T-shirt and when Jacobs posted it on social media, the producer started hearing from friends and family. He had no idea how big Jacobs’ following was. Once they re-met in Fiji, “it felt like this was a conversation we never finished,” Van Wagenen says.\n\nDuring the influencer experience, Klitzner pitched Probst on some sort of collaboration — and “the camaraderie was instant; my respect for them was instant,” says Probst. “And then it was Lori’s idea to say, ‘That felt like some synergy there.’ We’ve never said, ‘Let’s collaborate with another show.’ Ever. We are our own tiny little world trying to just stay out of the way, and do our show.”\n\nA main part of the crossover, though, was logistics; the calendar for “Survivor” Season 50 and “Beast Games” Season 2 were already set. But the Prime Video reality competition series was willing to bend: They all wanted to make it work.\n\n“I said, ‘Jeff, if you really want to do this, ‘I’ll push my entire shoot. I’ll fit your dates no matter what,’” says Klitzner. “We had a kick-off meeting where they pitched us what we should do for our show. They said, ‘We don’t want to overstep.’ We said, ‘We want you to overstep in every sense of the word.’ They said they could shoot it with their crew and could build challenges. They came in, designed everything from soup to nuts. And of course, then our team came in, and we put ‘Beast’ into it… There was not one moment that Jeff went, ‘I don’t know if we can do this.'”\n\nJeff Probst on “Beast Games” Season 2\n\nThough “Beast Games” and “Survivor” are both reality competition shows, they have very little in common.\n\n“They have a chaotic approach. They have cameras everywhere; they break the fourth wall all the time. They talk to players whenever they want. It’s a completely different form of storytelling, and it works,” Probst says. And Donaldson is a very different type of host from Probst. “He’s not focused on a longer-term story. He seems more focused on an in-the-moment reaction, and they bounce from one reaction to another, to another. It’s similar to his online environment, which is this constant hit of another moment, another event, one after another. “On ‘Survivor,’ we’re looking at the long game. We want to introduce you to somebody, let you know who they are, where they’re from, what their vulnerabilities are, and then we add things to the game to exacerbate that uncertainty and force adaptability.”\n\nAnd Donaldson’s style was “exhilarating” for Probst to see, allowing him a look into such a different production than he’s used to. “Who knows what influence I will take from that?” Probst says. “I’m sure in some ways, I will take things from my time with Jimmy and go, ‘I could use some elements of that in ‘Survivor.’”\n\nIn a way, it was “like I was in a video game and just trying to keep up,” Probst says of being part of the “Beast Games” episode. “He just goes wherever he wants. He, like me, is the producer of his show. He can decide to do whatever he wants, and he does. He doesn’t hesitate to say, ‘I think I’ll just bribe you with money right now.’ It was fascinating to be inside their world and watch them.”\n\nOf course, having Probst by his side was a huge learning experience for Donaldson — both as a host and as a producer. After the first part of the collab is filmed, Donaldson says: “I’m a little more monotone. Jeff projects his voice, and has a swag with certain things — like Island swag! I would love to have more presence with my voice like he does.”\n\nFrom a producer’s standpoint, Donaldson realized while in Fiji that maybe “Beast Games” has “over-indexed on changing things. He’s essentially done similar vibes for 25 years, and it’s still cool. People like familiarity, and I usually try to mix things up, but that makes the production way harder,” says Donaldson. “It’s helped me realize that not everything has to be fresh, because sometimes fans just like things, and if they like it, do it over and over again.”\n\nBut after figuring out how “Survivor” would be incorporated into “Beast Games,” it came time for Probst to figure out how to mix MrBeast into his show.\n\n“The key point for me was, our show is not changing. Jimmy will come in, and we’ll bring the aspects of ‘Beast Games’ that we want to explore on our show,” says Probst. “If you look at the two shows, ‘Beast Games’ asks one question: What will people do for money? ‘Survivor’ asks a different question: Who are you when you’re stripped of everything?”\n\nWhat Donaldson’s role is in “Survivor” 50 needs to stay secret for now, other than what’s shown in the trailer: He shows up with his briefcase. Let’s just say, what’s inside has major potential to change the game.\n\n“When you take people who are being stripped of everything,” Probst says, “and then you bring in maybe the most well-known person for unpredictable moments, it took the uncertainty to another level.”\n\n“Survivor” premieres on CBS Feb. 25 at 8 p.m. ET.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:43:34 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:53:44.129144"}

To that point, she continued, “Nobody wants to see the same ad three times.” Most ad content, she added, “is dead on arrival after a week, maybe two weeks. … We’ve talked about a promo taking two-plus weeks to execute. Now with AI – and with I want to put the word ‘responsible AI’ out there – you can do it in hours.\n\nProgrammers and advertisers are “in a fight for attention,” Elsakr said. “So, being able to be relevant and let the fan drive the narrative, that, to me, is the new definition of personalization of the brand.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nKristina Shepard, EVP of Streaming & Performance Sales & Partnerships at NBCU cited a number of initiative at the media giant that are designed to take advantage of the speed of AI tools.\n\nBuyers and sellers of ad time can now use AI “to get down, not just to a show or an episode, but to a scene level,” Shepard said. “Contextual targeting in some regard has gotten a bad rap because it has seemed very basic, right? An advertiser would say, ‘I want to reach women 25 to 54, give me the top 100 shows.’ Now, AI can allow us to actually identify scenes. For example, there might be an advertiser who wants to be the first ad in an ad pod right after a holiday kiss. How do we make that advertiser really, really relevant in that moment?”\n\nAI can create “a great marriage between the viewer and the advertiser experience,” Shepard added. “We basically beta-tested this with a luxury brand, you know, doing contextual targeting in VOD content in 2026, you’ll see this in live” at upcoming NBCU events like the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics.\n\nOne scenario, she said, would be enabling creative messages to allude to what is happening in a live sporting event. “Imagine a touchdown happens in the third quarter of a game and that next ad pod says, ‘Congratulations for the touchdown brought you by said brand.'”\n\nIn the case of the luxury brand, she added, NBCU research found that viewers got 27% more enjoyment from that experience, and search engagement jumped 56% for the brand. Search and purchase intent, the so-called “lower funnel” parts of the advertising experience (as opposed to upper-funnel efforts to create awareness), are “the holy grail for all advertisers,” Shepard said. NBCU’s experience “shows the benefit that television can be both an upper and lower funnel medium.”\n\nSamira Panah Bakhtiar, General Manager of Media & Entertainment, Games, and Sports at AWS, pointed to the larger context in which all viewing and advertising is occurring.\n\n“I think we have to think about where the audiences are,” she said. “Gen Z right now is spending 54% more time on social and they’re spending 26% less time on traditional viewing experiences. And if you look at some of the creators right now who are really able to capitalize themselves in a marvelous way.” She cited Dude Perfect or Mr. Beast, whose valuations are “rivaling more traditional brands.”\n\nThe emergence of creators “isn’t just an anomaly. These are creators who have very, very loyal fan bases who have learned how to be able to really cultivate production level content and higher media executives and get institutional investment and have figured out ways to be able to only create that content, but distribute that content at scale.”\n\nAny companies “seeking this to reinvent themselves, or be able to capitalize on this moment,” she said, need to “really pay attention to the multi-generational preferences that exist in the viewing sphere right now.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:33:19 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T19:53:45.861368"}

But the Oscar-winning filmmaker recoils at being called a visionary. “It’s not like you’re in a recliner with somebody feeding you grapes, going, ‘I see a castle,’” del Toro tells his friend Bradley Cooper when they meet in Variety’s midtown Manhattan [&#8230;]", "content": "Guillermo del Toro is known for his painstakingly crafted tales of monsters and ghosts. But the Oscar-winning filmmaker recoils at being called a visionary. “It’s not like you’re in a recliner with somebody feeding you grapes, going, ‘I see a castle,’” del Toro tells his friend Bradley Cooper when they meet in Variety’s midtown Manhattan studio.\n\nThe point del Toro is making is there’s a lot of hard, unglamorous work that goes into bringing movies to life — from hiring the right actors to making decisions on the fly when budgets are tight and time is running short. His latest sumptuously produced epic, “Frankenstein,” is a project he struggled for decades to bring to the screen before Netflix agreed to greenlight a $130 million horror film where the creature (Jacob Elordi) is more sympathetic than his creator (Oscar Isaac). It’s a film that reflects del Toro’s own turmoil and pain.\n\nCooper, who starred in del Toro’s 2021 film “Nightmare Alley,” sees his latest directorial effort, “Is This Thing On?,” as a similarly personal project. It’s the story of a middle-aged man (Will Arnett) who discovers a love for stand-up when his marriage collapses. It also gave Cooper a chance to show a deeper, more sensitive side of Arnett, a close friend famous for broadly comedic turns in “Arrested Development” and “The Lego Movie.”\n\nBradley Cooper: I think Warren Beatty said this: Casting is plot.\n\nGuillermo del Toro: That’s a great way of putting it. I was talking about that the other day with Al Pacino. If you do Shakespeare and all of a sudden you cast a Hamlet in his 50s, that changes everything.\n\nCooper: You’ve been obsessed with “Frankenstein” since you were a kid. These characters have been gestating inside you. This idea of casting is plot — how does that relate to finding Oscar Isaac?\n\nDel Toro: When you read the book, Victor is a young, brilliant student. But I was fascinated by this idea of a person in their 30s who was stuck in their teens. The point of the character for me is that after his mother died when he was a child, he grew intellectually, he grew socially, but he stopped growing emotionally. Also, I wanted Oscar to not belong completely to the family of his father; I wanted him to be frowned upon because his skin was darker, his hair was unruly, and he had this fiery temperament. I wrote it for him.\n\nYou came to “Is This Thing On?” after it was developed?\n\nCooper: But I rewrote it. And much like you, I wrote it for Will Arnett and Laura Dern and where they are in their lives.\n\nDel Toro: Both movies are strangely auto­­biographical.\n\nCooper: Don’t you think if we’re doing our jobs properly, everything’s autobiographical?\n\nBenedict Evans for Variety\n\nDel Toro: People say, “Oh, you identify with the creature.” In the past, yes. Now I identify with the creator. I’m the antagonist of my own story, as well as the protagonist.\n\nCooper: I know you, so I identify you throughout the film.\n\nDel Toro: That’s the biography.\n\nYou operated the camera on your film?\n\nCooper: I did wind up operating the camera for the lion’s share of filming, which created an environment with the actors that was special. I was able to keep the flow going.\n\nDel Toro: Did you talk to them from behind the camera?\n\nCooper: I would shout lines or ask them to explore something.\n\nDel Toro: You were like David O. Russell?\n\nCooper: I learned so much from him [on “Silver Linings Playbook,” “American Hustle” and “Joy”]. He expanded my horizons about what it can be like in a creative environment on a set. I took to that way of making movies.\n\nWhat [you and I] share is that we love this so much. We love every aspect.\n\nDel Toro: When people talk about filmmaking visionaries, I go, “Well, it’s hard work and it’s hardware.” You have to build it; you have to film it with a certain lens. You have to decide between a Steadicam or a handheld. The decision is precision.\n\nCooper: Both of our movies take chances structurally and trust the audience. Where the camera is has everything to do with how the viewer relates to the story. In “Is This Thing On?” you don’t see a full shot of our main character’s face until about 20 minutes into the movie. It’s all profiles or three-quarter shots until he gets up on that stage, finally turns and says, “I’m getting a divorce.” I wrote it into the script, and the studio was trepidatious about the idea of not seeing your main character. And I said, “It will work because hopefully the audience won’t know it cerebrally, but they’ll feel like all of a sudden there he is.”\n\nI love the scene in “Frankenstein” where you have the monster hiding behind this wall, looking at the blind man’s house.\n\nDel Toro: The moment where he crosses from his hiding place into the house, the camera crosses with him through the set. All of a sudden, he’s in a completely different environment. It’s the widest shot of the scene, so that when we enter the house, it’s magical.\n\nThat happened to me at the Academy Awards. When I got the Oscar for “Shape of Water,” people asked, “How does it feel?” I said, “Well, you’re in your seat and then you climb up to the stage and turn around and go, ‘What is this?’” All of a sudden, you’re in your dream moment in the shower as a kid rehearsing your speech with the shampoo bottle.\n\nThe monster needed to feel like that. He enters the house, and it needs to feel like a palace. Everything we did is 99% anchored in practical elements. We wanted to build giant sets. We wanted to build a massive ship on real motors.\n\nCooper: Which is incredible.\n\nDel Toro: You want to stage everything so that that world exists in a way that feels natural. [But] you have to be able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nBenedict Evans for Variety\n\nCooper: Things can just pass you by — these wonderful gifts — and if you’re not looking, you’re not going to see them.\n\nDel Toro: One detail can change everything, and you have to identify those accidents. I ordered oversized irises for Jacob Elordi to make his eyes more animalistic. So those are scleral contact lenses; they’re large and troublesome. He put one on and the other hurt, and he says, “I can’t put in the two lenses. Let’s do it digitally.” And I said, “No, let’s keep two different sizes of eyes, and the bigger eye is going to reflect back the light, and I’m going to use it to show when he’s angry.”\n\nCooper: It wound up being an incredible story weapon.\n\nDel Toro: If you’re playing chess with reality, you will lose. That’s true of every filmmaker that has ever lived, even when they create their entire world, like Jim Cameron. What was fascinating about the “Avatar” [movies] is the more control he has over the world, the more he can be loose with the actors. On the most recent movie, you see how much he’s improvising.\n\nCooper: Yes, 100%. It’s funny, the more structured I am, the freer the actors feel.\n\nDel Toro: How do you choose the movies you direct?\n\nCooper: It sounds hokey, but they choose me. It takes so much work and energy; it has to be something that feels slightly otherworldly to harness what it takes to see it through. For each movie that I’ve directed, I asked, “What’s the nuclear weapon?” With “A Star Is Born,” there’s no better way to tell a love story than two people singing, because you cannot hide your emotions. And then Gaga was the nuclear weapon. For “Maestro,” it was being obsessed with conducting since I was a kid. But then the nuclear power was finding Leonard Bernstein.\n\nDel Toro: And for “Is This Thing On?”\n\nCooper: It was Will Arnett. Here is this guy who is like Robert Mitchum. He’s 6’4”. His voice is what you would dream of having.

Every day he was uncomfortable. It was about trusting me.\n\nDel Toro: People say, “Why did you choose this movie?” I say, “Listen, I’ve written 42 screenplays; I’ve made 13 movies.” It’s not like I said, “Oh, no, I’ll do that one now.” It’s which project can I get produced.\n\nCooper: When we made “Nightmare Alley,” we both had other obsessions.\n\nDel Toro: But because we made it, I got to make “Frankenstein” and you made “Maestro.” We approached the character that you played in “Nightmare Alley” as being the worst and the best of us, [which helped me on “Frankenstein”].

A neighbor becomes upset at the noise, and drama ensues.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the clip finds bringing “five out of six of his ‘Don’t Be Dumb’ alter egos to life: Rocky portraying GR1M, Tommy Revenge as RUGAHAND, Thoto as BABUSHKA BOI, the Williams twins as SHIRTHEAD, and DUMMY appearing alongside them.” Along with Ryder, it also stars Danny Elfman, Thundercat, and A$AP Nast.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe video was directed by Rocky alongside Folkert Verdoorn and Simon Becks (collectively known as the Three Musketeers), was produced by Magna Studios, Freenjoy, and AWGE.\n\nThe song, a relatively low-key indie-rock groove, doesn’t quite match the unhinged performance in the video, but it’s cool on its own as well.

Comcast announced about a year ago plans to separate declining linear cable assets its core broadband business and the rest of NBCUniversal.\n\nThe spinoff delivered Comcast stockholders with 1 share of Versant for every 25 shares of Comcast in hand. A downturn in Versant stock was expected as index funds and other investors primarily interested in holding Comcast cycle out and it could take a few weeks or more for the shares to settle with a true read on investor sentiment.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAt a recent investor day, CEO Mark Lazarus and his team described plans to grow the new company beyond cable. Versant initially expects to generate $6.7 billion in revenue with 62% coming from linear distribution, 23% from advertising, 13% from its digital platforms and 3% from content licensing and other. It also expects $2.3 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and $1.5 billion in free cash flow\n\nIt debuts with $3 billion in gross debt, $750 million in cash on hand and 1.5 billion in total liquidity.\n\nThe spin is being closely watched as a statement on the future of cable, which throws off significant cash but has been in rapid decline as viewers migrate to streaming. Versant is also particularly interesting as a proxy for Discovery Global, another new linear television company Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to cut loose in the third quarter of 2026 as it sells its Warner Bros. studios and streaming assets to Netflix. David Ellison’s Paramount is attempting to derail that deal, announced late last year, and acquire all of WBD.\n\nA takeover battle between the two bidders has largely come down to Discovery Global, which Par values at about $1 a share but WBD and some Wall Streeters say is worth significantly more.\n\nShare price is a function of multiples of projected future revenue and other metrics based on financials, which, for Discovery Global, have not yet been nailed down, including the precise amount of debt that will be layered on the new company.\n\nMeanwhile, Versant has settled on its new digs and unveiled in late December that it is making the historic New York Times building its permanent home.

Carter) and “Wicked: For Good” (last year’s winner Paul Tazewell) look like the safest bets, joined by “Hamnet” (Malgosia Turzanska, who also has “Train Dreams”), which continues to climb the charts as its overall profile strengthens.

Some from gothic re-imaginings and mythic world-building while others have meticulously rendered period detail, which is the kind of work costume designers have historically rallied behind.\n\nWith the BAFTA longlist set to be unveiled on Jan. 9 (which will include 10 titles), the assumption is that at least four of those titles will hold firm. That likely leaves only one or two nomination slots in play, setting up a familiar awards-season dilemma: legacy versus global sensibility. A legend like Colleen Atwood remains a presence, particularly with two high-profile contenders in “One Battle After Another” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” either of which could benefit from name recognition and career-long goodwill. On the international front, “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale,” with costumes by Anna Mary Scott Robbins, represents the kind of refined, period-authentic craftsmanship BAFTA voters often embrace, while Consolata Boyle’s work on the period drama “Blue Moon” could appeal to Academy voters looking to honor classical elegance executed at the highest level.\n\nIn other news, the 28th Costume Designers Guild Awards added another data point to the conversation. Titles such as “One Battle After Another,” “Weapons,” “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and “Bugonia” all landed noms. Notably absent, however, was “The Testament of Ann Lee,” a reminder that CDG recognition, while influential, is not a prerequisite for Oscar success. The Academy has a long history of singling out a film that failed to register with the guild or didn’t get seen in time.\n\nNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\nSee all Academy Award predictions below:\n\nVariety Awards Circuit: Oscars", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 22:03:08 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T22:27:22.332528"}

As the phase one period for Oscar nominations enters its final, volatile stretch, a few unexpected titles are beginning to press against what once looked like a locked best picture lineup.\n\nRichard Linklater’s “Blue Moon” from Sony Pictures Classics continues to build serious word of mouth and is quietly building a deep bench of admirers behind the scenes. To the point that a surprise best picture nomination no longer feels far-fetched. The film’s quiet momentum — the kind that grows through admiration rather than spectacle — is exactly how late-breaking contenders have slipped into the lineup in the past.\n\nJoseph Kosinski’s “F1,” fresh off two major wins at the Critics Choice Awards, is also testing the edges of the race. There is almost always room for what might be called a “normal people” movie — accessible, star-driven and emotionally legible — in the best picture field. Think “The Blind Side” or “Top Gun: Maverick.” The Apple studios high-octane racing drama starring Brad Pitt fits that mold, but its viability likely hinges on securing a nomination from the Producers Guild of America, which announces Friday.\n\nHow many international feature films will be in best picture remains another open question, particularly among Neon’s contenders. Joachim Trier’s Norwegian drama “Sentimental Value” feels solidly positioned, but whether the Academy embraces more than one non-English-language film is still unclear. Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Brazilian thriller and Critics Choice winner “The Secret Agent,” alongside Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident,” are both in play, though space feels very limited.\n\nElsewhere, Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” is gathering momentum across categories. Jacob Elordi’s surprise Critics Choice win for supporting actor as the Creature has helped reposition the film as more than a technical showcase, giving it renewed credibility in the above-the-line conversations.\n\nOver the weekend, the Palm Springs International Film Awards gala delivered its annual blend of star power. Next on the awards docket are SAG noms on Wednesday, Golden Globes Awards arriving Sunday night and Oscar nomination voting opening Monday morning.\n\nAt the Critics Choice Awards, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” swept best picture, director and adapted screenplay. The acting winners included Timothee Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”), Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), Elordi and Amy Madigan (“Weapons”). Whether or not they can all translate remains to be seen.\n\nStill, the race is far from unsettled. Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” which co-led all films with four wins at CCA, could be a late-breaking spoiler, if the coalition remains intact.\n\nThis week’s updated predictions are below.\n\nTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films):\n\nTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios):\n\nSee all Academy Award predictions\n\nVariety Awards Circuit: Oscars\n\n\n\n\n\n*** = PREDICTED WINNER\n\n(All predicted nominees listed below are in alphabetical order)", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 22:40:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T22:49:06.288956"}

Delivered.\n\nDeadline first told you in November that John Mayer and McG were closing in on buying the famed Jim Henson Studio lot and the Charlie Chaplin Studios at 1416 N. La Brea in Los Angeles. Now comes word that the deal is done.\n\nThe duo announced today that the historic property will continue “operating as a major working studio in the heart of Los Angeles.”\n\nThe seven-time Grammy winner and Charlie’s Angels director announced the facility, where Mayer records and has offices, is open for business.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“Now renamed Chaplin Studios, the property will continue to operate as a fully staffed, fully functioning production and recording facility — open immediately and actively booking projects across music, film, television, and digital media.”\n\nDespite owning The Muppets IP, Disney didn’t own the Jim Henson lot. The Henson family did. There was buzz that the Church of Scientology was circling to buy the property in early October, but Deadline learned and reported that that wasn’t true.\n\nA spokesperson for the Jim Henson family said then: “In regards to recent rumors about the sale of the La Brea studio lot, the Henson family is not in any business dealings with the Church of Scientology, and that organization is not in consideration as a potential buyer of the property. It is still the family’s intention to move The Jim Henson Company to a new location it can share with Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, but at this time the family is not in escrow with any buyer.”\n\nThe 80,000-square-foot facility included recording studios and, at the time of the Henson family purchase in 2000, it contained Chaplin’s 10,000-square-foot sound stage and original woodworking shop.\n\nThe Jim Henson Company put the lot on the sale block in an effort to put the production company and its Burbank-based Jim Henson’s Creature Shop in one facility, which the space at La Brea could not accommodate. Chaplin shot cinema classics such as The Kid, The Gold Rush, Modern Times and The Great Dictator at the studio.\n\n“This studio has stood at the center of Hollywood’s history for generations, and it’s a privilege to help shepherd it into its next chapter,” said Mayer. “Beyond its film legacy, the musical history here is extraordinary — from the A&M years and being home to A&M Records to landmark albums recorded on this campus to ‘We Are the World’ being captured inside Studio A. The Chaplin lot has given the world some of its most enduring art, and our goal is to honor that legacy by keeping it working, open, and accessible to the creative community.”\n\n\n\nMcG added, “You can feel the spirit of Hollywood’s past the moment you set foot on this lot. From Chaplin to Superman, to Soul Train, this place is a cornerstone of our industry’s history. John and I are committed to respecting that heritage while ensuring the studios remain a vibrant, fully operational home for filmmakers, musicians, and creators. We want artists to walk through these gates and immediately feel that spark of possibility.”\n\nIn 1952, Chaplin sold the property to real estate development firm Webb and Knapp, who ultimately rented to feature productions like George Reeves’ Adventures of Superman. Red Skelton purchased the lot in 1960, and it was owned by CBS from 1962-1966. By1966, it was in the hands of Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss’ A&M Records. Most recently, the lot served as headquarters for The Jim Henson Company.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:26:11 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T23:26:58.249431"}

The Season 2 trailer can be found below.\n\nAcross six episodes, the docuseries will focus on an exclusive interview with Black Mafia Family co-founder Terry Lee “Southwest Tee” Flenory, highlighting his role as the mastermind, his deep bond with Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory, and the ultimate breakdown of their relationship as power, paranoia, and law enforcement pressure drove them apart.\n\nThe docuseries overall explores the rise and fall of the Black Mafia Family, the notorious drug empire built by brothers Demetrius and Terry Flenory. Fueled by ambition, loyalty, and a shared vision, they created a sprawling criminal enterprise, only to be undone by rivalries, betrayal, and the weight of their choices. From the streets of Detroit to the heights of infamy, this is their untold story and the lasting legacy they left behind.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDemetrius Flenory Jr. as Big Meech (his real-life father) and Da’Vinchi as Terry Flenory in BMF’s fourth season STARZ\n\nThe BMF Documentary: Blowing Money Fast was ordered in 2021 as a companion project to complement the Starz scripted crime drama BMF, which recently concluded its four-season run on Starz. The show was cancelled on October 29, leaving fans with a cliffhanger when Big Meech (Demetrius Flenory Jr.) was arrested by Detective Von Bryant (Steve Harris).\n\nHowever, considering the series followed the adventures of the Flenory Brothers, with Da’Vinchi starring opposite Flenory Jr. as Terry Flenory, viewers can read up on the events that followed. They can also now catch the docuseries’ second season, where they can hear details straight from the real-life Southwest Tee.\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation regarding why the show was cancelled, with a spotlight on franchise executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson’s beef with Big Meech. Sources at the time of cancellation told Deadline that Jackson and Big Meech’s frayed relationship was not the reason BMF ended. Jackson addressed the rumors during a recent chat with Deadline, while promoting his ratings juggernaut Netflix docuseries Sean Combs: The Reckoning.\n\n“BMF was already slightly declining [in ratings] before the last season started, and they made some creative choices that were, from my perspective, not good choices. I know people feel like I turned it off, but the networks would have continued to move forward with the show if it was doing the numbers it had been doing. So it’s [one thing] me saying that the show’s over, and then [another] that it’s actually over. Those were the circumstances; it wasn’t me,” Jackson told me in late November.\n\nWith that clarification, whether The BMF Documentary: Blowing Money Fast will continue beyond Season 2 is as yet unknown. Regarding the future of the franchise, Jackson has reiterated his intentions to continue via spinoffs, both before BMF was cancelled and after. However, he has yet to elaborate on what storylines or timelines he’s interested in expanding on.\n\nJackson is also executive producer of the “Power” franchise on Starz, which has successfully found new life beyond the mothership series Power with spinoffs Ghost, Raising Kanan, Force, and the new prequel project Origins. Ghost concluded its run after four seasons in 2024, prequel Raising Kanan will end following its upcoming fifth season, and Force will wrap up Tommy’s (Joseph Sikora) Chicago adventures after three seasons on January 16. Origins is currently in production on its freshman season in New York/New Jersey.\n\nAll that to say that BMF‘s ending after four seasons doesn’t signify that the Black Family Mafia’s stories can’t continue.\n\nIn addition to Jackson, The BMF Documentary: Blowing Money Fast is also executive produced by Shan Nicholson (Jerusalem: City of Faith and Fury, Rubble Kings), who will also serve as the series’s showrunner, as well as Razan Ghalayini, Richard Perello, and Stacey Offman. Khidija Rivera and Jessica Vale co-executive produce, and the supervising producer is Kenyatta Steans.

From 1981 through 2013, every best picture winner was also nominated for film editing, a remarkable 33-year streak that helped cement the category as one of the Academy’s most reliable predictors. Roughly two-thirds of best picture winners have gone on to win the editing Oscar.\n\nThat pattern has cracked only twice in the expanded best picture era. “Birdman” (2014) and “CODA” (2021) both won best picture without editing nominations.\n\nThis year’s editing race showcases radically different philosophies of cinematic rhythm.\n\n“Hamnet” and “Marty Supreme” represent one of the season’s most intriguing case studies, particularly because of the filmmakers’ hands-on approach. Josh Safdie and Chloé Zhao co-editing their own films places them in exceedingly rare company. Only three directors have ever won the Oscar for film editing — James Cameron for “Titanic,” Alfonso Cuarón for “Gravity” and Sean Baker for “Anora.” Others, including David Lean, the Coen brothers (working under the alias Roderick Jaynes) and Zhao herself, have previously earned editing nominations for films they directed.\n\nAnother crucial factor shaping the race is the long-standing bond between film editing and sound. Since 2013, no two Oscar categories have demonstrated a stronger statistical relationship, regardless of whether sound was split into editing and mixing or combined into a single award. During the split-sound era, films such as “Gravity,” “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Dunkirk” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” swept both editing and sound. Even when the overlap was partial, the connection held. “Hacksaw Ridge” won editing and sound mixing in 2016, while “Ford v Ferrari” took editing and sound editing in 2019.\n\nThat relationship has loosened in recent years. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) won editing without a sound nom. “Oppenheimer” (2023) claimed editing but lost sound to “The Zone of Interest.” Last year, “Anora” won editing without a sound nod, while “Dune: Part Two” took home the statue.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, “F1” vrooms into the conversation as a potential disruptor. Fresh off a Critics Choice Award win for editing and powered by its commercial success and broad appeal, the high-octane racing drama has been registering beyond the craft branches. If its momentum carries through the guild phase, “F1” could position itself as a film testing the edges of a best picture nom as well.\n\nNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\nSee all Academy Award predictions below:\n\nVariety Awards Circuit: Oscars", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:42:22 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T23:45:18.161959"}

After you see what you created, you can’t unsee that stuff,” Arkapaw said.\n\nEmotions were key to “Wicked” and its conclusion, “Wicked: For Good.” “The first movie would live in this effervescent daylight and the second film would be steeped in maturity and density and have a weight to it,” Brooks says. “As we were designing it, ‘Wicked: For Good’ has this handmade feel to it, but it also feels textured and raw and edgy.”\n\nBrooks used every color of the rainbow to light the movie. Each scene, color meant something. “Red is when you make the wrong choice. You see that in a lot in the governor’s mansion. Orange is the color of Elphaba’s transformation, and you see it with the flames and with ‘No Dood Deed.'” And blue, Brooks says is the color of love between the two.

Now called the Actor Awards, nominations will be announced Jan. 7. With more than 122,000 SAG-AFTRA performers eligible to vote — the largest voting body of any major awards show — the results often reflect populist tastes and broad mainstream appeal.\n\nThis year’s eligibility window covers performances released between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2025, setting up what appears to be a competitive field across all categories.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSince the ensemble category was introduced in 1995, only four films — “Braveheart” (1995), “The Shape of Water” (2017), “Green Book” (2018) and “Nomadland” (2020) — have gone on to win best picture at the Academy Awards without earning a SAG ensemble nomination. Since the Academy expanded the best picture field in 2009, 61 of the 80 films nominated for SAG ensemble — a 76% success rate — have also received best picture nominations, underscoring the category’s value as a reliable Oscar indicator.\n\nThe ensemble race is as crowded as ever.\n\nWarner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” is entering as an early frontrunner with a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn, and a lineup that fits the guild’s well-established preference for recognizable names. There’s also some history to possibly be made. At a projected seven nominations, Paul Thomas Anderson’s action epic is poised to become the most nominated movie in the history of SAG. And there’s still room for one more in case Regina Hall makes the cut in supporting actress alongside Teyana Taylor.\n\nThe list of the most nominated films in SAG history is currently a six-way tie with five each: “Shakespeare in Love” (1998), “Chicago” (2002), “Doubt” (2008), “The Banshees of Inisherin” (2022), “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) and “Wicked” (2024). Of those, “Shakespeare,” “Chicago” and “Everything Everywhere” went on to win the SAG Award for best cast ensemble before clinching the Academy Award for best picture. “Doubt” took home best actress at SAG for Meryl Streep (but lost the Oscar) while “Banshees” and “Wicked” both went home empty-handed.\n\nObviously, SAG’s predictive strength extends to the film acting races as well. Since 2009, SAG’s film acting nominees have overlapped with the Academy Awards an average of 16 out of 20 slots, an 80% match rate. The strongest alignment came in 2009, the year of “The Hurt Locker,” when 19 of 20 SAG nominees went on to earn Oscar nominations. The weakest crossover occurred in 2021, the year of “CODA,” when the overlap dropped to 12 of 20.\n\nLast year’s best actor winner, Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), continues his momentum and is back with his turn as table tennis prodigy Marty Mauser in Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme.” Notably, no film actor has ever won back-to-back SAG Awards. That could open the door for someone else to take the top spot. Nonetheless, DiCaprio, Michael B. Jordan and Ethan Hawke are all expected to hear their names called. The organization has not been kind to non-English language performances, which is why a snub is projected for “The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura. Despite emphatic praise from critics, the guild’s longstanding hesitation to nominate non-English language performances — see Sandra Hüller’s omission for “Anatomy of a Fall” — remains a barrier.\n\nStill, there is some expected recognition for non-English storytelling with Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas all predicted to make their respective lineups for the Norwegian family drama “Sentimental Value.”\n\nActors who are mainstays at the ceremony such as Glenn Close (who has 10 individual nominations and could appear for “Wake Up Dead Man”) or William H. Macy, who could find his way to a nomination for his work in “Train Dreams,” which is predicted to land in the cast ensemble category.\n\nOn the television side, the drama series race will likely be dominated by streaming platforms, with Apple TV’s “Severance” and HBO Max’s “The White Lotus” expected to lead the pack alongside Netflix’s final season of “Stranger Things.” In comedy, FX’s “The Bear” and HBO’s “Hacks” remain fixtures, while Apple TV could break through with Seth Rogen’s “The Studio.”\n\nSome of the other individual acting categories showcase a mix of established favorites and veterans — Jean Smart, Jeremy Allen White, Adam Scott — and relative newcomers like Glen Powell for “Chad Powers.”\n\nThe limited series categories are heavily weighted toward Netflix, which could claim as many as eight of the 10 nomination slots across both male and female actor categories, led by their Emmy-winning miniseries “Adolescence.”\n\nNominations will be announced Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Final voting to determine the winners will take place from Jan. 14 through Feb. 27 at noon Pacific time. The 32nd annual Actor Awards, presented by SAG-AFTRA, will air live on Netflix on March 1.\n\nThe final predictions in all film and TV categories are below.\n\nSee all Academy Award predictions\n\nVariety Awards Circuit: Oscars\n\n\n\n\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nFilm Categories\n\nCast Ensemble in a Motion Picture\n\n“ Hamnet ” (Focus Features)\n\n” (Focus Features) “ Marty Supreme ” (A24)\n\n” (A24) “ One Battle After Another ” (Warner Bros.)\n\n” (Warner Bros.) “ Sinners ” (Warner Bros.)\n\n” (Warner Bros.) “Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\nAlternates: “Sentimental Value” and “Wicked: For Good”\n\nMale Actor in a Leading Role\n\nTimothée Chalamet , “Marty Supreme” (A24)\n\n, “Marty Supreme” (A24) Leonardo DiCaprio , “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n\n, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)

He was 91.\n\nPederson was a fixture in the field of science fiction filmmaking, particularly thanks to his involvement on Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” in 1968. Alongside three other special effects supervisors including Douglas Trumbull, Wally Veevers and Tom Howard, Pederson’s work led the director to his Oscar win for best visual effects in 1969. On set, Pederson ran the “war room,” where the VFX shots were planned, scheduled, tracked and evaluated. For each shot, anywhere from eight to ten elements were added to the original camera negative, an intricate process that took months.\n\nIn Michael Benson’s 2018 book “Space Odyssey,” the author quotes Trumbull as saying, “The film’s post-production process was epic in its complexity and Con was the smartest guy in the room.” He added that “‘2001’ absolutely would not have happened without Con.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAfter working on the film, Pederson went on to co-found pioneering computer animation company Robert Abel and Associates, where he worked as an animator and programmer alongside Bob Abel. Following the company’s closing, he continued as a creative lead at Metrolight Studios alongside Tim McGovern.\n\n“Con was a constant source of wisdom and knowledge,” said John Nelson, who met Pederson during his time at Robert Abel and Associates. “He was a Renaissance man who was both an artist and a technician. He could animate by hand or write computer programs to generate animations. Several people from Robert Abel’s went on to win Oscars for Visual Effects. I was lucky enough to be one of them.”\n\nBefore Pederson began his career in the film industry, he attended UCLA, where he majored in art and anthropology. During his time there, Pederson was hired at Disney after making student films. He was then drafted into the U.S. Army, where he worked with Wernher von Braun on rocket projects. Pederson went on to work at Graphic Films following his time, where he wrote and directed the 1964 film “To The Moon And Beyond” for the world’s fair. Kubrick saw the film, and thus hired Pederson to work on “2001: A Space Odyssey.”\n\nOutside of work, he created crossword puzzles that were published across the New York Times, the Wall St. Journal and the Washington Post, and loved science fiction, hiking, sailing and collecting and building things with bricks he had collected from all over the country.\n\nPederson is survived by his wife Carole and his son Eric, stepchildren Tracey and Morgan and grandchildren Alex and Vivi.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:44:54 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T02:23:44.478531"}

On his hurriedly moved-up debut Saturday night, before his official start date, the anchor covered the U.S. capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro almost exclusively through a lengthy but unchallenging interview of U.S. defense secretary Pete Hegseth, one in which the administration’s perspective was aired so thoroughly as to raise the question of when an interview becomes a press release. (In this aspect, Dokoupil’s work certainly suited the Weiss doctrine: The news chief’s first big scandal on the job arose right before Christmas when she held a “60 Minutes” segment over its not sufficiently representing the side of the administration, who had declined comment in the first place. For Weiss, it may not be news if the nation’s current leadership doesn’t get an unchallenged say.)\n\nAnd in his official first broadcast on Jan. 5, Dokoupil betrayed a Weissian willingness to bulldoze past that which might seem too untidy for whatever hypothetical viewer he and his editor have in mind. Dokoupil blandly stated to the camera that a Russian-Chinese-Iranian base of influence in Venezuela will be destabilized by the U.S. military action, without citing any source or consulting any guest; a brief interview with a financial expert about how the events in South America will affect the price of gasoline never broached the notion of whether the U.S. extracting Venezuelan petroleum is legal. Perhaps that might have constituted consulting advocates, and not the average American. But it would have been part of telling the whole story.\n\nNot that that seems to be Dokoupil’s strong suit, or his interest. Elsewhere, in a segment about health and human services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s newly announced and seismic shifts to the recommended vaccine schedule for children, Dokoupil began an interview with a CBS News medical journalist by asking what this expert would say to “parents out there who are celebrating,” because they thought their kids were obliged to be injected with too many vaccines. He ended the segment by declaring “So, parents are going to have some options for themselves!” when, to a large portion of the audience, the precise opposite is true — they’ll now need a physician consult to obtain a vaccine for their child that was once more easily obtained. Dokoupil thanked his guest and announced, brashly, “You clarified it for us.” The guest could be said to have tried his best, despite Dokoupil.\n\nWeiss has been reported to have pursued Fox’s Bret Baier and CNN’s Anderson Cooper for this role, but after both stars wisely chose to keep their sinecures, she likely had to choose from among the army she had — but Dokoupil lacks the charisma and aptitude to turn the “Evening News” into whatever it is she may want. He babbled confusedly, then fell silent, when a segment about Sen. Mark Kelly jumped ahead of a segment about Gov. Tim Walz in the lineup — the kind of shift an anchor is supposed to be able to handle without painfully long seconds of dead air. “First day, big problems here,” Dokoupil said with evident frustration.\n\nAnd an newscast-ending segment about a small town in Oregon raising funds by selling a nude calendar of senior citizens felt neither like the news (the movie “Calendar Girls,” about a similar real-life case in the U.K., is more than 20 years old) nor conveyed with wit, elan — or even access. Weiss’ journalism, through her career, has many things that distinguish it, but it fundamentally lacks sensibility. Why was just broadcasting a bunch of nude photos of senior citizens a story? So that Dokoupil could giggle through it.\n\nThankfully, just like parents, viewers have some options for themselves — and few, it seems likely, will choose this reboot. The hypothetical viewer who wishes their news were pitched at a more conservative tenor is super-served by Fox News and Newsmax; evening newscast viewership has been dropping across the board, and, in terms of comfort in the chair and ability to convey thought, Dokoupil has a way to go and will likely move in the wrong direction. Say this much, though: Weiss’ management of “60 Minutes” has so far been a tragedy, in that it is shattering the credibility and prestige of what remains to this day one of the signature, and most popular, programs of any type in American television. The “Evening News” has been ebbing into irrelevance for years for reasons entirely beyond political slant. Perhaps sequestering Dokoupil there might contain the damage that might be done by an anchor whose ambitious ability to see which way the wind blows has so far outstripped his broadcasting talent.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:39:38 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T02:23:44.759061"}

At 45, he is the youngest of the three broadcast news anchors, a once superstar assignment that long ago lost its voice-of-God influence. With his heavy emphasis on social media in recent days, Dokoupil seems determined to break through to new audiences, but some of his remarks have also drawn criticisms and questions about the new direction of CBS News under editor in chief Bari Weiss.\n\nEven though the influence of evening news anchors isn’t what it once was, the selection of Dokoupil, who has been co-host of CBS Mornings, makes him the face of the division, anchoring not just the evening broadcast but special reports and special events.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWith the Venezuelan invasion on Saturday morning, Dokoupil anchored CBS Evening News that evening, so this wasn’t his first stint as permanent anchor. But it did give a feel for the direction that the network is going.\n\nThe opener on Monday started with headline previews of stories to come, a device that has worked well for the ratings leader, ABC’s World News Tonight with David Muir, but was sidelined when CBS relaunched its evening newscast a year ago under John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois. That led to even lower ratings, making another change a priority for the new leadership.\n\nWearing a dark suit and tie, and on a newsroom set, Dokoupil went to six different stories on the U.S. operation to seize Venezuela’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife.\n\nThe first segment featured Matt Gutman, recently hired away from ABC, on Maduro’s arraignment in Manhattan. The second segment, from senior White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe, pointed out the conflicting statements from Donald Trump and his administration on just who was in charge of the country. Other segments spotlighted the new interim president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez, and opposition leader María Corina Machado, as well as interviews with Venezuelans in the U.S. and how they felt about the U.S. operation.\n\nThe Venezuela coverage finished with a segment featuring business analyst Jill Schlesinger, talking about what the U.S. invasion of the oil-rich nation could mean for how much Americans pay at the pump, noting that it will take billions in investments from U.S. companies.\n\nLeft unmentioned was whether such a seizure of another country’s natural resources means to U.S. foreign policy, whether the Trump administration has done much planning, or if it is even legal. Rather, it was treated as a business story.\n\n“I really think we got to set out sights to the long term, meaning not days, not months, but years really,” Schlesinger told Dokoupil.\n\nAfter she made the point that “the global economy will dominate, as it always does,” Dokoupil ended her segment by telling her “You dominate. Appreciate it.”\n\nDokoupil’s more casual language seems to be part of a plan to try to make the newscast more accessible, something that he has outlined in a series of social media posts in recent days. In one video, he told viewers that “on too many stories the press has missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you.”\n\nThat said, the CBS Evening News with Tony Dokoupil so far has relied quite a bit on the perspective of advocates, as is understandable with a major breaking story, and it’s unclear just what relying on the “average American” will look like.\n\nGiven the little time there is in a 30-minute broadcast, Dokoupil’s social media comments may be nothing much more than a marketing effort.\n\nBut they are undoubtedly viewed with an extra level of scrutiny not because of the new anchor, but because of the way that Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount went down last year.\n\nAs it sought approval for the transaction, the old Paramount owners settled a Trump lawsuit against CBS News, even though its lawyers had previously deemed it baseless. Then, as it sought the FCC greenlight, Skydance agreed to hire an ombudsman to take complaints about the network’s news coverage. The person selected, Kenneth Weinstein, is the former head of a rightward Washington think tank, the Hudson Institute.\n\nThen, last month, Weiss pulled a 60 Minutes segment on Trump administration deportations, even though it was already finished and promoted to be broadcast. Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi protested that the decision was political; Weiss said that the segment was “not ready” and needed more principals, or Trump administration officials.\n\nAll of the incidents have put the focus on Weiss’ each and every move in the news division, and whether it is somehow softening toward Trump at a time when Paramount may need his administration’s approval if it succeeds in its hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe concerns of corporate interference were great enough that Dokoupil, in his social media remarks last week, also pledged to viewers that “you come first. Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And, yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS. I report for you.”\n\nWhat’s unclear is how far Dokoupil will go in another declaration he made on social media. In response to one commentator lamenting the news division since the era of Walter Cronkite. Dokoupil wrote, “I can promise you we’ll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or any one else of his era.” The network has not said whether complaints that the ombudsman receives about the Evening News will be made public.\n\nIn his first official stint, Dokoupil was up front about what was going on during a glitch in the broadcast. As he appeared to be ready to go to a story about Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, an image of Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) appeared on the screen. “First day, first day. Big problems here,” Dokoupil said, shaking his head. Glitches do happen — or, to out it in perspective, just another day in America.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:45:45 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T02:23:45.149286"}

The image captures Mellisa moving through festive surroundings with focused determination, presenting a figure who maintains sharp composure amid surrounding chaos.\n\nVasanth made her Kannada-language film debut with “Birbal Trilogy” in 2019.

The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time.

She doesn’t just perform, she processes. She asks questions, not out of doubt but out of curiosity. It pushes me to think deeper and sometimes even my own choices as a director,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “Watching her work reminds me that intelligence on screen often lies in what is left unsaid. Between shots, I often see her quietly writing in her journal, capturing thoughts, small anecdotes from the set. Those moments say a lot about her process. She is constantly building her own inner world. I find her approach incredibly thoughtful, and at times I honestly wish I could steal those pages and read through them, just to understand the mind behind such a layered performance.”\n\nThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P.

YouTube, ByteDance’s Douyin and TikTok, and Netflix lead the field, alongside strong national champions including JioHotstar and U-Next.\n\nJapan and India emerge as the two largest contributors to incremental video and streaming revenue growth outside China, though through different dynamics. Japanese growth is driven by higher average revenue per user, supported by premium-priced tiers, local content and sports differentiation. India’s growth remains more volume-led but is increasingly supported by monetization upgrades, advertising-supported offerings, ARPU increases projected after 2026 and expanding CTV usage.\n\nPremium AVOD revenues are projected to grow from $8 billion in 2025 to over $12 billion by 2030, led by India, Japan and Australia, followed by South Korea and Indonesia. Platforms across the region are raising prices, introducing higher-tier products and bundling premium sports and local content.\n\nUser-generated and social video platforms remain the major beneficiaries of online video advertising growth. Outside China, YouTube, Meta and ByteDance’s TikTok account for the majority of incremental spend. In China, Douyin, Kuaishou and Tencent lead the market. Short-form platforms are also evolving toward episodic consumption, with micro-dramas emerging as a measurable revenue category in China and expected to gain relevance in India, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand.\n\nAI-enabled tools are being deployed across content development, localization, post-production and marketing, reducing unit costs and accelerating production timelines. MPA notes this dynamic will reinforce scale advantages and favor platforms with large libraries and diversified monetization strategies.\n\n“Value is shifting decisively toward streaming, social platforms and CTV-led monetisation,” said Vivek Couto, CEO and executive director of Media Partners Asia. “Markets with scale, pricing power and strong local content ecosystems will continue to outperform, while traditional television economics face long-term structural erosion. What differentiates winners in this cycle is not volume alone, but the ability to monetise premium experiences, anchored by sports, high-quality local programming, emerging formats such as micro-dramas, and increasingly by AI-enabled efficiency across the content value chain.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 06:39:42 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T06:49:58.114715"}

Only the question this time will be: What state is Sam in and can he save the day again?\n\nSpeaking to Deadline in London late last year, the star and executive producer of the Apple TV thriller series talked through the mind state of Nelson, a talented business negotiator and ordinary working man who becomes an unlikely hero after a plane hijacking in Season 1.\n\nAs Season 2 gets underway, commuters on an underground train are taken hostage, and authorities scramble to save hundreds of lives. Nelson is at the heart of the crisis on board, as the authorities in Germany and the UK scramble to avert disaster. The likes of Toby Jones, Christian Näthe and Christiane Paul join the cast, with Christine Adams, Max Beesley and Archie Panjabi among the returners.\n\n“We really thought about what we answered in Season 1 and the questions that were unanswered,” said Elba. “What happened to Sam? Is he alright? He saved a lot of lives and went through a lot of trauma.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“Psychologically, I was trying to put him in a very different place. Physically, there is a difference to the way he looks from Season 1 and that was intentional. When you find out what is going on through the season, you realize this is a broken man who is trying to find those answers.”\n\nIdris Elba discusses his 'Hijack' character Sam Nelson's psychological transformation in season 2 and whether or not he's an anti-hero: \"This is a broken man who's trying to find those answers\" pic.twitter.com/7YXycN54Wc — Deadline (@DEADLINE) January 6, 2026\n\nIt’s fair to say Nelson is a different type of lead character than others Elba is known for, such as Detective John Luther from BBC and Netflix crime franchise Luther or Stringer Bell in HBO drama The Wire.\n\n“Leading characters often have a lot of real estate to hold up,” he said of the role, which landed him an Emmy nomination first time around. “I’m lucky I’ve had these really big characters that audiences don’t mind watching for a long time. In this case, it’s very different from some other characters: He’s a broken guy.”\n\nJim Field Smith, the show’s lead director and co-creator alongside George Kay, also offered a view into Nelson’s mindset as the series begins.\n\n“Our whole guiding principle with Sam was that I wanted him to start Season 2 as a completely different character from the Sam Nelson you’ve left behind,” he said. “In the very first frame when the camera resolves on him this season, you’re supposed to think, ‘What the hell’s happened to this guy?’”\n\nField Smith and Elba both act as exec producers for Hijack Season 2 alongside Kay, Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta and Tom Nash. 60Forty Films and Idiotlamp Productions are co-producing. They both talked about the extreme measures the production design team went to in recreating the U-Bahn in east London, UK.\n\n“I wanted it be a perfect replica,” said Field Smith. “It couldn’t be conveniently slightly easier to film in, and that’s partly because I knew I wanted to film with the real deal in Berlin. It had to match. It had to be literally a millimetre perfect recreation, so that was a big challenge.”\n\nElba called building the train to scale a “massive” feat that allowed for a more dynamic filming environment than the relatively static situation of a hijacked plane. “There were a lot of people on the train,” he added. “There’s a lot of movement in and out trains, doorways, [and] movement along. There’s a lot going on.”\n\n'Hijack' star Idris Elba on the production of season 2 of the show, shooting in Dagenham and Berlin, and the difference between the story being set on a train versus the plane in season 1 pic.twitter.com/NNkQFBj7dF — Deadline (@DEADLINE) January 6, 2026\n\nField Smith said the production gave Elba “essentially free reign of the entire environment,” and allowed the direction to follow him through the various sociological make-ups of the different carriages. Furthermore, shooting underground allowed the story to explore how a major metropolitan city such as Berlin would respond to a hostage situation, especially one with an international element and British authorities also involved.\n\n“It’s such a rich area that we would have been crazy not to lean into that a little bit,” added Field Smith, a British director with credits for The Wrong Mans, Criminal and Litvinenko who grew up in Berlin.\n\nHe was keen to point to the international nature of the show. “One of the great things about Season 1 is we had such a great global response,” he said. “It had an international aspect in that it had a plane take off from Dubai and was flying over all of these countries, and you’ve got their responses and how the UK government is managing that. In Season 2 the train is staying in one city, and really you have to bring the internationality to the show. There is an appetite for audiences to see stories that play out in multiple countries. What’s great about [Hijack] is it has that multilayered aspect to it.”\n\nApple TV relationship\n\nHijack Season 1 was developed and produced out of Elba’s first-look deal with Apple through his previous production house, Green Door. The deal ended in 2023, but Season 2 kept the two in business. We asked him on his views on such deals after his experience.\n\n“There are really good, healthy example of putting together a commitment of creator and studio,” he said. “In this instance, that contract produced something really healthy. I hope they feel happy about it. I did, for sure.\n\n“I don’t think it works for everything; In this day and age, creation can take many forms. I really enjoyed working with – and still work with – Apple, and enjoy that process. In a healthy deal, [a first-look agreement] is a really great space to be. I felt really lucky to have a guaranteed distribution opportunity and some support for making it.”\n\nIdris Elba discusses working with streamers and studios, and his partnership with Apple TV for 'Hijack': “I don’t think it works for everything. In this day and age, creation can take many forms. I really enjoyed working with – and still work with – Apple, and enjoy that process.… pic.twitter.com/eb5u5hngS5 — Deadline (@DEADLINE) January 6, 2026\n\nFollowing Hijack‘s launch on January 14, one episode will drop a week until March 4, when Sam’s fate – and those of the hostages – will be revealed. Whether that will be it for the character awaits to be seen. Elba and Field Smith suggest it will be the end, but they’re leaving the door slightly ajar – just in case more civilians need rescuing.\n\n“I don’t know if Sam Nelson is going to get on another method of transport in his life,” joked Field Smith. “Season 3 might just be him in a hotel room chilling.”\n\nElba – who was recently knighted in the UK’s New Year’s Honour’s List – also played down the idea, laughing as he joked that a third run would simply see the psychologically-damaged character on a Lime bike – the pay-and-ride bicycles that litter London’s roads.\n\n“I think we’ve squeezed the juice out of the transporter thing,” he said, before leaving a small carrot dangling. “Who knows, there are ferries,” he quipped. “There is definitely a sense that we like the Sam Nelson character and there is one more iteration of his story that I can think of – for sure. It might be a film, who knows?”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T08:39:16.994908"}

And that’s not me, ok? If I needed money, I wouldn’t ask for no f*cking charity. Whoever did this…I don’t know why they did it. I wouldn’t know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years.”\n\nThe Wrestler actor, who’s had his share of ups and downs, admits, “It is embarrassing, but I’m sure I’ll get over it like everything else.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHe then entreats fans and supporters, “Don’t give any money. And if you gave money, get it back.”\n\nThe GoFundMe page claims, “This fundraiser is being created with Mickey’s full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent that from happening.”\n\nNot so, according to Rourke, who says he’ll take legal action.\n\n“I’m going to talk to my lawyer…and get to the bottom of this.”\n\nThe page’s author is Liya-Joelle Jones, who says in the post that she is the assistant to Kimberly Hines, who has been Mickey Rourke’s manager for the past nine years.\n\nHines tells Deadline that her team did, in fact, create the page in an act of desperation after the actor was served an eviction notice and had nowhere to go.\n\n“We’re trying to do the best that we can,” Hines says.\n\nRourke’s longtime assistant is on vacation, and while his team was first trying to avoid eviction altogether, the actor suddenly needed a new place to stay, movers and a storage shed for his belongings, none of which were in the offing. Hines says she had no idea that he would take umbrage.\n\n“My assistant started it to help Mickey as a nice gesture because he was being forced out of his home,” Hines said. “It was not done with any mal intent. The money has not gone anywhere. If Mickey decides he does not want it, the money will be returned to his fans.”\n\nGoFundMe does offer what seems to be a fairly straightforward way to refund any money that has not been spent, as long as it has not been transferred into the recipient’s bank account.\n\nIn the video Rourke admits, “I’ve done a really terrible job in managing my career.” He calls the whole media scrum “humiliating.” He also admits to needing cash recently.\n\n“I did borrow some money from a really great friend of mine. Eventually, I’ll say who it was. He helped me out of a jam. Covid and the writer’s strike killed my money.”\n\nThings got worse, Rourke says, during a dispute over repairs to the rental.\n\n“I was in a really bad situation with the place I was renting. Everything was good for 5 or 6 years and then two scumbags from New York bought the house and they wouldn’t fix anything. So I said “I’m not paying rent because there’s mice, there’s rats. The floor’s rotten. One bathtub, there’s no water. In two different sinks, there was no water.”\n\nHines notes that there was so much mold and water damage that much of Rourke’s furniture cannot be moved out. Her staff has been in his home trying to clean and salvage what they can and get it into storage.\n\nHines says she and her crew have moved Rourke to a local hotel — with the management team and a very generous producer who’s worked with Rourke in the past footing the bill.\n\nThe bright side, if there is one, is that some offers have come Rourke’s way in the past few days.\n\n“I would love nothing more than Mickey Rourke to go back to work and do what he does best,” Hines told Deadline.\n\nEven if he is confused by the situation, the actor seems to be content with his new surroundings.\n\n“I’m very grateful for what I have. I got a roof over my head. I’ve got food to eat,” he says.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 08:55:06 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T09:02:45.072552"}

The Paris-based AI studio rolled out in 2024 with just one IP, “Fuzzlets” which has quietly become a breakout hit, generating 159 million monthly views across YouTube and amassing 3.1 million followers without a single dollar spent on advertising.\n\nPitched as the “first fully AI-native animation ecosystem for kids and families,” the Paris-based studio was founded by a bunch of millennials with impressive track records: Youmna Chamcham, who previously co-created, starred in and produced “Mini Studio,” one of the MENA region’s longest-running kids TV franchises and built LiveLove, a 17-million-strong digital community; alongside Marcella Ricca, an education and behavioral-science specialist; and Fabrice Nadjari, a former tech adviser to the French presidency and an Emmy-nominated storyteller who worked in Afghanistan.\n\nFrom left to right: Fabrice Nadjari, Marcella Ricca and Youmna Chamcham. (Courtesy of MiniStudio)\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMiniStudio, which is being currently courted by animation powerhouses, had anticipated the emerging collaborations between traditional and AI players, as seen recently with Disney making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI and licensing its intellectual property (including 200 characters) to Sora.\n\n\n\nAlready backed by major tech and media players including PocketWatch’s Chris Williams, a16z Games, Xavier Niel and Mistral AI’s JC Samuelian, MiniStudio is now scaling up, opening its internal AI tools to creators, expanding personalization and developing its first animated feature film.\n\nChamcham says MiniStudio has opened its tools to creators to democratize animation production and unlock a new wave of original IP with fewer structural barriers.\n\n\n\nThe company also points out a six-person team can produce an episode in roughly three weeks – two weeks of storyboarding, one week of animation and post-production — at a cost of about $1,000 per minute, says MiniStudio, which cites “Bluey” as an example of premium preschool animation that typically requires teams of dozens, several months of production and post production, and budgets closer to $16,000 per minute.\n\nNadjari oversaw the development of the studio’s proprietary workflows, while Ricca, who has built education curricula and large-scale experiential projects, shaped the platform’s emotional and pedagogical framework. The idea behind MiniStudio is to deliver content that’s “emotionally intelligent” and helps children unwind and connect, rather than produce fast-paced, algorithm-driven kids content. Set in Joyville, “The Fuzzlets” is an animated series following soulful, mischievous characters as they lead children on journeys learning empathy, bravery and kindness.\n\n“When a child sees themselves inside a story, the psychology changes. It stops being entertainment and becomes recognition,” said Ricca. “They’re not just watching someone else, they’re experiencing what it feels like to be at the centre of the narrative, practicing courage, empathy and creativity. For us, personalization is the architecture of self‑worth,” she continued.\n\nMiniStudio is also launching tools that allow users to create their own cartoons using the same AI workflows that power Fuzzlets. These tools give full creative control over characters, stories and styles.\n\nUsers can personalize Fuzzlets stories and songs, and create musical cards, holiday messages and short-form videos built around positive emotional cues. The company has already tested personalized cartoons and reported many reels becoming viral.\n\n\n\nOn top of positioning itself as an animation banner, MiniStudio is also a technology platform that’s building new templates, new visual styles, expanded toolsets, and a community page where users can share and collaborate on cartoons.\n\n“We make stories with the heart of an animation studio and the flexibility of AI, creating worlds that respond to the child who enters them. We’re not just tech; we’re not just media; we’re something entirely new,” said Nadjari.\n\nMiniStudio is now expanding its Fuzzlets IP into long-form storytelling for its animated feature debut, “Sunhaven and the Sunkeepers.”\n\n\n\nSet in the twilight world of Sunhaven, the film will follow four children pulled from Earth into a realm where joy and color are draining away. Each child embodies an emotional trait – courage, creativity, empathy and wisdom — and must face a deeply personal trial to restore balance. Alongside them are Fuzzy and Purp, two Fuzzlet brothers searching for their lost family. The company is also extending its IP’s beyond screens with a merchandising line including soundbooks and plush toys.\n\nSpeaking of MiniStudio’s longterm vision, Chamcham said the company’s goal is “to build a world where every child can be part of the stories they love. Whether they’re alongside a Fuzzlet or future iconic IP partners, the message is always: you belong.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:55:36 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T09:57:57.947403"}

I wouldn’t know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years,” he continued. “You know, my life is very simple, I don’t go to outside sources like that. And yeah, it is embarrassing, but I’m sure I’ll get over it like anything else.”\n\nThe GoFundMe page, which says it was set up by Liya-Joelle Jones for Kimberly Hines, is almost at its goal of $100,000, having raised over $97,000 so far. The donation page description claims that after Rourke, once a “force of nature” in Hollywood, stepped away from acting to become a professional boxer, he was saddled with “lasting physical and emotional scars” and abandoned by “the industry that once celebrated him.”\n\n“Fame does not protect against hardship, and talent does not guarantee stability,” the description reads. “What remains is a person who deserves dignity, housing, and the chance to regain his footing.”\n\nIn his video message, Rourke encouraged his fans and those who had donated to not “give any money, and if you gave money, get it back.”\n\n“I’m going to talk to my lawyer — I hate talking to him, but I’ve had him forever and I love him.

Rourke opened up a bit about his financial state in the video, saying: “COVID and the writers’ strike killed my money, but I was in a really bad situation with the place I was renting. Everything was good for five or six years, and then two scumbags from New York bought the house and they wouldn’t fix anything … But I would never ask strangers or fans or anybody for a nickel. I mean, that’s not my style. You ask anybody that knows me, it’s humiliating and it’s really fucking embarrassing.”\n\nRourke added that he’s “very grateful for what I have” and assured fans that he has “a roof over my head” and “food to eat.”\n\n“Just get your money back, please,” Rourke concluded. “I don’t need anybody’s money and I wouldn’t do it this way. I got too much pride, man.”\n\nThe highest donation on the GoFundMe page was for $5,000 from an anonymous donor. The second highest was $2,500, followed by $1,500.\n\n“A small gesture to a film legend and modern icon, the strong & great Mickey Rourke,” wrote one donor.\n\nAnother donor penned, “For all the joy and inspiration you gave to mankind (and dogkind, I guess), you deserve to get supported during hard times.

The Overlap was previously financially backed by Miroma Group but the group has now exited its stake following a strategic investment process led by The Overlap.\n\nGoing forwards, the idea is for The Overlap to become a media network spanning brands and channels across different sports, while utilizing Global’s data insights and ad sales.

A fortnight later, George Clarke, an entertainment vlogger with more than 3 million followers, reached the final of another juggernaut, Strictly Come Dancing. The debut season of The Celebrity Traitors, meanwhile, landed Niko Omilana, who made his name creating prank YouTube videos. In what became one of Celebrity Traitors’ most viral moments, he discovered that British screen doyen Stephen Fry was a fan.\n\nThese staple TV shows are watched by families up and down the country, enjoyed by every age demographic and rooted in the mainstream. While the rise and rise of content creators has not gone unnoticed by this publication, a shift has taken place over the past 12 months, and will surely continue into 2026, that has seen creators get more involved behind the camera, as the traditional gatekeepers of British TV think desperately hard about how to remain attractive to younger audiences. Multiple producers tell us top broadcasting executives are now obsessed with content creators and how they can better leverage their talent and audience base.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“It’s no longer just about who holds the mic,” says Glenn Miller, who runs CAA’s creator biz out of the UK, working closely with Weinstein. “It’s about the audience that comes with them. When you look at it that way, you see how seamlessly a creator can fit into a television format. They’re not just hired presenters – they bring meaningful added value.”\n\nThat “added value” was noticeable at late-2025 industry gatherings like the Edinburgh TV Festival and the RTS Cambridge Convention. While in the past, these confabs may have paid lip service to content creators, this time around the stars of YouTube, Instagram and TikTok occupied center stage. The Edinburgh YouTube session was full 30 minutes before it started and the fest’s Alternative MacTaggart lecture was delivered by Munya Chawawa, a multi-hyphenate who broke out doing parody news sketches on YouTube during the pandemic.\n\nJade Beason, a marketing content creator, says she was “inundated” with requests from traditional TV types after speaking on a panel at RTS Cambridge. Since then, she has utilized her dual content creator and marketing experience to consult with broadcasters over how their shows can better use social media from “ideation to launch” and be more targeted at young viewers. She thinks bombshell research that found YouTube is the second most-watched platform in the UK – ahead of the likes of Netflix and ITV – changed the game.\n\n“Data and numbers speak louder than anything else and I personally feel that the past year has seen people in traditional industries wake up to the power of content creators,” says Beason. “The industry is feeling the pinch and it’s harder to fight for people’s attention. The money goes where the attention goes and that attention is on social media and digitial-first channels.”\n\nBeason is becoming something of a go-to in the content creation field and has visited the Prime Minister’s home at 10 Downing Street three times over the past year, along with developing a not-for-profit focused on helping young people from diverse backgrounds into the industry. She says TV gatekeepers are realizing that established TV names and content creators “both speak the same language, but one of us, the content creator, has a heavy accent.” “So it’s all about collaborating so we can understand each other a bit more,” she adds.\n\nA “mutually beneficial relationship”?\n\nMunya Chawawa delivered the Alternative MacTaggart at Edinburgh. Image: Edinburgh Television Festival\n\nChawawa is perhaps the greatest embodiment of how viral talent can work both behind and in front of the camera on traditional TV. He speaks with Deadline while taking a break from a TV project he is producing and several months after his Alternative MacTaggart blasted the British TV industry for “ignoring evolution” as the “same outdated gatekeepers stick to the same outdated guns.”\n\nChawawa works obsessively as a producer. He has spent the past fortnight “painstakingly” researching the best music for his next project using methods inspired by celebrated documentarian Michael Moore.\n\n“[TV and content creators] can be such a mutually beneficial relationship,” Chawawa says, noting that he was behind YouTube’s first ever BAFTA nomination. “For seven years I was jumping on a train from Birmingham pestering people on set, filling my boots for when my shot came. Now you’d be hard pressed for me not to be an exec [on a project]. I want to die on the sword of every show I make.”\n\nBut Chawawa fails to see much of a sea change in terms of a wave of content creators forging the next generation of small screen hits, and he suggests it “feels a little tokenistic” for digital talent to be asked to be consultants on TV shows. “It’s like the traditional folk are saying, ‘Hey young whippersnapper, you understand young people, could you tell us what the 2025 version of [viral dance move] The Dab is?’.”\n\nReflecting on his Alternative MacTaggart four months on, he is downbeat. In his mind, “the people who should have been in that room weren’t there” such as channel executives and the heads of powerhouse production companies. Instead, these execs are “resorting to resurrecting old shows,” he adds. “You’ve got [returning sitcom] Mitchell and Webb, Inbetweeners reboots, Strictly Come Dancing ongoing and various iterations of Bake Off. I enjoy those shows but you don’t want to cling like a limpet to the rock of security. You want to take the risks that caused such excitement to rumble through British television in the first instance.”\n\nOnline is “inevitably going to overtake TV,” Chawawa believes, and he posits how there needs to be a “refresh” of the gatekeepers for younger audiences’ relationship with traditional TV to be rescued from potential “extinction.”\n\nKaio Grizzelle may disagree with this sentiment. The Channel 4 digital commissioning exec is a rare breed, a network commissioner who used to work in the content creation space, having helped launch Gen-Z-focused lifestyle YouTube channel Kyra TV nearly a decade ago.\n\nGrizzelle has been one of the driving forces behind Channel 4.0, the network’s digital-first brand that makes content for social. Channel 4.0 is now three years old and during that time has amassed 2.5 million subscribers and more than one billion views (It took Mr Beast double this amount of time to hit the same milestones, according to Channel 4), handing frequent opportunities to the likes of Catfish UK presenter Nella Rose, Love Island star Chloe Burrows and DiaryRoom, a trio of Muslim women who have made it big on YouTube.\n\n“It helps that I came from the outside as I wasn’t necessarily constrained by traditional thinking,” Grizzelle tells Deadline. “Broadcasters should be looking at these spaces and at talent with these skillsets. We work on what we are commissioning but we exist within the wider [Channel 4] commissioning department, and everything is super collaborative.”\n\nChannel 4.0 is a key pillar of the Gogglebox network’s long-term strategy and ex-CEO Alex Mahon repeatedly sang its praises at industry gatherings. To the next generation of talent, Grizzelle says this really does matter. “We are a young, pioneering team and can champion younger, scrappier, digital first production companies,” he adds.\n\nNot that indies have to be “young and scrappy” to get in on the digital act. Grizzelle’s boss Sacha Khari recently exited to become an SVP at Sony’s new digital studio, Fremantle has just opened a digital and branded content division and BBC Studios has been talking up the virtues of TikTok to anyone who will listen after a hit season of Dancing with the Stars that leveraged the platform in a big way.\n\nEmbracing new models\n\nTwiggy Jalloh, repped by MonRae Management . Image: Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/Getty\n\nKeeping a beady eye on developments has been Bronagh Monahan, who co-runs digital agency MonRae Management and its production arm MonRae Productions, repping talent including gamer DanTDM and Take Time with Twiggy pod host Twiggy Jalloh. Along with the likes of InterTalent, YMU and MVE, MonRae is one of a number of digital agencies competing for talent in London’s bustling scene. Agencies specializing in the area grew their staff bases by 15% in 2024, which was double the number of scripted agencies and quadruple unscripted, according to recent research. It is therefore no wonder that CAA’s Weinstein was in London a few weeks ago, eyeing up agent hirings or possible boutique acquisitions.\n\nFor Monahan, IP is the name of the game. She reveals her agency is working with rights owners on a number of reboots of old formats for YouTube, with more info coming later this year.\n\n“There are formats that have existed over decades and constantly have to be adapted for the time,” she adds. “Viewer expectation is so much higher now so you can see how creative and development people get frustrated [trying to come up with original formats]. You can’t be bound by the old models. You have to form partnerships, share IP and open things up to other revenue streams to survive.”\n\nIn this vein, Monahan says The Sidemen’s Inside, which is effectively a remake of Big Brother for the YouTube generation and was picked up by Netflix, is a solid blueprint. “I hope streamers continue to do this because ultimately streamers are investing more into production than a YouTube show.”\n\nMonahan, who has worked with Amelia Dimoldenberg and BAFTA-winning Things You Should Have Done creator Lucia Keskin, is enthused by how the success of creators like Angry Ginge could lead to new opportunities for her clients. She does, however, have a word of warning for broadcasters seeking the next generation of Angry Ginges to bedeck the small screen.\n\n“Angry Ginge is quick, charismatic and funny and I can see why he has done well in that live environment, but he also has the benefit of huge Twitch numbers that not every other [digital] talent has,” she adds. “I really hope there will be other metrics of talent discovery. In the TV and film world you have ratings but you also have critics and tastemakers saying, ‘I think this stuff is really good and I’m advocating for it.’ Talent who create on the internet don’t always have that benefit.”\n\nMonahan’s focus on reinventing IP for the YouTube generation is a new demand that is being met head on by Nicole Finnan, the former Peaky Blinders exec who now runs a consultancy, Jaeger Media, and was one of the many who contacted Beason after her RTS Cambridge appearance. Jaeger Media is working with start-up and small-to-mid-size producers, artists and influencers to help them maximize commercial opportunities and protect their IP. The idea came after Finnan spotted the potential to take a “360 approach” on Peaky Blinders, which has seen clips of Steven Knight’s smash hit re-versioned for social via a number of “Best Ofs” that have delivered hunderds of thousands of views.

Streaming platforms have responded to this trend by partnering with influencers such as Netflix with Miss Rachel, Disney with the D’Amelios and Amazon with Molly-Mae Hague. “The hype of longform and monoculture being over is the biggest myth known to man,” adds Finnan. “My mum watches YouTube and she is 82.”\n\nFinnan and Beason are working on plenty upcoming projects together and in a sense they neatly represent how the content creator revolution is happening across all parts of the industry.\n\nBeason is quietly confident that those in charge are truly catching on and can save TV from “extinction,” as Chawawa terms it.\n\n“I just think if we can do this with our smart phones then we can help incredibly talented, experienced people with all the resources they have,” she adds. “I don’t think it’s too late.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T11:28:02.685013"}

But his unconventional promotional escapades have also seen Josh Safdie’s acclaimed ping-pong dramedy smash records for the studio across the Atlantic, where in the U.K. it has now become it’s highest-grossing title of all time.\n\nAccording to sources close to the project, late on Monday Jan. 5, the film surpassed “Civil War” — A24’s previous title-holder which took $8.2 million in 2024 — to claim its British crown. The achievement is even more impressive given that “Marty Supreme” managed this in less than two full weeks, having launched on Dec. 26, and with only one of those as a wide release. In its first weekend in approximately 130 locations, it took an astonishing $4.38 million (another A24 record).\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Marty Supreme” (which in the U.K. was distributed by regular A24 partners Entertainment Film Distributors) has now outgrossed the entire British box office of fellow sports feature “Challengers” ($8.1 million) while its wide break was higher than than the opening weekend of awards season rival “One Battle After Another” ($3.3 million). While the general industry approximation for films released in the U.K. is that they take roughly 10% of the domestic box office, Variety understands “Marty Supreme” will likely comfortably exceed this.\n\nSafdie’s film — a screwball sports-crime thriller loosely based on the life and career of U.S. table tennis player Marty Reisman — has received just as much praise in the U.K. as in the U.S., sitting atop many critics 2025 best of lists and with six pending nominations from the London Critics Circle. But several A24 films have had similar reactions. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” also earned six London Critics nominations, plus 10 BAFTA nods (winning one), but earned a total of $7.6 million at the U.K. box office. “Hereditary,” meanwhile, amassed $7.3 million.\n\nThe U.K. success of “Marty Supreme,” therefore, can fire an orange ping pong ball of gratitude to the one-man marketing machine that is Chalamet, who brought his offbeat promotional style to London in mid-December with the same viral effect it had in the U.S.\n\nOn Dec. 13, thousands of Chalamet fans, mostly teens and 20-somethings and prompted by a cryptic social media post from the actor the day before, flocked to a pop-up store in Holborn to try to get their hands on various fashion branded items, including the iconic “Marty Supreme” orange jacket that has become this season’s merch product du jour. Many travelled from around the U.K. Some camped overnight (through extreme wintery chills). According to reports, there were fights in the snake-like queue that formed.\n\nThere was also the ongoing speculation that Chalamet was leading a double life as the cult masked Brit rapper and drill artist EsDeeKid. While in the U.K., he quashed those rumors — already far-fetched given EsDeeKid’s Liverpudlian accent — by posting a video of himself rapping alongside the musician to a remix of his hit “4Raws.” Naturally, it went crazy on social media, with many U.K. rappers praising the track and video.\n\nBut perhaps the most out there moment, one that perhaps chimed with the U.K.’s taste for the offbeat and wacky, was when Chalamet praised former Britain’s Got Talent star Susan Boyle.\n\nScottish singer Boyle — who became a YouTube sensation in 2009 for her rendition of “I Dreamed a Dream” from “Les Miserables” — was one of a small handful of Brits he deemed worthy of a “Marty Supreme” jacket, named alongside Lewis Hamilton, David and Victoria Beckham and rapper Fakemink.\n\n“She dreamt bigger than all of us,” Chalamet told the BBC, adding that he remembered her 2009 moment “like it was yesterday.”\n\nChalamet was just 13 at the time and it’s anyone’s guess whether he was being honest about his appreciation for Boyle (who later sent him a message to celebrate his 30th birthday). But given A24’s record-breaking U.K. haul for “Marty Supreme” and a hugely positive start to the year in terms of original theatrical releases, few in the cinema industry are likely complaining.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:43:30 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T13:03:04.509191"}

The media-buying outlet, part of British ad giant WPP and once known as GroupM, is launching a new sports practice it says will harness better sets of data to help clients place their advertising dollars with increased confidence.\n\nMany advertisers have longstanding ties to certain sports events, but the amount of money being spent on professional and collegiate sports is soaring, says Martin Bilch, an executive director at WPP Media, and head of U.S. sports investments and partnerships, during a recent interview. “The truths is we need to be able to say to the client, ‘Hey, let’s take a step back and look at data, understand who the fan is, understand who the league delivers and the platforms they have access to that can really drive business.” Bilch will lead the new offering.\n\nWPP Media Sports, the new practice, will not only offer strategy and investment services, but also analytics; activation of sponsorships and partnerships; and content production tied to influencers. WPP Media Sports will use GumGum, a company that specializes in delivering digital ads in relevant environments, and Relo Metrics, which measures and tracks the value of sponsor logos and brand mentions across live TV broadcasts, streaming, social media, and other venues.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWPP Media launches a dedicated sports practice at the start of a heady year, one that will contain a Winter Olympics and a World Cup tournament, along with the usual NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL seasons. WPP Media has kept its eye on how sports has developed in a new era. In 2024, the company created a dedicated marketplace for women’s sports, starting in the industry’s “upfront” market. Clients including adidas, Ally, Coinbase, Discover, Google, Mars, Nationwide, Unilever and NBCUniversal’s Universal Pictures said at the time that they were interested.\n\nThe company is also seeking to redefine its business after several tough years marked by client losses and executive turnover. WPP Media Sports will vie with such entities as Publicis Media and the sports media operations of Omnicom Group, which recently acquired its rival, Interpublic Group .Advertisers have always relied on sports broadcasts to reach large audiences, but more of them are doing so in the streaming era. When traditional dramas and comedies are viewed increasingly at times of a consumer’s own choosing, sports remains one of the few programming formats that draws broad crowds together all at once — meaning a sponsor can reach more potential customers in a single moment.\n\nIn recent months, top sports events have sold out earlier and with greater speed than in the past — including the Super Bowl. NBCUniversal sold the bulk of its commercial inventory tied to next month’s telecast of Super Bowl LX months ahead of schedule.\n\nThe heightened demand for sports has boosted prices for all games and matches. ” That means there’s more realization that it’s more expensive to make a mistake,” says Bilch. “You can no longer just throw a piece of grass up in the arena and hope it flies in the right direction,” he says. “You have to have data and make the proper decisions as part of it.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T14:29:29.580074"}

The NFB ranks as the third most-nominated entity in that category after Disney and MGM, as NFB chairperson Suzanne Guèvremont noted to Variety just before 2025’s Annecy Animation Festival.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPacking emotional force but also a fable about be-careful-what you-wish-for greed, “”The Girl Who Cried Pearls” is both an ode to the craftsmanship of stop-motion puppetry and a groundbreaking blend of tactile puppetry with digital innovation, reaffirming Lavis and Szczerbowski ’s status as pioneers in contemporary animation, Variety has observed.\n\n“The Girl Who Cried Pearls” begins in Paris with the camera creeping up on a white marble mansion in a leafy street with a view of the Eiffel Tower – the epitome of bourgeois success. The granddaughter of its owner, a crickety old man, discovers a pearl in an red apple-shaped holder. “Of all the treasures in the entire room, you’ve guessed what’s most precious to me. It would seem someone has discovered my secret,” her grandfather confesses, quite willingly.\n\nPushed by his granddaughter to say what the secret is, he tells his tale of when he was a homeless street-kid in Montreal at the turn of the 20th century who spies on a young girl whose tears transform into iridescent small pearls. He falls in love with her, he says, but also secures two pearls which he sells to a pawnbroker – and sets out to make the girl cry more, breaking her heart.\n\nThroughout their career, Lavis and Szczerbowski have drunk deep at the well of surrealism, the artistic movement inspiring many of the 20th century’s achievements which set out to decry the rationality and sense of propriety of middle-classes, priming the workings of the unconscious, chance and a lack of creative control.\n\n“Madame Tutli-Putli,” the film 2008 Academy Awards contender which brought Lavis and Szczerbowski to notice, plays out, for instance, like the fever dream of a 1920s bourgeois flapper dreamt many decades later. The narrative imagines her younger self without a home and then on a train where logic is replaced by chance as she confronts her deepest fears: sex, robbery, helplessness, the death of others (the train has a morgue-like dining car) and the inevitability of extinction (she pictures a moth drawn to the light at the film’s finale). Or that at least could be one interpretation.\n\nA highly useful article on the Canada National Film Board’s blog quotes Lavis and Szczerbowski about how their animation on “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” was shaped by happy accident. One case in point: the original maquette of the decrepit house where the young boy shelters from winter cold was left outside the studio to dry. But an unexpected rain squall hit and by the time Lavis and Szczerbowski returned, the prop was warped out of shape.\n\n“It looked so much better that way, so we incorporated the warps into the final model,” they say.\n\nModel for the house in ‘The Girl Who Cried Pearls’ Credit: National Film Board of Canada\n\nThat is reminiscent of an anecdote about how the great surrealist Luis Buñuel was sitting in Madrid bar Chicote drinking dry martinis trying to work out how he could cast Angela Molina as the supposed femme fatale of “The Obscure Object of Desire” when he already had Carole Bouquet under contract. Buñuel realized that the film would work much better if they were both cast in the same role.\n\n“The Girl Who Cried Pearls” frames a tale within tale of the film, part set maybe 70 years later whose final stretches cannot be described without revealing multiple spoilers. Safe to say, however, that they add multiple levels of storytelling richness and reenforce the film’s social prescience in ages past and present of unfettered greed.\n\nThe 17-minute short is also animation art of the highest order, seen in the extraordinary bric-a-brac detail of a pawnshop, lending it an immersive authenticity. The puppets’ heads in the past are silicon moulds multi-layered by oil painting to look like aged wood. The film uses both claymation and plastic 3D printing and sets scrubbed with paint spread on garbage bags to make them look grimily weathered.\n\nVariety talked to Lavis and Maciek Szczerbowski about “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” which, produced by the National Film Board, was one of five shorts to open the 2025 Annecy Festival.\n\nIt also won the Short Cuts Award for best Canadian short film at the Toronto Festival and the Canadian Film Institute Award for best Canadian Animation at the Ottawa International Animation Festival, the second most important animation festival in the world.\n\nIn a conversation with your composer Patrick Watson and artistic director Brigitte Henry about making “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” you say, Maciek, that “without the right story, there is no value” in anything else. The grandfather says much the same towards the end of the film. I suspect here, as indeed in the film at large, that one key was the long time you spent making it, which maybe allowed you to evolve everything, including the story, more than is traditional in animation.\n\nMaciek Szczerbowski: This was our first story completely dependent on story. We joked that we usually make experimental films and the experiment this time was doing something traditional. For the most part, we’ve been exploring the worlds of dream logic and Dadaist accidents that create story in a kind of symbolistic way which we try to curate and control. Here the trick was to tell a very specific, concise story. If you don’t understand the two or three crucial moments, it probably means nothing. The result was almost like telling a joke— Proper timing. Good delivery.\n\nCould you give an early example of a crucial moment?\n\nSzczerbowski: Just a simple line which almost gets lost that the boy says about how he spent his days at Montreal’s old port, how he stole from boxes that had fallen off ships.\n\nChris Lavis: You’re absolutely right about how the story evolved as we worked on it. That’s a crucial element to the process. We had animated and edited the film and watched a first version and it didn’t work. It wasn’t virtuosic on any scale. It was stuttering. It had no proper structure. It was confusing. Two things happened. Our composer, Patrick Watson, made a suggestion that he needed the film to spend more time in the past, without cutting back to the present, for him to build the music properly.\n\nAnd the second?\n\nLavis: It didn’t feel like the grandfather was telling a story. Characters were just speaking dialogue in the grandfather’s voice. What we did – maybe the oldest trick of filmmakers after that first hellish edit—was we went back to the first impulse: The original treatment we gave to the National Film Board of Canada. We had written that like a short story. Those little narrative bridges missing from the grandfather’s dialogue were there in the original treatment. When we weaved them back into the film, it was like Eureka! Suddenly, the movie had structure and shape.\n\nWhich connects to the grandfather’s comment that “It’s always the story that gives something the value” and it’s the story of a girl whose tears become pearls is what strikes spectators most from the film….\n\nLavis: The story has two pillars. One, we were really interested in this idea of the grandfather, being extremely rich and wealthy and powerful, at the end of his life, discovering his granddaughter stealing something from his office and telling her his darkest secret. The second pillar is the idea that storytelling itself creates belief and value.\n\nSzczerbowski: In so many ways it’s a commentary on what people like us or writers do. You’re making value out of nothing by inventing a narrative, by building a mythology around an object that could otherwise have become utterly worthless, and turning it into something that could end up in a museum or be priceless.\n\nStorytelling dates back to the dawn of humankind. “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” could indeed be said to be in some ways traditionalist and in others, highly innovative, as Variety noted of your work in general. Making the film was often about using the new or making the new look old…..\n\nSzczerbowski: We wanted the story to feel like it was found in a box from 50 years ago. That’s the whole point of that process of aging and using garbage bags and paint. Oil paint is to remove the author from the process in a way. Especially when you’re creating a fable, you don’t want it to feel like a couple of guys were sitting around inventing a fable. It should feel like it came from the collective unconscious.\n\nA highly useful article on the National Film Board blog quotes you about how your animation was shaped by happy accident. One case in point: how you incorporated the rain-drenched warped version of your original maquette into the final model.\n\nLavis: We call chance an invisible collaborator.\n\nSzczerbowski: This is part of our education, I guess. At some point, we were reading an article about Frank Gehry, the architect. He would build a maquette for a building he was designing and when it hit a particular level of of satisfaction where he knew he could have actually stopped, he would throw it out the window, and take the elevator down to the sidewalk collect all the pieces and re-glue it, knowing that it would never actually fit perfectly ever again, that there would be an element of chaos and accident. What John Cage calls indeterminacy. Something beautiful happens. You have to have had some experience in removing your own ego from your work in order to even play with these things.\n\nLavis: You get sick of your own decisions, too. That’s what makes it interesting.\n\nSzczerbowski: And you’re looking forward to surprise. The whole point of us working in in collaboration is to look forward to these moments when this kind of indeterminacy happens, either because of a thunderstorm or the other person’s intervention. Usually what you get at the end is something that is really different than what you thought it would look like. For some that might be a failure, but to us it’s always a boon.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:42:21 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T14:53:34.448682"}

A computer program could never replicate her signature gleaming smile — the one that lights up Notting Hill and Pretty Woman — or the inner turmoil that tortures Alma, the Yale philosophy professor she captures so astutely in Luca Guadagnino’s riveting drama After the Hunt.\n\nHere’s an actor of quiet ambition, fire and energy who every so often unleashes a raw power that infuses a character with life and truth. It’s her best role since she played the titular Erin Brockovich a quarter of a century ago, collecting an Academy Award along the way. On Sunday, the star is a best dramatic actress nominee at the Golden Globes for After the Hunt.\n\nJulia Roberts and Luca Guadagnino on ‘After the Hunt’ set Amazon\n\nJust the other day, Richard Curtis, who penned Notting Hill, voiced a belief that AI can never replace an actor, a screenwriter or any filmmaking creative.\n\n“I don’t believe it’s possible either,” Roberts insists. “I think that at the root of every book and play and movie and TV show and essay and article is someone’s heart and soul, and those are not manufacturable.”\n\nAre we at a dangerous crossroads?\n\n“Yes,” she responds. “I think it’s interesting what AI can do for medicine, things like that. I think that’s something that as a world we should be so proud of and interested in.”\n\nBut she doesn’t engage in AI, and she’s “never used ChatGPT because I think it’s a slippery slope, right? Anytime you find that shortcut for something, and at first you go, ‘Oh, this is great.’ But is it?” Her voice sounds troubled.\n\nThese are concerns, too, for the future of the theatrical moviegoing experience.\n\nRoberts shakes her head in agreement and says: “I think I like to maintain a robust sense of optimism for all things. I remember, there was a moment during Covid where I was talking to Bryan Lourd, my agent. We had this long conversation, and I got off the phone with him and … it was a moment where I thought, ‘It’s over. We’ll never be in a movie theater again.’ I just sat in my little rocking chair and just wept.”\n\nThe tears came, she tells me, at “the idea of that part of our culture being gone was so heartbreaking because I do find it so meaningful and so fun.”\n\nRELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nEspecially now, she continues, “with everybody with their heads down like this…” She lowers her head, as if reading a cell phone. “Where else do you sit with a group of people where everybody has their heads up, and you’re all kind of sharing energetically the same story? It’s a really unique thing to do in the theater — and in the movie theater— and the idea of that disappearing forever, it’s too heartbreaking for me to believe it could happen.”\n\nIt’s tricky though, isn’t it, what with the theater of war that Netflix and Paramount are waging over the future of Warner Bros? “Listen,” Roberts sighs, “it’s all dollars and cents, right? So hopefully, people keep going.”\n\nAyo Edebiri and Julia Roberts in ‘After the Hunt’ Yannis Drakoulidis /Amazon\n\nAs much as After the Hunt follows a clash of cultures — the cancel kind, plus social and moral differences — that follow when Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), one of Alma’s students alleges that faculty member Hank (Andrew Garfield) sexually assaulted her, it’s the beautifully bizarre, damaged, wonderful marriage between Alma and Frederick, her psychologist husband (Michael Stuhlbarg) that grips.\n\nRELATED: ‘After The Hunt’: Read The Screenplay From First-Time Scribe Nora Garrett That Refuses To Offer Easy Answers\n\nNora Garrett wrote the screenplay, but it’s Guadagnino’s brilliant imagination that ensures Alma is the troubled beating heart of this film. And it’s clear from our conversation that Roberts leapt at the opportunity to work with him. The result for her is a sublime performance; unmissable for me.\n\nHe’s one of the most thoughtful, knowledgeable, deep, passionate people she’s ever met, Roberts says. “It goes on and on — what he knows, what he can absorb and comprehend and learn and retain and then share in a variety of languages. I mean, it’s kind of astonishing. I’ve never really encountered a person like him,” Roberts says as she continues to richly exalt her Sicilian artistic benefactor.\n\nRoberts believes that he was a springboard for “my enthusiasm. … I think everything he said I wrote down, I was constantly making notes, thinking, ‘I have to look up who this person is. I need to see what this book is about.’ Just to create this sense of the academic world as its own universe,” she says.\n\nI share Roberts’s enthusiasm for Guadagnino, having been a fan ever since Tilda Swinton tipped me off about his feature debut, The Protagonists, which she starred in for him back in 1999.\n\nAfter the Hunt is studded with references to Alma and Frederick’s marriage. At one point, Garfield’s Hank belittles the idea of Frederick because he’s at home preparing a cassoulet for their supper, but Alma staunchly defends him: “He’s my husband. He’s always going to be there.”\n\nRoberts says that she’s had some really profound conversations with friends about the marriage in the movie, citing one in particular she had with George Clooney. “I think it’s probably the most serious conversation we’ve had in 30 years. It had so much to do with the marriage story in the movie and how he felt about that. I think that George, you, myself, we’re kind of all of a certain age where we really appreciate when a story, a book, a movie — something that shows us the layers and the layers and the layers of something.”\n\nMost of the scenes involving Roberts and Stuhlbarg are when Alma and Frederick are alone together. The two actors developed a close rapport, though it would seem that both approach things differently, a comment that elicits giggles from Roberts.\n\nMichael Stuhlbarg and Julia Roberts in ‘After the Hunt’ Yannis Drakoulidis/Amazon MGM Studios\n\nHow so, I venture to ask? It’s something to do with how they each treated their copies of the script; Stuhlbarg’s pages were so pristine, Roberts recalls. “His notes were tiny. He had these straight lines and these small squiggly lines, and it was like hieroglyphics. And my script notoriously looks like it’s spent the night in a hamster cage. It’s my own madness, one that I never truly took note of until I looked at Michael’s script. And so I think that we melded within our differences. We just liked being with someone who was so different. And we also just had a real comfort in sharing physical space. I think he was comfortable with me physically. That scene in the kitchen where he’s on his knees and he’s got his head in my lap? We just understood our space together.”\n\nThe film smartly foreshadows what will befall Alma and Maggie and Hank. When Alma and her students discuss Michel Foucault’s ideas concerning the panopticon — the idea that people can be controlled by extreme surveillance —it’s a foreboding of the public torture that Alma will endure because of her reaction to Maggie’s ordeal. Another instance is when Stuhlbarg’s Fredrick notes that seeking tenure will make Alma above accountability, which one can relate to the sheer lack of accountability we observe at the highest echelons of public life.\n\nRELATED: Luca Guadagnino And ‘After The Hunt’ Cast Talk Woody Allen Inspiration & The Film’s Politics: “It’s Not About Making A Manifesto Of Old-Fashioned Values” — Venice\n\n“Listen,” says Roberts, “the timeliness of the parallels of just the idea of people striving to be in positions of power — for lack of a more interesting word — for the ultimate goal of not being responsible and accountable, that’s the horror of the modern world right now.”\n\nRoberts finds it “great and interesting” to take “this massive horror” and put it into the arena of academia. It is, she says, “a place that’s small enough that you can see the whole, you can see every cog in the wheel. Because sometimes I just feel like I read the newspaper and you almost can’t comprehend…” Her face suddenly fills with anguish. “I think that’s very Luca to make something that you really can hold and examine.”\n\nSo what ails Alma? Roberts reckons “her genesis is pain. … The tree of Alma, that’s where it starts. And so I think to understand why she is the way she is and speaks the way she does and performs the way she does, whether at home or at school, it’s all trauma. … How did she find a place, make a decision to say to herself, ‘How can I best make it work for a life?’ and part of it is the masonry, right? You build the wall. The bricks of her wall are made of all these philosophers and all these concepts and all these things that she can proclaim from on high, because if you’re talking about all these other people and all these other things, you’re never talking about yourself.”\n\nJulia Roberts in ‘After the Hunt’\n\nThe reason Alma and Frederick’s marriage “works so beautifully” is, she believes, “because Frederick is the only person that knows her pain, sees all of her and loves her in spite of that, loves her because, loves her anyway, loves her always. And she knows that. And I think there is no Frederick without Alma. There is no Alma without Frederick. And I think that’s how she survives.”\n\nRELATED: ‘After The Hunt’ Writer Nora Garrett Reveals The Political Event That Impacted Her, And Her On-Set Experience With Luca Guadagnino And Julia Roberts\n\nAlma’s attire is also part of her survival kit. Roberts explains that hair designer Massimo Gattabrusi (Queer, Challengers) and makeup designer Fernanda Perez (A Bigger Splash, Call Me By Your Name), both regular collaborators of Guadagnino’s, molded her look, with Gena Rowlands at the center of their mood board.\n\n“They are avid researchers,” she says, “and they came in with a lot of materials for us to look at, and talk about — what the look was to be. It’s a uniform. She’s not spending time getting ready, and yet, make no mistake, there’s thought put into every little piece of everything, every loafer, every brush of the hair. And so it was interesting to try to create this studied look that seemed effortless. And definitely Gena Rowlands [was an influence]. We had so many pictures of her in the hair and makeup room.”\n\nInterestingly, she and Rowlands appeared together in 1995’s Something to Talk About.\n\n“So I knew her,” Roberts says. “And I was able to adore her up close for a period of time. So many of the characters that she played, they had this internal [dynamic]. It was like a Jenga game, and you just didn’t know when it was going to tumble. She was so good at that, the nuance of that quality. I think that was something that Luca and I discussed, just trying to find that internal nuance for Alma.”\n\nJohn Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands AMPAS\n\nSadly, she notes, Rowlands died the day after the film wrapped. “We were all gutted. We couldn’t believe it. Every day I would just sit and stare at pictures of her while I was getting ready for work in the makeup room. She was such a legend, such an inspiration.”\n\nRELATED: Gena Rowlands Dies: ‘The Notebook’, ‘Gloria’ And ‘A Woman Under the Influence’ Star Was 94\n\nThe mention of Rowlands makes us both hark back to a time when audiences welcomed challenging movies like After the Hunt, where the answers weren’t fed to you. Like you would come out of the film and you’d have a heated discussion on the way home with your wife or with friends. The added benefit of After the Hunt has been is the number of fights one has participated in over dinner — even Christmas Day lunch— arguing over this movie. It’s rare, and I ask whether Roberts feels that as well.\n\n“I do,” she responds. “I think that is my greatest sense of accomplishment with this movie, where this person thought this and this person thought that. My friends would see it and go, ‘Oh, well, we have to see it again. I mean, because she thinks this and I think that.’”\n\nRoberts explains that when Guadagnino came to London to show her the film, she was on another movie, director Sam Esmail’s thriller Panic Carefully, starring Eddie Redmayne, Elizabeth Olsen, Brian Tyree Henry, Joe Alwyn and Ben Chaplin. Roberts says that she refused to sit with Guadagnino, just the two of them, to watch the movie. “That sounds like a complete nightmare,” she recalls telling him.\n\nGuadagnino allowed her to invite Esmail, some cast mates from Panic Carefully, along with crew from After the Hunt that resided in London, about a dozen or so, and following the screening they hadn’t reached the exit doors before they stopped in a huddle for half an hour. “It was so wonderful just to hear how many different ways people examine it.”\n\nRELATED: ‘After The Hunt’ Review: Julia Roberts Is Superb In Luca Guadagnino’s Biting Campus #MeToo Drama – Venice Film Festival\n\nBut while the film has its champions — such as Deadline’s film critic Damon Wise — it’s also had its share of detractors, especially some critics and social commentators in the United States who have vilified it. Roberts thinks that’s what makes it really robust, saying, ”Everybody’s going to get something slightly different in their interpretation.”\n\nFrom left: Andrew Garfield, Luca Guadagnino, Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri and Chloe Sevigny at the ‘After the Hunt’ premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival Getty Images\n\nLike me, Roberts is fascinated about which movies “float to the top” and what doesn’t, and who exactly determines that. She suggests that she’d like to attend a dinner party at my house to further discuss this topic. I suggest she bring plenty of her own ammunition. “I’m unafraid, Baz. I’m unafraid,” she says with mock bravado. (Actually, maybe not so mock!)\n\nI ask her about rumors suggesting she might have plans to return to the stage. Is it true?\n\n“I hope it’s true, “ she responds. “It’s been a long-held dream of mine to do that. And now that our kids are grown up, I think it affords me more of the space for something like that.”\n\nI saw her make her Broadway debut in Richard Greenberg’s play Three Days of Rain, directed by Joe Mantello, with Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd in 2006. “The three of us, just scared out of our minds,” she says of that experience. Mantello, who also acted with her in the screen version of Larry Kramer’s The Normal Heart, has remained a good friend all these years.\n\nRELATED: ‘After The Hunt’ Trailer: Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield & Ayo Edebiri Star In Psychological Thriller\n\nShe’s open to doing something here in London, she says. “Of course I would, yes. I mean, it’s funny because there are these tiny theaters that are near our apartment in New York and little places near our house here [in San Francisco]. And I just think, ‘Oh, that would be so fun to do a play in a really small space.’ Almost like a workshop, almost like going to theater school, but people have to buy tickets to school.” She lets out that famous laugh. “Fingers crossed. It would be so great.”\n\nShe doesn’t return to it often, but she has long loved the idea of the stage. “I just think there’s really nothing like it; I’ve loved it since I was, like, a 7-year-old and saw Yul Brenner in The King and I at the Atlantic Civic Center Theater.” She remembers thinking, “This is the most magical thing a person can do with their life.”\n\nAnother movie with Guadagnino is also on her dance card. “He already has an idea for us, and every time I see him, he’s like, ‘Darling, this is what we’re going to do.’ I would pack my bags now to go do another movie with Luca,” she declares.\n\nAndrew Garfield and Julia Roberts in ‘After the Hunt’ Yannis Drakoulidis/Amazon\n\nIs that a serious proposition or just polite casual conversation? Smiling, then sighing, Roberts explains: “This is what I know about Luca: He is the most prolific. I mean, even this movie, this is the fastest I have ever read a script, talked to a director and ended up on a soundstage in my 30-plus-year career. The fastest. So when Luca says he has an idea, and he’s going to write a script, it wouldn’t surprise me if it comes as a late Christmas parcel.”\n\nRoberts seems eager to experience working with Guadagnino again, even to play a character the complete antithesis of her — just as Alma was.\n\n“She’s so different from my personality, from every natural instinct that I have towards the day, a person, a space. [I am,] I would say, almost opposite to her. And so in that regard, it’s very tiring and, in a way, kind of sad. I like to share a space, not command a space. And so I found those days the hardest in a way, especially with all those actors sitting at their desks looking at me with these big eyes with such expectations. And I was happy to leave it all behind, but I was also…” She looks for the words. “I felt so gratified.”\n\nShe reveals that she keeps in regular touch with Guadagnino, Garfield and Edebiri and has done ever since the movie wrapped. What do they talk about?\n\n“Life,” she shrugs. “I think Ayo and I became such good friends. I admire her so much, and I really, truly adore her. I think she’s one of the most talented young people I have ever spent time with,” Roberts adds her voice quivering on the verge of unexpected tears. Her feelings for Edebiri “are so profound,” she says.\n\nThe friendship developed during rehearsals, and then a confrontation in the film between their characters culminated in a slap. That “sealed the deal” and it was like “friends for life,” she trills.\n\nRELATED: Ayo Edebiri Recalls Slapping Julia Roberts For ‘After The Hunt’ Scene After Bonding During Rehearsal: “It Was Horrible”\n\nOur conversation goes on to encompass her romantic comedy classics, such as Roger Michell’s Notting Hill, based on a script by Richard Curtis. Did she have any sense, 27 years or more ago, that it would become an enduring favorite?\n\nJulia Roberts in ‘Notting Hill’ (1999) Everett\n\n“Gosh, I just remember when my agent called me about Notting Hill and I thought, ‘Well, that sounds like the dumbest idea of any movie I could ever do. I’m going to play the world’s biggest movie star and I do what? And then what happens? This sounds so f*cking stupid.’ And then I read the script, and I was like, ‘Oh. This is so charming. It’s so funny. Oh, shit.’ And then I went to lunch with Richard [Curtis] and [producer] Duncan [Kenworthy] and beloved Roger Michell, may he rest in peace.”\n\nRELATED: Roger Michell Dies: ‘Notting Hill’ Director Was 65\n\nThe lunch was fun, she recalls, even though her initial intent was to tell them, “No, this isn’t going to work. I’m passing on this movie.” “And they were just so charming and sweet and funny. And I thought, ‘Wow, this is really going to happen.’ And we had a beautiful time doing it. It was cast to perfection [by Mary Selway], all the friends, everybody. It was so great. And we had a beautiful time. And I think Roger, he just created the film in a way that it just, at every turn, it succeeded. It accomplished its goals with every…” She pauses. “Alec Baldwin!” she exclaims. “That’s brilliant casting.”\n\nWe chat about comedy; the structure, the architecture of it. There’s a math to it, Roberts suggests. “Because there is a math, but I think it changes depending on the kind of comedy that it is. Garry Marshall [who directed her in Pretty Woman] would always say that a joke is in three parts, like a drum beat. I mean, people have their different ways of looking at it. For me, I think it would just depend on what the goal is. But I mean, the joy of life is making people laugh for me. Especially my husband, if I can make my husband really laugh — because he makes me really laugh — then it just fills me up.”\n\nWhat’s the secret sauce of a Julia Roberts laugh? A cinematic treasure, I wonder? “It’s not something for oneself to analyze,” she theorizes. “I think it comes from an authentic place of complete joy that I was just born of. It’s a credit to my parents, I suppose.”\n\nSkirting back to Pretty Woman, it occurs to me to ask whether the philosopher Alma would have approved of the Vivian Ward character Roberts plays and of the film itself? Roberts roars with laughter. “This is going to be food for thought for the day!”\n\nAlso, would Julia Roberts — had she been the right age — made Pretty Woman today?\n\nRichard Gere and Julia Roberts in ‘Pretty Woman’ (1990) Touchstone Pictures\n\n“Oh, it’s impossible. I have too many years of the weight of the world inside of me now that I wouldn’t be able to kind of levitate in a movie like that, right? I mean, not weight of the world, like, negative, but just all the things that we learn, all the things that we put in our pockets along the lane. It would be impossible to play someone who was really innocent, in a way. I mean, it’s a funny thing to say about a hooker, but I do think that there was an innocence to her, a kind of…” She pauses. “ I guess it’s just being young.”\n\nOver the years, many have stopped seeing Pretty Woman as an affectionate fairytale.\n\n“Well, I think anytime you have a huge passage of time and cultural shifts…” she muses. “Think about all the movies and plays of the ’20s and ’30s and ’40s — you would look at them now and just be like, ‘How are people saying these things, doing these things?’”\n\nLook at Gone With the Wind, for example, she says. “I think these are the choices that we make as artists, as art appreciators and people that love to read books and go to the theater and yeah, times change, people change, ideas change.”\n\nRoberts famously supports Manchester United and loves watching the footy on television. “Of course it’s more exciting when you’re there, live. Everything is,” she chortles. The World Cup looms large in her future with the hope of tickets to see the elite players perform at the game’s ultimate competition.\n\nRELATED: FIFA 2026 World Cup: Full Schedule & Fixtures For Groups And Knockout Stages\n\n“This has been quite the constant conversation on our house,” Roberts admits as a megawatt smile begins to form.\n\nBefore that, though, is the chance to get her feet wet one more time in Ocean’s 14. Is that on, I ask? “That’s what George says. I’m on his team.”\n\nThis is where pure mathematics is deployed to reassemble the ensemble. “We finally figured out how to align our schedules,” she says. “These are complicated schedules,” she notes while relaying that her Ocean’s teammate Don Cheadle will be starring with Edebiri on Broadway in a revival of David Auburn’s play Proof for a limited run in the spring and early summer. “There’s so many things to have to consider, but when George gets a bee in his bonnet, things happen.”\n\nGeorge Clooney and Julia Roberts\n\nSpeaking of Clooney, we chuckle over the running gag in Jay Kelly where his eponymous character, a movie star, finds that every set, hotel and trailer he visits includes a rider that dictates a slice of cheesecake at every stop, even though he detests the dessert. After watching the film, Roberts started to notice that everywhere she goes, “there is either a huge bag or a huge bowl of raw almonds. I have no idea why,” she shrugs.\n\nRELATED: George Clooney Plays A Fictional Movie Star In ‘Jay Kelly’ But He’s Not The First – Here’s 10 Of The Best…\n\nAnd does she even like these nuts? “I like them, but not in bulk!” she says, gesticulating wildly with her hands. “I mean, they’re everywhere I go. It’s so funny. And so I just recently sent an email since watching Jay Kelly, since seeing all these almonds, I sent email and said, ’In the new year, one thing I would really like to do is review any and all riders that pertain to me in this world, because I think it might be time for a little reset on the almonds.’”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T14:53:35.327737"}

Antiheroine Harper Stern (Myha’la) is arguably the latter, having parlayed a fake college transcript into a position atop her very own fund. But Harper may have met her match, or at least a mirror, in Whitney Halberstram (Max Minghella), another American who’s attempting to reinvent themselves in London’s money market. Whitney is the co-founder and CFO of Tender, a payment processor known for supporting gray-market industries like gambling and pornography that’s trying to evolve into a legitimate bank. Harper is running a shorts-only operation, betting against companies she sees as overvalued and (hopefully) making money in the process. When Harper sets her sights on Tender, she ignites a war that gives the season its heart-pounding momentum.\n\nZoom out, however, and you can see why “Industry” creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay are so concerned with external perception. At the end of Season 3, the former Oxford classmates — whose brief stints in banking inspired the show — effectively burned their initial setup to the ground. “Industry” began with a quartet of new graduates, including Harper and pampered publishing heiress Yasmin Kara-Hanani (Marisa Abela), getting hired as grunt-work analysts at the fictional Pierpoint & Co. Slowly and then all at once, this shared setting started to fracture. Harper got fired for the aforementioned deception. Ensemble members like David Jonsson and Harry Lawtey left to pursue other opportunities, and thus their characters did as well. Yasmin exited finance altogether, embracing her destiny as the socialite bride-to-be of blue-blooded aristocrat Henry Muck (Kit Harington). And to cap it all off, Pierpoint itself collapsed after an ill-advised pivot into so-called ethical investing. The trading floor that saw so much of the series’s action is no longer in operation.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDown and Kay could’ve called it right there, leaving “Industry” a tight, compressed yarn about the compromises of early adulthood. Instead, they opted to forge ahead, in part because Season 3 was the first to be a bona fide hit rather than a cult favorite of critics like myself. The downfall of Pierpoint has afforded the pair, who direct half of the new season in addition to showrunning, that most exciting and terrifying of prospects: a blank slate. The resulting vacuum creates the potential for wildly divergent paths in the meta arc of the show. One is that “Industry” rises from the ashes to become bigger and more ambitious than ever, joining the upper tier of HBO’s roster. The other is that, without its distinct angle and grounding ballast, “Industry” tips over into grandiosity, never quite establishing a sound basis for moving past such a natural endpoint.\n\nOver eight episodes, Season 4 hews much closer to the latter end of this spectrum than the former. The transition is not, nor would it likely ever be, seamless; about once an episode, especially the early ones, there’s a moment that made me worry “Industry” had jumped the shark into pure provocation. But as the Tender plot — which Down and Kay have said was inspired by “Michael Clayton,” an influence that grows increasingly more apparent — gets going, the season tightens and accelerates. And “Industry” continues to drill down on Harper and Yasmin’s relationship, a dynamic Season 3 identified as the heart of the show by elevating Abela to effective co-lead. She and Myha’la are better than ever in Season 4 as both their characters start to understand their seeming happy endings didn’t afford them as much freedom as they thought.\n\nIt’s true that the loss of a bottom-up perspective makes “Industry” less distinct on the page from analogs like “Succession” or “Billions.” In fact, “Industry” positively revels in its characters’ newfound status; the premiere sees a comfortably retired Eric Tao (Ken Leung) share a golf course with a distant, red-capped figure we’re meant to understand is Donald J. Trump, while Harper goes to visit her benefactor Otto Mostyn (Roger Barclay) in Parliament, where he’s recently joined the House of Lords. Once upwardly mobile strivers, these people are now firmly ensconced in the halls of power — an ideal opportunity for them to reenact the abuses they used to suffer from above.\n\nThat’s the real difference-maker: The audience didn’t meet Harper and Yasmin at the top. We know exactly what it’s taken and all they’ve endured to get where they are, from the strong implication that Yasmin’s father sexually abused her to Harper’s estrangement from her mother and twin brother. So when Harper realizes Otto’s backing comes with more strings than he’d led her to believe, or Yasmin has to do the heavy lifting when Henry’s loss of a safe parliamentary seat sends him into a tailspin of depression, we feel their disappointments as acutely as their triumphs. They’re the bridge that takes “Industry” from Pierpoint into its wider, if not necessarily brighter, future.\n\nThis transition nonetheless necessitates an infusion of new blood, especially from outside the world of finance. At Tender, Whitney clashes with his more hedonistic co-founder Jonah (Kal Penn) and bosses around his assistant Haley (Kiernan Shipka). Harper is tipped off to Tender’s shady dealings by reporter Jim Dycker (Charlie Heaton), widening a foothold in the world of journalism previously established by Henry’s tabloid baron uncle Alexander (Andrew Havill). Henry’s election defeat reflects the real-life Labour wave of 2024, introducing fresh faces like business minister Lisa (Chloe Pirrie) and MP Jenny (Amy James-Kelly) for Tender to lobby as it navigates regulatory hurdles. What was once a show about business is now a cross-section of the overlapping institutions that make up the status quo, and how much disruptors like Harper and Whitney can — or can’t — change them.\n\nAlumni of shows like “Mad Men,” “Stranger Things” and “Dept. Q” are a sign of “Industry’s” increased sway, though none ever threaten to steal the show from Harper and Yasmin’s electric, resentment-laden frenmity. (Yasmin may no longer have anything as tawdry as “a job,” but her new role as a behind-the-scenes connector of the rich and influential keeps her in Harper’s orbit.) But for those who stick around, a standout can work their way into the show’s core with surprising speed. It can be hard to remember Sweetpea Golightly (Miriam Petche), the Pierpoint intern who paid her way through university with OnlyFans nudes, was introduced only last season. Now doing research for Harper, whose adamant defense of Sweetpea’s erstwhile gig reveals a soft side to the ruthless Machiavellian, she’s by far the easiest ensemble member to root for. Though with this crowd, that’s not a high bar.\n\nThe widening scope makes it more difficult for “Industry” to maintain a consistent baseline. Often, Down and Kay play this to their advantage; a West African interlude quite literally takes the show to new places, while a spotlight on Yasmin’s domestic disappointment swaps Nathan Micay’s electronic score for “Barry Lyndon”-like strings. At other times, the sex and drugs that have been part of the “Industry” DNA from the start begin to feel more discordant. The show continues to up the ante of everyone’s after-hours activities, even as they mature and have more to lose. Keeping everyone together, or even on the same continent, requires some mild contortions: a move to New York Harper floated in the Season 3 finale clearly did not come to pass, while a diminished Rishi (Sagar Radia) continues to hang around even after his life has completely collapsed.\n\nBut stepping back to consider the sheer difficulty of what “Industry” is attempting puts these growing pains in perspective. Season 3 was the culmination of several years of pent-up tension. Season 4 is building something, if not entirely new, then without much of the scaffolding that once gave “Industry” a consistent structure. It’s an effort so commendable in principle and enjoyable in practice that a little leeway is the least “Industry” can ask. And by moving this far beyond Pierpoint, the show has proven it can, and should, keep going further still.\n\n“Industry” Season 4 will premiere on HBO and HBO Max on Jan. 11 at 9 p.m. ET, with remaining episodes airing weekly on Sundays.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T15:30:25.005954"}

The film also played to sold out crowds at its international premiere at the Busan International Film Festival.\n\n“I’ve always been drawn to Korean rock music, but The Rose’s story is so much more,” said Yi. “It’s not easy to make it as a rock band anywhere these days, but their faith in their music and their faith in each other took them from the streets of Seoul to the outdoor stage at Coachella. Their journey, their candor, their message – and of course, their music – all make this the kind of film I’ve wanted to see for a long time. It was an absolute privilege to direct it, and I can’t wait to share it with fans and moviegoers around the world.”\n\n“This film captures our story beyond the stage.

But more importantly, the band’s message of ‘music as healing’ and learning their inner stories and struggles gave us a unique window into what felt like a coming of age movie, that transcended music altogether.

How do we square his offscreen cruelty with his laid-back comic artistry, especially when you can see a distinct glimmer of the former in the latter?", "content": "When you watch “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” Marina Zenovich’s spry and fascinating dark-side-of-a-comedian documentary, you hear countless tales of Chevy Chase’s casual cruelty and too-wise-for-you attitude and devotion to behaving badly — or, at least, mouthing off so rudely that it became a form of behavior. If you go into the movie wanting to be shocked and appalled, you won’t be disappointed. Off camera, a lot of comedians have prickly and difficult personalities. But there’s prickly and then there’s the unique drive-by karma of Chevy Chase, a comedian who helped to invent “Saturday Night Live,” who proved to be a singular and hilarious master of ironic barbed detachment, who became one of the most celebrated movie stars of the 1980s, and who was such a famously nasty and unpleasant person to deal with that the word “asshole” followed him around as if it was his middle name.\n\nThe stories are legion, and they all get told here. According to Chase’s old friend Peter Aaron, who met him at Bard College in 1965, Chevy, in the dining-hall commons, would pull stunts like reaching for the salt and knocking a glass of water over onto someone’s lap. He was a jerk, yet in his way he was already warming up for “Saturday Night Live.” Ten years later, as “SNL” was being pulled together, Lorne Michaels wanted him to be a writer, but Chase insisted that he be on camera. We see his audition tape, and two things strike you about it: that he was shockingly tall and handsome for a comedian, with a puckishness that someone this good-looking wasn’t supposed to have, and that the hostility came off him like plumes of electro-static. Backstage, he was so high-handed that he took it upon himself to give the other cast members notes.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAfter becoming a movie star, Chase gave Mike Ovitz a Cartier clock engraved on the back with “Keep getting me the $6 million.” John Carpenter says that working with Chase on “Memoirs of an Invisible Man” (1992) was so hellish it made him want to quit the business. And when Chase hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1985, he fastened on Terry Sweeney, the show’s first openly gay cast member, and baited him for being gay, suggesting that in the midst of the AIDS epidemic there might be a comedy routine in Sweeney getting weighed each week.\n\n“I could see right away,” recalls Aykroyd in the documentary, “that this guy was simultaneously talented and very dangerous.” Alan Greisman, a film producer who became a friend of Chase’s (even though Chevy, on the set of the 1981 movie they made together, “Modern Problems,” did as much cocaine as the burnout character he was playing), says, “I don’t think he consciously wants to be an asshole. I think the asshole version of him is somebody who is desperate for something he either lost or doesn’t have.” Based on what we hear in “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” to say that Chase acted like an asshole doesn’t do justice to his distemper. He was a passive-aggressive bully who perfected his own sadistic brand of Zen flippancy. He was a person who would bait you to your face, then add insult to injury by implying that it was all a joke.\n\nIt seemed, at the time, an attitude that was quite contempo in its heartlessness. But Chase’s sense of humor was actually based on something that had its roots in the 1960s. At the time, it was called the put-on. You say something, you don’t mean it (except that maybe, deep down, you do), and it’s all an act of thinly veiled aggression, because you’re putting one over on The Man, or someone you don’t like, or a person who doesn’t deserve to be talked to straight. But Chase ratcheted up the put-on in two ways. He made it crazy and surreal, and unlike Bill Murray, who had an affectionate counterculture shagginess, Chase stripped the put-on of any vestige of social-political morality. He was putting on just because…he wanted to fuck with you. And that became his entire personality.\n\nAs a documentary filmmaker, Marina Zenovich has long been drawn to difficult personalities, like Roman Polanski (she made two films about him) and Robin Williams, but it’s not just because she sees the drama in their turbulence (though that’s part of it). She also wants to grapple — and does, brilliantly — with what you might call the primal issue of politically incorrect artists. Namely, what are we supposed to do with these figures who create extraordinary things, who are cherished by people around the globe, yet have seriously problematic lives and personalities? Zenovich isn’t doing a harangue against “cancel culture.” She’s asking, in a far more ingenuous and exploratory way: What do we think about someone like Chevy Chase? How do we square his offscreen cruelty with his laid-back comic artistry, especially when you can see a distinct glimmer of the former in the latter?\n\nZenovich interviews the 82-year-old Chevy Chase today, seated at a table in his comfy suburban home in Bedford, NY, and the interview, in its way, is a performative psychodrama. Chevy wants to be honest, he wants to tell it like it is, but he’s also a compulsive cut-up and control freak whose guardedness takes the form of lashing out. “This is the way I am, at my age,” he says after telling an X-rated joke about Bill and Hillary Clinton. “Just a child. An angry child.” He knows himself too well. A child is exactly what Chase is. He won’t grow up. Early on, Zenovich tells him that she’s simply trying to figure him out. “No shit!” he says, adding, “It’s not going to be easy for you.” Why not? “You’re not bright enough. How’s that?” Then he gives her a frozen smile of triumph. “My answer is: I’m complex, and I’m deep, and I can be hurt easily, and I react spontaneously to people who want to figure me out.”\n\nThe film shows you how he got to be this way: raised by a mother with possible schizophrenic tendencies who would wake him up by slapping him, and by an abusive stepfather. His childhood was a hellhole. His entire “I’m Chevy Chase and you’re not, and by the way go fuck yourself” personality is a damaged person’s defense mechanism. So maybe it’s no surprise that while the Chase we see here is undeniably a dick (at this point it’s his brand), he also has disarming spasms of vulnerability and guilt, and when he wants to be he’s quite sweet. He’s someone who made the choice, over and over again, to be an asshole. Yet his fans adore him. He gets a large bag of fan mail each week, all of which he answers by signing photographs, and we see him at holiday time, going on his annual jaunt to speak at local showings of “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation,” a movie as beloved by children of the ’80s as “A Christmas Story” is. He treats his fans with grace and something like modesty. He has also been married, for 43 years, to Jayni Chase, an agile sweetheart who appears devoted to him. Does any of this give him absolution? No, but it does make him a complicated asshole.\n\nFifty years later, the extraordinary rocket ship of Chase’s career is still a marvel to behold — how he helped to define “SNL,” inventing Weekend Update as a showcase for his WASP-on-nut-pills aggro deadpan, and how he left the show way too early, because Hollywood was calling (and because his second wife, Jacqueline Carlin, refused to move from L.A. to New York). Over the last year, I’ve called both “Annie Hall” and “When Harry Met Sally” the launchpad of the revival of the romantic comedy, but “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” made me realize that I was wrong. Both those films were instrumental, but the launch of the cheeseball genre that the rom-com became really goes back to Chase’s first big movie, “Foul Play” (1978), a film that looks better in hindsight. He and Goldie Hawn had a skewed chemistry in it, and Hawn is on hand in the doc testifying to how much the asshole could, at moments, be a mensch.\n\nBut Chase, as Mike Ovtiz explains quite accurately, didn’t run his career in a logical fashion. He was sublime in “Caddyshack,” but he didn’t make good on his leading-man promise. The “Vacation” films saved him, of course, and he was vintage Chevy in them, but by the mid-’80s his shtick had begun to lose its surprise. You could feel that in “Deal of the Century” and “Three Amigos!” and “Spies Like Us,” where the Chase mystique was running on fumes. Even after his career wound down, he never stopped popping up in movies, though by the late ’90s and 2000s none of his supporting turns could match the comic drama of his contentious appearances on “The Howard Stern Show.”\n\n“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” devotes its second half to Chase’s troubled childhood, and to how he cleaned himself up after too many years in the drug wilderness, and also to the extraordinary war zone that “Community,” the NBC sitcom that revived his career, became. The young cast of “Community” resented his entitlement; he was 66 years old and still irascible. And when the tension exploded in Chase using the N-word on set, as he was trying to explain how he would use it with Richard Pryor on “SNL” (the doc includes their famous racial-epithet sketch, perhaps the ultimate example of you-could-never-do-that-today), the series became a meltdown. After all of this, is Chevy Chase chastened? Yes and no. You can see that he knows he sometimes went too far, yet during the 50th anniversary show of “Saturday Night Live,” when he was not invited to perform, even for one moment, that was basically the entertainment industry blackballing him for 50 years of snark-fueled transgression. He admits on camera how much it hurt. You could say, in that way, that he has paid his dues. He’s still Chevy Chase, but by the end of this movie you’re almost grateful you’re not.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:40:06 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T17:03:06.877280"}

He won best director honors at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards and BAFTAs. [&#8230;]", "content": "Ben Affleck appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” amid his press tour for Netflix’s “The Rip” and looked back on the “massive embarrassment” of being snubbed at the Oscars for best director with “Argo.” Affleck was a frontrunner to land a nom. He won best director honors at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards and BAFTAs. Alas, Affleck was snubbed while “Argo” went on to earn seven Oscar nominations and win best picture and two other prizes.\n\n“It was the year, the horrible thing of everyone telling you, ‘You’re gonna get nominated, you’re gonna get nominated for director,’” Affleck remembered. “And so, of course, I wake up that morning, and sure enough — and, by the way, it’s not [unlike] any other morning that I had not been nominated for best director. But all of a sudden, it’s a massive embarrassment. I woke up and people [said], ‘You didn’t get nominated.’”\n\nAffleck’s story reminded Kimmel of being at the Critics Choice Awards the night prior, where “Once Battle After Another” picked up major honors for best picture, director and adapted screenplay but left leading man Leonardo DiCaprio shut out for best actor (which went to Timothee Chalamet for “Marty Supreme”).\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I was thinking, boy, he’s got so many better places to be,” Kimmel quipped about DiCaprio. “And the movie wins best picture. The director Paul Thomas Anderson wins best director, and then he doesn’t win. And I’m thinking he must be so pissed that [he had to leave] whatever he got airlifted from — a yacht somewhere — and couldn’t be there anymore. He came to lose.”\n\n“This is maybe the worst award-show situation ever,” Kimmel continued. “I think you’re underselling this. Because ‘Argo,’ not only was it nominated for the Oscar for best picture, you won best picture. You starred in it and directed it, and you were not nominated in either category … it’s as if the movie directed itself.”\n\n“That’s sort of what it felt like,” Affleck replied. “The day of the snub, which all of a sudden it’s a negative event and a horrible thing, I had to go to the Critics Choice Awards. I remember getting there and there’s a red carpet line, like 500 people dying to talk to me, and every single one of them was like, ‘Hi! So the snub…’ What do you say to that? ‘It’s a bummer!’ I did end up winning the Critics Choice Award.”\n\n“Honestly, it’s just embarrassing,” Affleck added. “I wasn’t the one going out there being like, “I’m going to be nominated!’ It’s having to be put through the ritual of then answering for why you didn’t get nominated. I didn’t say I was [going to be]!”\n\nSomeone who can relate to what Affleck is talking about is Bradley Cooper, who was similarly snubbed for best director with “A Star Is Born” despite landing nominations from the Golden Globes, Critics’ Choice Awards and Directors Guild of America. Cooper also said the snub was “embarrassing.”\n\n“The first thing I felt was embarrassment, actually. Think about it. I felt embarrassed that I didn’t do my part,” Cooper told Oprah in 2019. “Even if I got the nomination, it should not give me any sense of whether I did my job or not. That’s the trick, to make something that you believe in.”\n\nCooper explained that did not set out to make a movie that landed Academy Award nominations, adding: “The only thing I set out to do was to tap into as an authentic place as possible. [An authentic place] in myself and everybody I asked to make this movie — to tell a human story of people who are going to deal with their family life, trauma as a child, addiction in a real way, love in this life and finding your voice.”\n\nWatch Affleck’s full interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in the video below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:34:14 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T18:44:08.311577"}

Westlake’s 1997 novel The Ax, had its world premiere in the main competition at the 82nd Venice Film Festival. The film garnered significant critical attention, receiving a nine-minute standing ovation on the Lido and later going on to win the inaugural International People’s Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival. It has since been selected as South Korea’s entry for the Best International Feature Film at this year’s Oscars.\n\nNeon landed No Other Choice ahead of its festival run and released it in the U.S. on December 25, grossing $22.6 million to date. It has picked up Golden Globes nominations for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy and Non-English Language as well as a nom for star Byung-hun Lee. It also scored a Best Pic nom from the Gotham Awards and a Foreign Language nom from Critics Choice. Critics Choice and the Gothams also nominated the adapted screenplay credited to Park, Lee Kyoung-mi, Jahye Lee and Don McKellar.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSet in Busan, South Korea, the script immediately establishes the perfect, albeit precarious, domestic world of Yoo Man-soo (Lee) and his proud wife, Lee Mi-ri (Son Ye-jin), and their two children. The film opens with a deceptively serene scene: Yoo is happily barbecuing an eel, a supposed gift for his hard work at the factory — unaware that it is, in fact, a severance gift.\n\nYoo, an award-winning paper factory manager, is abruptly laid off with his colleagues, marking the beginning of his devastating decline. In a moment of false bravado at a group counseling session, the once-proud father declares an optimistic, yet fatally flawed, “In three months, I’ll get hired again! I feel great!” This declaration is a key turning point, setting into motion the dangerous and morally corrupt oath he takes to reclaim his respect and status as a provider.\n\nThe screenplay efficiently charts Yoo’s humiliating and accelerating financial ruin. Months later, he’s reduced to working at a grocery store. A prospective job interview — one where he fails to answer the seemingly innocuous question, “What is your weakness” — underscores his deep-seated inability to adapt or self-reflect. The material challenges pile up: escalating mortgage bills, downgrading their car, a persistent toothache that mirrors his internal rot, and the devastating notice of an impending foreclosure on his childhood home.\n\nIn desperation, Yoo hatches a chilling yet darkly logical plan. He posts a job advertisement for a fictitious paper company to solicit résumés from his former colleagues and industry rivals. He then systematically targets and murders the qualified candidates, attempting to destroy the competition and increase his own negligible chance of re-employment.\n\nThe script’s sharpest focus is on the theme of identity and masculine pride of unemployed men who view working in “lesser” roles as beneath them, contrasting sharply with the stress and practical sacrifices endured by their wives and families. Yoo is a perfect vehicle for this satire, as his ultimate act of violence is driven not by necessity but rather a pathological need to maintain an image of success.\n\nThe film’s title is derived from a key scene where Yoo uses the tapping method (a coping technique taught in his counseling sessions), repeating the phrase “no other choice” as a warped mantra before committing one of his calculated murders. This brilliantly encapsulates the dark irony: his actions are not a last resort but a grotesque consequence of his own inability to accept reality or compromise his ego.\n\nPark was fascinated by the novel’s core psychological mechanism: the process by which an “ordinary person who was perfectly normal, ends up like this in a social system.” He notes that the victims Yoo targets are essentially his alter egos — men facing the same existential crisis. He highlights the irony that Yoo doesn’t target the company or the capitalist system that wronged him, but instead goes for those who are equally as pitiful as he is.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:11:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T19:27:20.001108"}

Both unsettling and tender is Franz Böhm’s BAFTA-winning short film Rock, Paper, Scissors, which follows the true story of Ivan (Oleksandr Rudynskyi) as he helps his father (Sergey Kalantay) run a makeshift hospital near the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine war. When Russian aircraft carrier bombs thwart their plans to seek a more undisturbed area, Russian soldiers start to seek out their bunker. To keep the most vulnerable safe, Ivan has to decide to confront the soldiers or deceive them at the potential cost of his life.\n\nThe 20-minute short film, produced by Hayder Rothschild Hoozeer and backed by the National Film and Television School, in addition to winning Best Student Film and the Best Short Film Grand Prize at HollyShorts London, has also landed the 2026 Oscars shortlist.\n\nBelow, Hoozeer and Böhm talk to Deadline about the emotional vulnerabilities and dangers of war.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDEADLINE: How did your meeting with Ivan inform Rock, Paper, Scissors?\n\nFRANZ BÖHM: I met Ivan during his time in the U.K. We met by coincidence and created a wonderful friendship. At some point, I asked about a scar he had on his leg, and he told me this incredible story about the impossible decisions he had to make during the war [in Ukraine]. I was very impressed by his moral courage and bravery, and very impressed by how, over the span of a day, he was forced to grow up and lose any sense of teenage freedom he might’ve had. He volunteered afterwards to serve in the Ukrainian military, but we were able to write a screenplay together, and I also got his advice on location scouting. It was a wonderful collaboration.\n\nRock, Paper, Scissors National Film and Television School\n\nDEADLINE: Oleksandr Rudynskyi plays Ivan. Talk about that collaboration between you two.\n\nBÖHM: Collaborating with Oleksandr was an enormous honor and pleasure. He’s incredibly talented, experienced and a wonderful actor. We worked really hard to get him in Ukraine; he is a very well-known actor, and when Ivan learned that Oleksandr was going to play him, that was a huge surprise.\n\nHAYDER HOOZEER: I think it’s also worth mentioning that during the time of the production itself, when we were shooting the film and even pre-production, the real Ivan was in Ukraine at the frontline. So, the events the story is telling you are happening in real time for many other Ukrainians. Even up until this point, the conflict is still ongoing at the frontline in Ukraine. Ivan also passed before seeing the complete version of this film. We had an alternative ending that we had intended to do, but I’m sure people will understand this: you never really meet someone knowing that they are going to die [relatively soon].\n\nThat’s the weight we’ve carried throughout everything to this point: Ivan was alive whilst we were making this film, and then he was killed. There isn’t anything that prepares you for that reality, especially in filmmaking. When he passed, we cut out parts of that other ending because ethically and morally it didn’t feel right to continue his story in the direction that we were going to do as a result of honoring his death.\n\nDEADLINE: Because this situation is still ongoing, was there fear in covering this topic?\n\nHOOZEER: Well, we now have the support from the Office of the President of Ukraine – I had gone over to Ukraine during active bombardment twice in 2025. What was so heartbreaking and inspiring was the quiet bravery and resilience of the people in Ukraine. It was really important for us to ensure this story was as authentic as possible and was supported by that community. We brought over Ukrainian actors from Germany. We worked with the Ministry of Culture to bring over Oleksandr to be able to shoot in the U.K., and even that had its own level of complications because as soon as he arrived, his best friend was killed in Ukraine. Franz and I had a conversation about how we should postpone the shoot because his family and friends were far more important than the film we were making. We spoke to Oleksandr about this, but he said he felt a stronger drive to portray Ivan in this film because he understood the mission we were trying to achieve.\n\nAs filmmakers, we understand the impact of storytelling; we understand that through the power of filmmaking, we can help people connect with different themes and realities affecting people far away and, subsequently, those who are really close.\n\nBÖHM: Our team and our cast members transformed fear into urgency. We had a high level of commitment to authenticity across all disciplines, sound design, music, production design and the performances themselves. Many thoughts went into every detail of this film.\n\nDEADLINE: Why was the handheld camera style the most effective way to tell this story for you?\n\nBÖHM: We had the real pleasure of working with an extremely talented and international head of departments on this project. And we had enough time to prepare for the shoot and to figure out the audiovisual language and the overall design of the project. This was done through extensive testing, location scouting, and meetings. We also watched a lot of films [for inspiration]. So, the choice to use the handheld style was a result of those meetings. We wanted to deploy that specific style because the audience is never smarter than Ivan, our main character, and we wanted to be as close to him as possible throughout the whole film. We incorporated that into the score and sound design as well to resemble what Ivan is feeling during certain moments. For example, the moment when he shoots himself in the leg, you’re getting [to see] this incredible pain, and oftentimes [when] people have [severe injuries] like this, there’s a lot of difficulty [in trying to communicate] because all you can hear is your blood pumping through your veins so loudly. So, we tried to recreate that with both the sound design and score.\n\nDEADLINE: Talk about the importance of the title Rock, Paper, Scissors. Why did this fit the story you are telling?\n\nHOOZEER: There are a couple of reasons why the title is important. Rock, Paper, Scissors is fundamentally a children’s game. There’s an innocence to it. It’s the idea that, over the course of this film, the reality mirrors how we see Ivan lose his innocence. The game also mirrors war in the sense that there aren’t really any real winners, just like there are no real winners in Rock, Paper, Scissors. With the film focusing on the civilian point of view, when Ivan is out in the world, we can hear those jets flying over. But in that situation, you don’t know if they’re friendly or if they’re foes. This could be the last time you step outside. Survival in war is a game of luck and a game of chance. And it really felt like, especially with the story of Ivan itself, almost a coming-of-age story for Ivan. It’s a war thriller.\n\nBÖHM: The film is not really about war in the first place. It’s about people and how they react and have to behave when the systems around them, created to protect them, just collapse. And I think that’s what Rock, Paper, Scissors is trying to tell through Ivan’s harrowing, brutal story.\n\nDEADLINE: You’ve won the BAFTA and scooped up awards from various international festivals and now have landed the Oscars shortlist. As a producer, what have you noticed about the different reactions to the regions that you’ve played this in?\n\nHOOZEER: This story humanizes the realities of war. Globally, we’ve had quite a successful festival run. We’ve had the film show in New Zealand, LA, across the U.S., the U.K., in Europe, even in Africa and Mauritius. We’ve had quite a lot of international response to the film, and I think it’s less about the glorification of heroism. The character is not a Hollywood hero. The idea is that he’s a civilian, he’s a human. I think the film explores choices made under pressure, the drive to save everyone without leaving anyone behind, the risk for the greater good, resilience when everything crumbles and the steadfast defense of what we hold dear. These themes unfold with deliberate intensity, and that’s been universal everywhere we’ve taken this film.\n\nRock, Paper, Scissors National Film and Television School\n\nDEADLINE: Franz, you’re still in your mid-20s. Between this and your previous documentary, Dear Future Children, there seems to be a desire to tell stories about people living under oppressive regimes. Don’t you just want to be a guy in his 20s? These are some complex topics.\n\nBÖHM: My connection to film was created when I was still quite young. I lost my father when I was 11, and that was a very difficult time for my mother and I. During that time, I found a personal escape in watching films, especially adventurous ones set in other countries or those in which the lead characters had to transform themselves. I remember being quite young and getting fascinated when I researched what all the different credits on a film meant, like what a DoP or a producer does.\n\nI was a 14-year-old living in South Germany when I stepped onto my first film set as a runner and immediately fell in love with the process of making films, which, to this day, I think is deeply magical and amazing. I know I have experienced it firsthand how much films can help people. Obviously, when I say ‘help people,’ it sounds like a simple phrase, but I think it means helping people understand one another. Film helps us understand a subjective experience that somebody else might have. For example, in Germany, it helped understand the devastation of the Holocaust and all its different factions and the consequences massively.\n\nCinema often helps us zoom in on a conflict, tragedy, or even a positive moment in a particular story, experience, or character to share the value of that experience. That’s what cinema is about to me. I’m very grateful that, as a young boy with no prior connection to the industry – I have no family members who work in the media industry – I was able to get into the industry this way. I’m grateful for the many collaborators I’ve had on this journey, and I’m looking forward to many more that I’ll hopefully meet in the future. I’m grateful I was able to study at the National Film and Television School, a place that was always a dream for me. I was able to meet so many incredible fellow students, many of whom helped me create Rock, Paper, Scissors. And in today’s world, there are so many conflicts brewing alongside new political movements and emerging problems. If you look at cinema over the last few years, I would say films have done an excellent job of helping us as a society debate these problems, and that’s what I’m really excited and passionate about.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:50:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T19:57:00.082143"}

I’m going to kill myself,” Kristen Stewart says, ribbing her longtime friend Jesse Eisenberg for watching her directorial debut, “The Chronology of Water,” on his laptop.\n\nThe “Twilight” star, who earned an Oscar nomination for portraying Princess Diana in “Spencer,” vowed to quit acting until she could adapt Lidia Yuknavitch’s 2011 stream-of-conscious memoir about a young woman (played by Imogen Poots), sexually abused as a child, who eventually finds her voice through writing and swimming. Stewart didn’t labor for nearly a decade to secure the film’s financing only for someone to see her passion project on a computer screen.\n\n“It’s supposed to be a sonic experience,” she sighs and keeps roasting Eisenberg. “You know about movies? Have you ever made a movie?”\n\nStewart and Eisenberg met on 2009’s coming-of-age comedy “Adventureland” and reunited on 2015’s stoner adventure “American Ultra” and Woody Allen’s 2016 romantic drama “Cafe Society.” Since then, Eisenberg has directed two films, 2022’s dramedy “When You Finish Saving the World” and 2024’s Oscar-nominated “A Real Pain.” So yeah, he knows something about making movies, as well as a director’s desire for audiences to see them on the big screen.\n\n“I’m aware of that and was taking all of that into account,” Eisenberg wryly retorts before complimenting his pal. “I was astounded. I’ve never seen something made like this by someone I know who is also funny.”\n\nStewart and Eisenberg continue to tease each other during their conversation, in which they discuss how directing has changed their perspective as actors and whether they care if their films make money.\n\nJesse Eisenberg: Are you OK?\n\nKristen Stewart: That should be the intro: “Are you OK?” I’m not kidding. That’s often how we greet each other.\n\nEisenberg: We’ve known each other for a long time — 15 years, right?\n\nStewart: I was 17 when we met. I’m 35.\n\nEisenberg: Oh my God, really? I saw your movie 24 hours ago. I was blown away. My first thought was “We can do that? I didn’t know we could do that.” It’s unbelievably audacious. You read this book, but how did you convey it to other people? (I know these are junket questions.) What does the script look like?\n\nStewart: You and I are fairly shy people, but there’s an innate, stifling invisibility that women have to grapple with, even if they weren’t abused by their father. I didn’t want to make statements, like, “This is what the movie’s about.” There was just something about the book that spoke to the universality of being a young girl trying to excavate a voice that’s been told to shut up.\n\nEisenberg: You and I have the advantage of being known actors. It allows, or maybe gives, us the responsibility to make something that’s harder to convey. Is that part of the reason you were able to do something so abstract? The result is astounding, but that’s not guaranteed.\n\nBenedict Evans for Variety\n\nStewart: It wasn’t easy for me to make the movie. It took eight years. People that love me were genuinely sick and tired of hearing me be so upset about it. And then those things are baked into the plot of the movie. It’s about the malleability of our realities. I had to continuously remind people that we were doing a poem.\n\nEisenberg: What I was asking before, if I can ask it better, is —\n\nStewart: I can answer it better.\n\nEisenberg: This is my question: Did you feel a responsibility to make something unusual because you’re a well-known actor, or is this just entirely your taste?\n\nStewart: This is entirely my taste. I could never make something straightforward. I like associative, open-ended things that say something very particular but invite people to disagree.\n\nEisenberg: How did your taste develop?\n\nStewart: I don’t like being told what to do. I don’t want to tell people what to do.\n\nEisenberg: I read something you said, which I thought was funny and reminded me of myself. Somebody asked you, “Do you think of being an actor in a movie differently now?” You’re like, “Of course. I’ll go to the director and say, ‘I’ll do whatever you want me to do.’”\n\nStewart: I’ll never question anything again. I’m like, “Anything you want.” The idea of being like, “You should cast this person.” I’m like, “Excuse me? You don’t know anything.”\n\nEisenberg: Isn’t that fascinating? A lot of people in our position go the other way. They feel even more like they need control because they have an experience where they were controlling everything. The story I always tell about you — because I’ve been asked about you for 18 years — is when we were doing “Adventureland,” there was a dramatic scene at night, and you were like, “Cut. I’m lying.” You were 17, and I was shocked. I felt like I was watching a master. Would you have done that now?\n\nStewart: I get mad at people now for cutting, because I’m like, “I know you questioned yourself, but that moment of question was gold.” I want to try and not do that. [As an actor] I don’t want to be misinterpreted. When a director is like, “It seemed like you were feeling it.” I always say, “I don’t care if it looks good; I want to do it again.” I’m selfish. I want to taste it.\n\nBenedict Evans for Variety\n\nEisenberg: “I want the catharsis.” One of the other stories I tell from “Adventureland” was a quick scene. I had my first panic attack on set; I was self-aware in the worst way, and I shut down. After the tape, I was mortified. Greg [Mottola, the director] goes, “I didn’t notice, but I’m so sorry you felt that way.” He said, “I don’t understand how actors aren’t having panic attacks all the time. You’re in front of strangers, and you have to be vulnerable.” For years, I remember thinking, “It’s a sweet thing he said, but he’s pitying actors too much. We’re lucky. We have an easy job. We memorize lines.”\n\nNow I have respect for the job in a way I never did personally. Because I was so self-critical, I couldn’t have a good feeling about it. It seemed like, “You’re overpaying me.” Then Julianne Moore was in my movie, and after her first scene, I turned to my producer and was like, “Can we pay her more?” Did you have that feeling with Imogen? I’ve done three movies with her. But not in the same way I’ve done three movies with you. How did you choose her?\n\nStewart: You’re one of the reasons. I was like, “I’m sure we would be close because you guys are friends.” She did an audition. She sent a tape and I was like, “Oh my God.” There’s something about her being 35 and me being 35. We should have been friends since we were younger. We just never met. Then we did, and it was the perfect time to go, “We need to shove everything we’ve never said to each other into this movie.”\n\nEisenberg: Do you feel you could have this style and use it going forward?\n\nStewart: I’m always asked if I would continue to work as an actor in studio films, or if feels like you’re selling a homogenized idea that doesn’t land on an individual, necessarily, but satisfies a group? I wouldn’t be good at that job.\n\nEisenberg What do you mean? To direct a more commercial thing?\n\nStewart: More and more, commercial means standard and digestible. I want to be allowed to make movies that allow for time to figure out a structure and mission statement. The next movie I want to make utilizes different formats. Not because it’s nerdy film stuff, but because it’s more interesting to make movies about how you see something instead of what you see.\n\nEisenberg: Your movie is coming out soon. Do you think or care about it making money?\n\nStewart: It would be great if it did because then maybe it wouldn’t be as difficult to make my next movie. But at the same time, the next movie I want to make functions outside of the business structure we’re used to. People love to hear that.\n\nEisenberg: “This doesn’t even exist in your structure.”\n\nStewart: Well, it doesn’t. You need to find new terms for all of this because, I’m sorry, but the language and structure are oppressive.\n\nEisenberg: There’s no English on this set. It doesn’t apply to what we’re doing.\n\nStewart: Actually, the title of the movie is in Spanish. I’m not going to tell you what it is.\n\nEisenberg: I wouldn’t understand it.\n\nStewart: Yeah, you’re just a dummy.\n\nEisenberg: So you care insofar as it helps you make the next one. You care insofar as it pays the people back who paid for it. But you’re not caring about what other people might think about it? People ask me too. I guess I don’t care about it being a successful business thing. My mind doesn’t go there, or I can’t conceive of it.\n\nStewart: For sure. I love the movie. I birthed it. I probably would have made this movie if I was never an actor. I didn’t feel like I was graduating into like, “Now I want to check that box.” I think this thing needs to exist.\n\nEisenberg: We’re directing everything, but we’re also desperate actors. So all I’ll say is this: I can learn Spanish for your next project.\n\nStewart: You need to put yourself on tape.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T20:33:54.041487"}

Netflix compiles its all-time list by counting views across each title’s first 91 days of viewing; for batched releases like “Stranger Things,” views are counted through each volume’s first 91 days. As such, because Volume 1 of “Stranger Things” Season 5 debuted on Nov. 26, those four episodes will continue to accrue chart viewership through Feb. 24, while Volume 2’s three episodes will be counted from Dec. 25 to March 25 and finale viewership will count from Dec. 31 to March 31.\n\nTherefore, “Stranger Things” Season 5 has three months to continue climbing higher on the all-time chart. With its current spot as No. 9, it knocked “Fool Me Once” off the chart and surpassed Season 1 of “The Night Agent.” Season 4 of “Stranger Things,” which was released in 2022, remains No. 3 on the chart to this day (140.7 million), outranked only by “Wednesday” Season 1 (252.1 million views) and “Adolescence” (142.6 million). Given that “Stranger Things” Season 5 achieved with Netflix’s biggest-ever opening for an English-language series with 59.6 million views, it seems possible that the sci-fi series’ final entry could make it to No. 1.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nNaturally, “Stranger Things” Season 5 was the most-watched title of the week Dec. 29-Jan. 4, during with the finale was available for five days, hitting 31.5 million views overall. While Netflix did not provide a viewership total for the finale alone, it should be noted that the weekly total would have been even higher if not for Netflix’s decision to concurrently debut the finale in movie theaters, where it earned more than $25 million.\n\nAdditionally, all previous seasons of “Stranger Things” continued to chart for the sixth week in a row: Season 1 ranked at No. 3 with 7.6 million views, Season 2 was No. 5 with 5.5 million, Season 3 was No. 7 with 5 million and Season 4 was No. 8 with 4.8 million.\n\nBesides “Stranger Things,” the Netflix Top 10 for Dec. 29-Jan. 4 featured Harlan Coben’s “Run Away,” which debuted at No. 2 with 12.7 million views in its first four days of availability.

Season 5 continues that trend as the multi-dimensional Carson family tackles topics including scars left by absent parents, scars created by present parents, and following your dreams through all of it. BET+ touts Season 5 as the show’s “wildest, most uproarious season yet,” as the Carsons discover that the only constant is change.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nGuest stars in Season 5 include Raven-Symoné, Tisha Campbell, Tristan “Mack” Wilds, Omeretta, Sandra Caldwell, Loretta Devine, and the vocal trio SWV. Campbell, Raven-Symoné, and Devine’s roles are teased in the trailer above. It’s also worth noting the return of series co-creator Jordan E. Cooper, who will reprise his role of Sadiq Shay.\n\nMore about the first trio of shows dropping tomorrow below.\n\nRaven Symoné, Briyana Guadalupe (front) and J. Bernard Calloway in Episode 501\n\nEpisode 501 “Killin’ and Dyin’”: It becomes clear that Pat (Williams-Lee) is doing too much when she faints and is ordered to rest, but there is no rest for Pat as she’s determined to perform at a big comedy show with a big star (Raven Symoné). She enlists Junebug (Theodore John Barnes) to cover for her, but at what cost?\n\nBrittany Inge as Ashley and Vince Swann as Brandon, whose natural father’s ashes are lost in Episode 502\n\nEpisode 502 “Wild Goose Chase”: The family has a yard sale to clear out the junk in the house, but when Lloyd’s ashes and last words are lost and a very personal video to Pat and Terry (J. Bernard Calloway) is accidentally sold, the pressure is on to get them back, at any cost.\n\nJ. Bernard Calloway, Pat “Ms. Pat’ Williams-Lee and Theodore John Barnes in Episode 503 BET+\n\nEpisode 503 “License and Registration?”: Janelle (Briyana Guadalupe) is stressed over Pat messing up her college course registration and Terry being an overprotective Dad, but it’s Junebug who will need to be protected after he steals and crashes a certain someone’s car.\n\nThe series also stars Tami Roman, who returns as Pat’s sister Denise. In the trailer, it looks like Denise has a new romantic interest, and this time, he’s not a white guy.\n\nThe Ms. Pat Show is created by Williams-Lee and Cooper, who also serve as executive producers alongside Rose-Catherine Pinkney, Lee Daniels, Brian Grazer, Deb Evans, Patrick Walsh, Jon Radler, Natalie Berkus, and Mary Lou Belli, with Walsh also acting as creative producer. Allison Bosma and Jon DeWalt serve as co-executive producers.\n\nThe writing team includes Walsh, Bosma, DeWalt, Desia Gore, Garrianna P. Lee, and Vincent B. Bryant Jr., with Mary Lou Belli and Cooper directing this season.

Because of the complex split season methodology, there is no way to verify the views Netflix puts up for Stranger Things 5 on the Most Popular list where Stranger Things 4 — another split-season entry — is currently at No.3.\n\nA very simplistic calculation based on publicly released viewership information, which factors in four episodes for the first four weeks of Stranger Things 5 release, seven for Week 5 and eight for Week 6, delivers an in-the-ballpark but inflated by overcounting season average of 119M views to date.

Directed and written by Scott Cooper based on a book by Warren Zanes, the micro-biopic chronicles the making of Bruce Springsteen’s 1982 acoustic album Nebraska.\n\nSet in autumn 1981, the story follows a 31-year-old Springsteen, who despite the massive success of his previous album The River and its subsequent tour, finds himself at one of the lowest points in his life. Instead of returning to the studio to record more hits as his label executives expected, Springsteen retreated to a quiet house in Colts Neck, NJ, to rest. During this period of isolation and burgeoning depression, he used a simple 4-track cassette recorder to self-record the 10 raw, haunted songs that would become Nebraska. The film is a character-driven drama that explores the man behind “The Boss” icon, staring inward at a personal and creative crossroads.\n\n20th Century scooped up rights to finance and release the pic back in April 2024 with Jeremy Allen White aboard to star. The film world premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and hit theaters at the end of October. It has grossed $45.2 million at the global box office, and White has been nominated for a Golden Globe for his portrayal.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nCentral to Deliver Me From Nowhere is an exploration of isolation and the healing power of music. The story show Springsteen’s retreat from the world not just as a creative choice, but also as a response to a period of burgeoning depression and loneliness. Cooper and White described the film as the story of a “neglected soul” repairing himself through music, suggesting that the recording of Nebraska was an unplanned necessity born from a deep-seated need to confront unresolved trauma. This internal struggle is portrayed with raw honesty, focusing on the darker, mournful corners of humanity that inspired the record’s lyrics.\n\nThis internal journey is deeply tied to the ghosts of Springsteen’s past, particularly his complex relationship with his father, Doug Springsteen. The film examines how the elder Springsteen’s struggles with mental health and alcoholism spiritually haunted Bruce, influencing his perspective and his own battles with depression. These family dynamics are intertwined with a fear of success; the narrative depicts Springsteen worrying that his rising stardom might distance him from the working-class identity of his youth in Freehold, NJ.\n\nThe filmmakers emphasize a commitment to authenticity over mythology, choosing to strip away the rock-star icon to find the person underneath. This focus on the intimate details of the creative process highlights the burden of artistic vision, showing Springsteen’s persistence in honoring a somber, non-commercial direction even when it defied the expectations of label executives. Ultimately, the film is presented as a study of an artist’s quest for truth during a time of quiet, internal unraveling.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T21:27:16.858861"}

I think they teeter that line very well, because I’ve already noticed a kind of 50/50 split amongst fans about whether they believe.”\n\nHwoever, Matarazzo did have this to say about Eleven’s ending: “What’s so tragic about the end of Eleven’s story is normalcy would never be guaranteed for the people that she loves if she was there. She didn’t see it as fair, and I think it was a beautiful choice to end her story the way that they did.”\n\n“Stranger Things” co-creator previously told Variety there was no version of the show’s ending where “Eleven was never going to be there” with her friends at the end.\n\n“It was very early on in the writing process of this season that we figured out exactly how to tell that story and landed on the ‘I believe’ moment,” referring to one of the show’s final moments where the main characters choose to believe Mike’s story about Eleven’s survival. “Once we landed on ‘I believe,’ then that sort of cracked it wide open. That was in those first few weeks of the writers’ room, because we started at the end, at that basement scene, and wanted to make sure that we got it to a place where we felt was the right ending for the show.

The throwdown came after Trump mocked Newsom in a rambling speech at the Kennedy Center by the incumbant to Republican lawmakers.\n\nLacking any sense of irony, Trump bet that Newsom, who he has anointed as the Democrats’ 2028 White Hosue frontrunner even though the outgoing governor has yet to formally declare his bid, couldn’t pass a cognitive test. “We should give everybody these competency tests …I think every president and vice president should be forced to take cognitive exams,” POTUS said at one point in his 84-minute remarks today.\n\nTaking swipes at ex-VP nominee Gov Tim Walz (D-MN) and ex-VP Kamala Harris (as well as telling his congressional minions he’ll be impeached if the Dems win the midterms), Trump kept going. “I don’t think Gavin could,” POTUS said of the Golden State governor passing a cognitive test. “He’s got a good line of crap, but other than that he couldn’t pass.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFollowing his rapid response M.O. honed over the last year, Newsom swung back from the official California Governor’s X feed.\n\nIn homage to Trump’s odd 2020 boast of nailing a sequence of words in a previous cognitive test, Newsom wrote: “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” The Governor added: “If you’re so confident, let’s do it. Name your time and place.”\n\nPerson. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.@realDonaldTrump, if you're so confident, let's do it. Name your time and place. https://t.co/SNHHzKdwiu — Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) January 6, 2026\n\nThe White House has not responded to Deadline’s request for comment on Gov. Newsom’s reaction.\n\nHowever, Tuesday also found Trump announcing online, in caps and with his Newscum put down, that the “Fraud Investigation of California has begun.”\n\nWhat that probe is, who is conducting it (DOJ) or what it is about is unknown presently. If the White House is hoping to kneecap Newsom, who is term limited and has to leave office next year, the way they did Minnesota’s Walz, they might have another thing coming.\n\nUnlike Walz, who dropped his race for a third term on Monday after revelations of a sprawling state Medicaid fraud scandal engulfed the would-be VP, the 58-year-old Newsom has played offense much more than defense against the MAGA administration since Trump returned to power on January 20, 2025. Which is why, Newsom’s team reply to the corruption post was that POTUS is a “deranged, habitual liar whose relationship with reality ended years ago,” shouldn’t come as any surprise.\n\nEven as a wave of potential successors line up among California Democrats and Republicans heading towards the June 2 statewide primary date and then November’s midterms, Newsom isn’t going quietly during his remaining months in office.\n\nAfter a year of wildfires, relief funding battles, ICE raids, protests, troops in the streets and court cases, plus partisan redistricting, a slew of punishing funding cuts from DC and a new anti-mask law, the ambitious governor is scheduled to deliver his final state of the State of January 8 in Sacramento.

But the joy is short-lived as Deborah and her head writer Ava (Einbinder) soon find themselves compromising their integrity in different ways due to the network’s demands. Things come to a head in the May 22 episode “A Slippery Slope,” when Deborah is ordered to fire Ava. Rather than comply, Deborah shocks everyone by telling the audience the truth and loses her show.\n\n\n\nTwo months later, it was announced that CBS would not be renewing “The Late Show,” with speculation widespread that the choice was due to the host’s outspoken criticism of President Donald Trump. Two months later, fellow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s show was abruptly suspended after he addressed the shooting of Charlie Kirk in his monologue. FCC chair Brendan Carr had threatened to pull ABC affiliate broadcast licenses and soon station groups Nexstar and Sinclair announced they would not air the show. Kimmel returned to the air days later, due in part to a massive public outcry.\n\nThe “Hacks” scenes were filmed at least a half year prior to the Colbert announcement, and Einbinder does say it was strange to see it unfold. “I think it was like, holy shit, this is really crazy and also spooky that it was specifically late night and specifically that type of censorship,” she noted. “It’s so bizarre.”\n\nHowever, she added, in some ways, it was not unexpected. “Kind of observing the way that things have been going for quite some time, I didn’t find what happened to Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel to be a shock at all because of all the censorship that we’ve seen. Academics, journalists, students, have been fired or expelled, or, in some cases locked up for expressing their speech. So, watching that transpire in was in no way a surprise to me, unfortunately.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nEinbinder went on to praise show creators Paul W. Downs, Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky for how the story was addressed and worked into the show organically. “I’m really proud of Paul, Lucia and Jen for handling that issue and for speaking on that and for doing it in a way that is beautiful and also earned within the narrative,” she revealed. “It’s not like forcing anything down anybody’s throat. It’s really justified and grounded in reality, as we know.”\n\nEinbinder also hinted that in the upcoming season they are “similarly facing certain issues of the day, and it just makes me really proud.”\n\nEinbinder also discussed how “Hacks” was her first acting job after started her career as a stand-up. She reiterated her love for the medium, but did admit there were some bumpy times. “I’ve felt pain, I have done it all,” she said. “I have been booed at a fucking saloon in rural Washington during a goddamn pool tournament. I’ve been at a goddamn motherfucking Holiday Inn Express in Laramie, Wyo., on Valentine’s Day, just fucking looking at the cottage cheese ceiling being like, ‘I should go back to my barista job. This is a mistake.’”\n\nBut when told stand-up comedy takes bravery, she responded, “I don’t know if it’s brave. I think it is a desperate act for desperate people — but I love it. I love the art form. It is so awesome and so pure and there. There’s nothing like being in a room with people and like sharing that.”\n\nWatch Einbinder’s SAG-AFTRA Foundation Conversation below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:18:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T22:27:53.696471"}

Once she arrived at the festival, though, she was asked to meet with actor Paul Mescal. It was a moment of kismet.\n\n“Just looking at him, I saw a young Shakespeare. He had an earring,” Zhao told Variety’s Angelique Jackson, who moderated both conversations. “I just said to him, ‘Have you ever thought about playing young William Shakespeare?’ and he said, ‘Well, if you’re talking about “Hamnet…” Because I love the book. You have to read the book. It is perfect for you. It’s not what you think it is.’”\n\nZhao took Mescal’s advice and read O’Farrell’s 2020 novel, which tells a mostly fictional story about how the death of William and Agnes’ son Hamnet inspired the Bard to write “Hamlet.” When Zhao read it, she immediately thought of Jesse Buckley for Agnes. “All I saw was Jesse,” the filmmaker recalled. “It was very tunnel vision.”\n\nCasting Buckley proved fruitful not just for her committed performance but for her contributions to the production as a whole. Zhao explained that the actress helped her and O’Farrell rewrite the ending. While the novel ends with the emphatic line “Remember me,” and the initial script concluded with Hamlet dying on stage during the play’s debut performance at the Globe Theatre, the film added an emotional final scene of Agnes and the Globe’s crowd reaching out towards the actor in a moment of collective grief and empathy.\n\n“Jesse sent me Max Richter’s ‘This Bitter Earth,’ which is a lyrics version of ‘On the Nature of Daylight,’” Zhao recalled. “I was listening to the song in the car, and I started to cry. I felt tightness in my heart, but also opening. And then I started reaching out to the window. I was trying to touch the rain outside.” Zhao was going through a personal loss at the time, she explained. “But this gesture, I realized, I was trying to reach for something bigger that I could be a part of, so that I would have the strength to let go. And then I realized that’s what Hamlet needed.”\n\n“Hamnet” filmmaker Chloé Zhao poses with Kering Americas president Ewa Abrams at the 37th annual Palm Springs International Film Festival. Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Palm Springs International Film Society\n\nThat collaborative spirit and emotional intuition are indicative of why Amblin wanted Zhao to direct “Hamnet” in the first place. Zhao jokes that empathy has always been a part of her nature, and that she can now prove to her parents that the “oversensitive child had a purpose.”\n\nMore sincerely, though, she said, “Sometimes we’re made to be ashamed of the part of ourselves that seeks connection and relatedness and love as if it’s less important, not productive or weak, but that is the life force. That is the force that binds. That is the creative energy that crosses everything together, that sustains and fosters growth and enhances everything in life. So as vulnerable as it feels, I would try to create from that place and seek that connection.”\n\nMona Fastvold is no stranger to leading from a feminine lens, either. As a director, her filmography consists of “The Sleepwalker,” “The World to Come” and now, “The Testament of Ann Lee” — all of which focus on powerful female characters. Only recently, however, has she come to embrace the label of a “female director.”\n\nShe associates some of that empathetic approach to “female leadership,” which she suggests, “doesn’t just mean women. It means the feminine consciousness in all people is drawing strength from interdependence, not dominance. It’s drawing strengths from intuition, relationships, community and interdependence.”\n\nRegarding being just one of nine women out of 111 directors who helmed 2025’s 100 top-grossing films, Zhao says the data indicates that a more feminine approach “doesn’t fit into the current model that we exist in, the container we exist in. It’s difficult to come through, and I feel very lucky that I had people in power that trusted that this way of leading is needed for this story.”\n\n“I used to resent being called that, and now I love it,” Fastvold told Variety, seated next to the film’s star, Amanda Seyfried. “I will take it. I will be a ‘female director,’ and tell feminist stories about women. I’m very proud of it.”\n\nSeyfried plays the titular heroine, a real-world figure who lived in the 18th century and founded the Shakers, a religious movement that championed gender equality and communal living, and whose followers expressed faith through dance. As chronicled through the film, Lee’s followers began to see her as a female messiah while others marked her for persecution.\n\n“The Shakers worship through ecstatic song and dance,” Fastvold explained. “There was something about this idea of expressing faith through movement and song in such a free and intense and guttural way that was very exciting to me and scary.”\n\nAccordingly, the film is a historical musical. Fastvold initially expressed trepidation towards directing her first musical, but saw the genre as unavoidable given the subject matter.\n\n“Making a musical is scary, even though it’s a different kind of musical,” the director reflected. “I’d never made a musical before. My background is in dance, but I knew that I had to approach it in a different way and that I couldn’t really look to other projects as inspiration for this. So it was kind of terrifying. But the short answer is it had to be a musical because that’s how they worshipped. They kind of lived their life in that way.”\n\nThe director cast Seyfried partially because of her singing and dancing capabilities, as showcased in her roles in “Mamma Mia” and “Les Misérables.” Even so, embodying Lee and choreographing her intense movements proved to be demanding for the seasoned actress.\n\n“As challenging as it was for me to memorize those moves, once I got there, I felt closer to Ann Lee and once we were all moving in unison, it just takes you to another place,” Seyfried said. “You just had to feel like it was part of you. It was an extension of your body, and then it becomes real for that moment in time.”\n\nPart of the challenge came from the fact that the Shakers’ choreographies are buried in history. Seyfried worked with choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall to create and execute dances that were “based on these paintings and drawings and descriptions” of events that took place over two centuries ago.\n\n“The Testament of Ann Lee” star Amanda Seyfried and director Mona Fastvold in conversation with Variety’s Angelique Jackson at the 37th annual Palm Springs International Film Festival. Presley Ann/Getty Images for Palm Springs International Film Society\n\nSeyfried credits the artisans and practitioners across all departments for their thorough research in recreating Lee’s story and the Shaker movement, and she expresses profound esteem for Fastvold, whom the production affectionately referred to as “Mother Mona” on set.\n\n“She is very nurturing,” Seyfried said of Fastvold. “Her job as the director is mothering. The leadership comes from this beautiful, nurturing, female, empowered artist. The nurturing quality of her really impacts how we felt on set and I think it went a long way.”\n\nSimilarly, Fastvold shared how the opportunity to tell a story about a woman whose historical impact had been unsung fueled her sense of purpose while making the film.\n\n“There are so many wonderful, exciting, important female historical figures that are overlooked,” she said. “I feel very lucky that I found Ann Lee.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T23:27:08.818872"}

He consistently promotes non-violence despite the attack on attendees and emotions running high.”\n\nIn fact, at 2:24 p.m. that day, Trump posted on Twitter, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!” Trump sent tweets at 2:38 p.m. and 3:13 p.m. calling for peaceful protest and no violence, but by then the situation was out of control, and it was not until 4:17 that he posted a video instructing those who stormed the Capitol to leave.\n\nThe White House site, in casting the protests as peaceful until Capitol Police exacerbated the situation, contradicted even Trump’s own words in the days after the attack. In a speech on January 8, 2021, Trump said, “To demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol: you have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engage in the acts of violence and destruction: you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law: you will pay.”\n\nThe new White House site also attempts to blame Democrats, and more specifically then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for not doing more to stop the attack. It claims that Pelosi ignored Trump’s offers of National Guard troops. But Politifact and other sites have long deemed such claims as false, and Pelosi herself addressed the claim in an appearance at the Capitol on Tuesday.\n\n“For over three hours we begged him to send the National Guard,” Pelosi said. “He never did it. He took joy in not doing. He was savoring it.” She noted that as president, Trump has authority over the D.C. National Guard, which he has since deployed to the city in his second term. Video footage also shows the extent to which Pelosi was a target of the rioters, as they stormed and ransacked her office.\n\nThe White House site pays tribute to the rioters who died during the assault or shortly afterward, but does not mention the law enforcement officers, reportedly totaling more than 140, who were injured.\n\nNo mention is made of the demonstrators’ erecting of a gallows on the Capitol lawn and chants of “Hang Mike Pence.” Instead, the White House site calls Pence’s refusal to delay election certification “an act of cowardice and sabotage.” Pence has long said that, after consulting with legal advisers, delaying the certification was outside his power as vice president.\n\nOn his first day in office last year, Trump granted clemency to all the January 6th rioters, even those convicted of assaulting police officers.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:42:14 +0000", "fetched_at": "2026-01-06T23:44:08.031044"}
