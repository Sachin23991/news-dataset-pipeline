[&#8230;]", "content": "Theater owners are preparing for a very merry Christmas season.\n\nThis holiday might not be one for the record books, but the lineup of films offers something important — a range of genres and styles — as exhibitors brace for what’s usually the busiest stretch of the year. That’s an important distinction in post-COVID times. Since the pandemic, cinema operators have relied on one billion-dollar behemoth (“Spider-Man: No Way Home” in 2021 and “Avatar: The Way of Water” in 2022) or struggled with none at all (“Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” floundered in 2023 and while “Mufasa” rebounded after a soft start in 2024, “The Lion King” prequel couldn’t claw its way to the billion-dollar mark).\n\nThis year, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will continue to dominate but James Cameron’s sci-fi threequel won’t be alone in enticing audiences. Over the weekend, a trio of holiday releases — A24’s R-rated ping-pong adventure “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” — hope to cater to moviegoers young, old, or disinterested in returning to the alien planet of Pandora.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is aiming for $55 million to $65 million over the traditional weekend and $75 million to $80 million through the four-day holiday frame. Those ticket sales would mark a 30% to 40% decline from its $89 million domestic debut. For context, “Avatar: The Way of Water” dropped by 52% in its sophomore outing after a significantly stronger $134 million debut. Disney and 20th Century’s “Avatar” franchise appears be experiencing diminishing returns, though it’s important to remember these films aren’t known for explosive opening weekends. Instead, “Avatar” installments enjoy exceptional staying power, sticking around at the top of the box office for weeks on end. The first two films, which each ended up grossing over $2 billion globally, were No. 1 for seven consecutive weekends. Barring a surprise, “Fire and Ash” should remain atop the charts in North America well into the new year.\n\nIn terms of new releases, Jack Black and Paul Rudd’s “Anaconda” is expected to lead the pack with $20 million from 3,400 venues between Christmas on Thursday and Sunday. “Marty Supreme” is targeting $12 million to $20 million, while “Song Song Blue” is projected to earn $10 million to $14 million from 2,400 theaters. In general, Christmas releases don’t always deliver huge debuts but tend to play and play on the big screen into January and beyond.\n\n“Anaconda” cost $45 million to produce. A meta-reboot, “Anaconda” follows best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie (you guessed it!) 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down.\n\n“Marty Supreme” had a rollicking start in limited release, breaking into the top 10 with $875,000 while playing on just six screens. Those initial returns are promising ahead of the nationwide expansion, which will test the $70 million-budgeted film’s commercial viability. It helps that Timothée Chalamet, who stars as the fictional table tennis champ Marty Mauser, has been rewriting the rules of movie marketing in terms of getting out the word for an original film. “Marty Supreme” has generated great reviews and encouraging word of mouth. Now the question is: Will Chalamet’s viral antics translate to ticket sales?\n\n“Song Sung Blue” carries a modest $30 million production budget. Craig Brewer directed the film, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band. Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman praised “Song Sung Blue” as “a winning pop nostalgia trip with a dark side.”\n\nWith just two weeks to go, overall domestic revenues are hovering at $8.37 billion, just 1.3% ahead of last year and 22.4% behind 2019, according to Comscore. It’s been a wobbly year with several hits (“Lilo & Stitch,” “Zootopia 2,” “A Minecraft Movie” and “Demon Slayer,” among others) but not enough to offset a number of big-budget flops (“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” and “Snow White,” to name a few). Projections for 2025 were already revised down to $9 billion, but after a brutal fall season, even that milestone feels like a stretch. Will these holiday offerings be able to deliver, or is the box office doomed to fall short of $9 billion for the second consecutive year?", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:52.942238"}

But the [&#8230;]", "content": "If all you know or remember of the eponymous biblical character’s story is that he defeated a hulking giant with a humble slingshot, then “David” might have some surprises in store for you — chief among them, the fact that the film continues for a full hour after this famous, seemingly climactic showdown. But the films of Angel Studios, by and large, are not for audiences only vaguely acquainted with the Bible, and this surprisingly slick animated feature will play best with viewers who can see its every narrative turn coming. That is a sizeable demographic: Released wide last weekend, Brent Dawes and Phil Cunningham‘s film overperformed notably at the box office, landing in the runner-up spot to “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” and aptly defeating relative toon Goliath “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.”\n\nThis is all a perfectly on-the-nose outcome for a tale preaching the message that one must never underestimate the modest and pious when they’re up against the wealthy and decadent. (Or whatever moral descriptor applies to SpongeBob.) But “David” attains its success by cribbing from the playbook of far mightier animation houses: There are shades here of Disney and DreamWorks — the latter’s scripture-based hit “The Prince of Egypt,” in particular — in everything from the film’s character design to its original song score, making for a proficient family entertainment that’s nonetheless a little too precision-engineered to feel truly stirring. Faith, “David” has in spades; soul, not so much.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWith Pixar-wide eyes and a mop of intricately tousled, treacle-brown hair, the young David (voiced by Brandon Engman) presents here as a plucky, intrepid moppet in the typical cartoon-hero mold. He’s introduced as a keen musician and lowly shepherd’s son, dutifully minding his father’s flock on the outskirts of Bethlehem, before swiftly launching into his generic “I want” song, the first of several peppily template-based but swiftly forgettable compositions by Grammy-winning Christian artist Jonas Myrin. Like any cutely drawn protagonist in his position, he yearns for bigger things, though he gets more than he bargained for when — after valiantly protecting his sheep from a preying lion — he’s summoned before the Prophet Samuel (Brian Stivale), who anoints the nonplussed lad the future king of Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, the present king, the insecure and short-tempered Saul (Adam Michael Gold), is facing rejection by God and a declaration of war by preening Philistine monarch King Achish (British comedian Asim Chaudhry, offering something of a throwback to limp-wristed comic stereotypes). Enter David, brought into Saul’s court to soothe the king’s anxieties with his deft lyre-playing, though the tyke soon proves an unexpected military asset: Cue the famed face-off against Goliath, which is quite dazzlingly staged in a vast field of scarlet poppies, petals spraying like confetti when the iceberg-sized monster hits the ground.\n\nTaking place around the 50-minute mark, this scene proves both the narrative and aesthetic peak of a film that, clocking in at an indifferently paced 110 minutes, could test the patience of younger children. Everything that happens after, as David grows into a strapping, stout-hearted man (now voiced by Christian singer-songwriter Phil Wickham) and eventually challenges Saul for the throne that is rightly his, is checked off in fairly rote fashion. Expanding on their 2023 Angel Studios miniseries “Young David,” Dawes and Cunningham obviously hew closely to the Book of Samuel — this isn’t the genre for significant creative license — but also to the familiar rules of any Hollywood hero’s journey.\n\nNone of which would be a debit if their David had a little more personality of his own, but he remains a stubbornly dull anchor for the film, bound by the generally humorless, declamatory tone of the writing. Supporting characters are similarly lacking in wit or detail, while the film’s vocal performances (save for Chaudhry’s odd caricature) are adequate but not especially distinctive. It follows that the faces on screen are perhaps the least characterful element of the film’s generally impressive visual design.\n\nEverything around them, however, is vividly realized, and occasionally even inspired. “David” is nothing if not a spectacular showcase for the technical capabilities of South African animation house Sunrise Productions — demonstrated here both at a large scale, in the palpably dusty, sun-scorched vistas of ancient Israel, and in small, supple glimmers of fire and water. One musical number, “Tapestry,” registers as a standout not for the song but for its visual treatment amid a busy weaving workshop overhung by cotton-candy bales of pastel-dyed wool. Indeed, textiles are perhaps the most consistent marvel of “David,” as even the ecru hessian of the title character’s shepherding smock is rendered with textured, tactile specificity. Reveling in the material may go somewhat against the film’s principles, but respecting the little things does not.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:28:54 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:53.215189"}

Joyce Beatty (D-OH) filed the lawsuit on Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeking a declaration that the name of the arts institution is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and that a board vote last week to change the name is null and void.\n\n“Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center’s name requires an act of Congress,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “But on December 18 and 19, 2025—in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic—the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order. Congress intended the Center to be a living memorial to President Kennedy—and a crown jewel of the arts for all Americans, irrespective of party. Unless and until this Court intervenes, Defendants will continue to defy Congress and thwart the law for improper ends.”\n\nThe Trump controlled board voted to rename the center on Thursday. The next day, workers added Trump’s name to the facade of the complex, so it reads “The Donald Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe lawsuit named Trump, who is chairman of the Kennedy Center, as well as its president, Ric Grenell, and the members of the board, along with the institution itself. Also named are other ex officio members, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr., House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nThe lawsuit cited breach of trustees obligations under federal law and violation of plaintiff’s rights under federal law, among other claims.\n\nBeatty also is seeking an order that “any and all physical and digital signage purporting to\n\nrename the Kennedy Center after Defendant Trump, including the signage on the building’s\n\nfront portico and the website.”\n\nThe center did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Beatty’s lawsuit.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed a law in 1964 designating the National Cultural Center as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. After the Trump-controlled board voted, Democrats and members of the Kennedy family quickly cried foul.\n\nThe lawsuit called the board vote a “sham.”\n\n“The conduct in the Board meeting itself confirmed that the meeting was a sham, orchestrated by Defendant Trump and his loyalists as a pretext for a predetermined result,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “There was no advance notice in the agenda that the Board would be considering a name change. The meeting was held at the home of Andrea Wynn, the wife of a casino mogul and Republican donor, whom Defendant Trump installed on the Board. At the end of the meeting, Defendant Trump’s loyalists abruptly announced that they had news they would like to share: the Kennedy Center would now be renamed after Donald Trump.”\n\nBeatty was on the board meeting call, but was blocked from expressing her concerns because she was put on mute, according to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center later said that ex officio members do not have a vote, something codified in the center’s bylaws.\n\nBut Beatty’s lawsuit contended that the “law does not distinguish between the ex officio trustees and general trustees, and the former possess the same rights and responsibilities as the latter.”\n\nRoma Daravi, spokeswoman for the center, defended the board’s authority to change the name. “This action is in line with the precedent of the State Department adding President Trump’s name to the Institute of Peace. And the previous Administration renaming military bases,” she said in a statement last week. Yet the effort to strip military bases of Confederate names was authorized by an act of Congress in 2021, something that critics of the Kennedy Center renaming say is required.\n\nThe lawsuit also contended that the “purported name change will impose financial and operational harms on this already struggling institution by alienating ticket holders, donors, and artists.” The lawsuit noted that after the name change, musician Kristy Lee announced that she was canceling her Jan. 14, 2026 performance. “On information and belief, ticket holders have canceled their tickets in protest of Defendants’ unlawful actions and demanded refunds. There is every reason to expect this trend will continue, with associated financial and reputational harms,” the lawsuit stated.\n\nBeatty is represented by Norman Eisen, founder of Democracy Defenders Action, and Nathaniel Zelinsky, senior counsel at Washington Litigation Group.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 02:50:25 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T14:42:55.164916"}

The experimental drama examines the social pressures of competitive sports, the use of technology and social media applied to sports, and the link between sports and war, providing a fresh and realistic look at contemporary athletic agonism.\n\nThe film stars Italian judo athlete and Olympic Gold medalist Alice Bellandi and “La Chimera” stars Yile Vianello and Sofija Zobina.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFollowing its premiere in the Venice Film Festival’s Critics’ Week in September, “Agon” was released in Italian cinemas, kicking off Mubi’s Italian theatrical release slate, and has travelled widely on the festival circuit including the Rio, Thessaloniki, Geneva, and Brisbane fests.\n\nBertelli speaks to Variety about his personal connection to the film’s subject matter and how he brought Mubi and The Match Factory on board as producer, Italian theatrical distributor, and global distributor.\n\nYou’ve been involved with the Italian sailing team that competed in the America’s Cup. Is that what prompted you to depict the world of highly competitive sports?\n\nYes, I definitely have a personal connection to this film. But there is also a broader context. It’s true that “Agon” is centred around the world of sports. And of course it’s open to interpretations. But I also use the sports world backdrop of these fictional Olympics that are almost a geopolitical platform, to make a reflection on the role that competitive sports have taken on over the past century. And also to talk more in general about the feeling in life of not being able to achieve one’s goal. So, at one level it’s also the story of three teenagers who are unable to do what they want. This is observed very differently with respect to each character, ​​contextualising this journey in the preparation for competition in a minor sports category of a hypothetical Olympics. Then there’s the broader issue of macro connections between how we came to call sports what they are today. Where does that comes from? And the relationship between war, violence, and sports.\n\nTalk to me about your decision to cast real life world champion judo athlete Alice Bellandi in the film.\n\nI initially conceived “Agon” as an animation project. Then, when I decided to make it live-action, I had two big problems. One was: how do I give it a realistic flavour that establishes trust with the audience? For fencing, I knew I could use a stunt person because in fencing you wear a mask. With shooting, I also knew that it was not a big problem because the athlete has to be very still. But when it comes to judo, I knew I had to find a real judoka. Then reality surpassed my expectations when I met Bellandi, who agreed to be in the film. Then five months after we shot she won the Olympic gold medal in Paris.\n\nIn simplistic terms, “Agon” explores the relationship between sports and technology, which is very clear in competitive sailing. Talk to me about how you weaved this into the film’s narrative.\n\nI’m interested in the relationship between sports and technology, but in a broader sense, which is what I think I’ll continue to look at in the future. What really interests me is the rapport between the organic world and technology, “organic” pertaining to the body in this movie. One example is the surgery [scene] in the film, which is obviously a very crude scene. For me it’s very important because it’s not a metaphor. There are other directors who have addressed this theme [of technology and the body] using metaphorical devices that have shaped my imagination. But I’m fascinated by looking at this [rapport] where it doesn’t exist as a metaphor, but exists purely as reality: a robot that digs into the flesh, into the blood.\n\nTalk to me about your relationship with Mubi. How did you bring them on board in such a big way?\n\nActually, Mubi was involved in “Agon” since the beginning, before anyone else. When I wrote this story as an animation project, I wasn’t actually actively trying to get this film off the ground. I met Efe Cackarel in 2017 when Mubi was much smaller than it is now. We talked about it. I mentioned that I had this story in mind and I’d like to maybe make movies in the future. He said: “I’m interested. I’m also interested in starting to produce in the future and not just be a platform. Why don’t you write the screenplay?” So I wrote the screenplay and started talking about it directly with Mubi. At first we started developing it directly in London as an animation film, but then we realised that it would be too expensive and complex to do it as an animation project.\n\nMeanwhile, my life was changing. I thought: “maybe this could actually be my first feature film. And Efe, rightly, said to me: “Look, you need you to find a producer to take this project forward. But we are on board.” So, with [Italian producer] Max Brun, I introduced myself to Jules Daley, who had just come out of RSA Films. She loved the project and decided to help me and become my producer on this film. So, little by little, “Agon” was born. Then, when the project began to take shape, Mubi came on board. From the very beginning, there was the idea that they would distribute it. But they also became an equity investor. At that point, Mubi had acquired, or was in the process of acquiring, The Match Factory. So, to my great joy, I found myself working with The Match Factory as an international sales agent. Then they said: “Instead of selling the project, we’ll distribute it directly in Italy, because they wanted to start distributing in Italy.”\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:15:22 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T15:30:56.043423"}

In a twist, Captain America is the father to a newborn child.\n\nMarvel is slowly building up to “Doomsday,” which hits theaters in a little less than a year. There will reportedly be more teasers that focus on other characters in the coming weeks. The Captain America trailer leaked online in the run-up to its theatrical debut, and a Thor-focused teaser also appeared in social media leaks this week. It’s expected that it too will run in theaters with showings of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” beginning Thursday, like the Cap teaser.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nJoe and Anthony Russo, who previously directed “Captain America: Winter Soldier,” “Captain America: Civil War,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame” and are back for “Doomsday,” released a short statement on their Instagram page.\n\n“The character that changed our lives,” they wrote of Captain America. “The story that brought us all here together. It was always going to come back to this…”\n\nThe teaser, set on a peaceful farm, begins with Steve riding a motorcycle up to his home as a piano rendition of the “Avengers” theme plays in the background. His blue helmet is reminiscent of his Captain America costume, which he pulls out to reminiscently admire. He holds a newborn baby and looks proudly, as the teaser ends with “Steve Rogers will return for ‘Avengers: Doomsday.'” A countdown timer begins at the end that’s set to expire when “Doomsday” hits theaters.\n\nMarvel fans last saw Captain America, the founding Avenger, in the closing moments of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.” After saving the world from the purple villain known as Thanos, Cap makes it his personal mission to return the missing Infinity Stones to their rightful places across time. After finishing his time-traveling mission, an elderly Steve returns to the main MCU timeline and passes down his red-and-white Vibranium shield to his former sidekick, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), upgrading him from the Falcon to the new Captain America. After bestowing his shield to Sam, Steve then goes back in time to reunite with his beloved Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).\n\nAfter Steve went missing and was frozen in the ice in the original “Captain America” movie, Peggy grew old but never stopped loving him. Now with the Quantum Realm time-traveling technology, the two were able to get married and live out their lives together through the decades.\n\nDoes this teaser mean that Steve somehow returns to the main MCU timeline to rejoin the Avengers? Is this the same Cap, or is he a variant of the elderly hero from the finale of “Endgame”? And who’s the baby. Does he or she have super-soldier powers like Cap?\n\nMarvel also dropped the first poster for “Doomsday,” tinged in a green hue very similar to the colors of Doctor Doom’s famous costume.\n\nTechnically, this isn’t Evans’ first time back in the MCU since “Endgame.” In 2024’s billion-dollar smash “Deadpool & Wolverine,” he returned for a hilarious cameo as the Human Torch, his original superhero role way back in Fox’s “Fantastic Four” movie from 2005.\n\nIn an Esquire profile of Mackie from earlier this year, ahead of the former Falcon taking on the Cap mantle in “Captain America: Brave New World,” Evans said that he was “happily retired” and denied reports that he would return to Marvel.\n\n“That’s not true,” Evans said about his rumored return at the time, explaining that these reports “happen every couple years” since he bowed out in “Endgame.”\n\n“I’ve just stopped responding to it,” he added. “Yeah, no — happily retired!”\n\nEvans isn’t the only original “Avengers” star who will be back for “Doomsday.” Robert Downey Jr. is returning, but not as Tony Stark. Instead, he is replacing his Iron Man armor to play the ultimate villain, Doctor Doom, in the multiverse-crossing movie. Other returning heroes include Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Mackie, Danny Ramirez, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Tom Hiddleston, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Simu Liu, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen and Lewis Pullman.

(Thus, one might’ve expected Cameron to slip a little Na’vi into the interview, not French.)\n\nBut no matter what language he speaks, the filmmaker makes it known he’s not keen to discuss the future of the franchise — at least, not until the box office returns have been counted.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“We’re getting ahead of ourselves because, first of all, we’ve got to make some money with this one,” Cameron says. “Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business case yet again.\n\n“The world has changed. We all know the stats, where theatrical is. It’s been a bad year,” he goes on. “It’s starting to perk up a little bit with a couple of recent releases: ‘Wicked: For Good’ has done well, and ‘Zootopia 2’ is doing well. So, we’ll see.”\n\nCameron is not being modest; he’s a pragmatist. His “Avatar” movies — about the adventures of Marine turned Na’vi leader Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), Na’vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their family — come with significant box office expectations. The original 2009 film and its 2022 sequel, “The Way of Water,” stand as two of the highest-grossing movies in history, with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. “Fire and Ash” earned a strong $345 million globally in its opening weekend, but that figure is down from “The Way of Water’s” $435 million start.\n\nAs Variety’s Rebecca Rubin explains in her box office analysis, Disney spent a massive $350 million to produce the threequel and roughly $150 million to promote it, meaning the big-budget blockbuster needs to deliver in terms of ticket sales for Cameron to move forward with his planned fourth and fifth installments. (For the record, “Avatar 4” is slated for Dec. 2029 and a significant portion of the film has already been shot, while “Avatar 5” is expected to debut Dec. 2031.)\n\nIn the meantime, “Avatar” super fans can also enjoy the making-of documentary, “Fire and Water,” where Cameron reveals how his groundbreaking performance capture process really works. Here, Cameron reflects on how the Disney+ documentary is changing the conversation around performance capture, particularly in the age of generative artificial intelligence, and more about making the new movie, like introducing Oona Chaplin’s villainous Varang and just how spicy her relationship with Quaritch (Stephen Lang) was intended to be.\n\nYou’ve said that you’re always a little nervous before these movies come out. Are you feeling a little better now?\n\nIt’s a good first step. People are responding well. I hadn’t seen it with a big audience before [the premiere], because we’ve done these small press screenings, and I don’t really go to those. There’s some laughs.\n\nDid any of those laughs surprise you?\n\nThe strength of a couple of them surprised me. And then there’s some applause too. There are moments that appear to be quite cathartic for the audience — some of the quieter, emotional stuff. For that, I just look at my wife, Suzy [Amis]; if she’s grabbing her tissues, then I know the scene’s working. It’s a little harder to read that in a big room.\n\nThe crowd applauded for Zoe Saldaña’s performance as Neytiri. You’ve described her work on the “Avatar” movies as “ferocious,” and since we last spoke, she’s won an Oscar [for “Emilia Pérez”]. Do you think pulling the curtain back on how performance capture technology works helps audiences appreciate her performance differently?\n\nThat’s a really great way to put it. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing. I’ve hidden the performance capture methodology because I thought, “I don’t want to see people in a performance capture suit. I want them to think that the characters are real.” Right? But it’s been such a disservice to these actors who are doing some of the best work in their careers. I’ve got Kate Winslet, Academy Award winner; Zoe Saldaña won an Academy Award last year; Sigourney Weaver, a highly respected actress, nominated multiple times. And I just think, “Why am I hiding this under a bushel here? I should be celebrating it.”\n\nJames Cameron (right) directing Zoe Saldaña and Sam Worthington on the set of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Mark Fellman\n\nWe just take all the cinematography — all the cameras and the lenses and the lighting and all that stuff — and we just shove it into the future. It’s like black box theater or a stage rehearsal. A lot of my cast have done theater, and they go, “Oh, this is like, standing up a play.” It’s that quiet, intimate exploration. Everybody said, “Well, how can they possibly do that without all the sets and all the wardrobe?” Well, actors live in their imagination, right? And we give them the things they need. Sigourney said, “I’d really like to have a shawl or something that I can kind of pull around myself and hide behind as this kind of sulky and misunderstood teenager.” It’s like, “Sure, no problem.” It’s a wonderful process. And as a writer-director who’s created these characters, handing that baton to the actors, and then seeing what they do with it, there’s nothing better.\n\nI learned that Sigourney, who plays Kiri, the Sullys’ adopted teenage daughter, actually narrates the next one.\n\nThat could be the case. We’re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nOona Chaplin’s character, Varang, who leads the Ash people, steals the show. But her relationship with Quaritch takes a sexier turn than some people might expect. There’s a mutual seduction, but did you ever consider showing a Na’vi sex scene?\n\nWe never really shot anything beyond what you see. Let’s put it that way. We knew what we were going for was an undercurrent of sensuality, and it’s a PG-13 movie as well.\n\nThe bigger question is, why did we spend 10 minutes — which is an eternity in screen time — not on our main characters, not on our protagonist characters? And the answer is very simple: Because it was cool. That’s my ultimate modus operandi. If it’s cool, we’re gonna explore it. And I’m very proud of that scene where he goes to her, and they go inside the tent, and they tussle over the power. It’s a fun scene.\n\nOona Chaplin as Varang in “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” 20TH CENTURY STUDIOS\n\nMuch like Zoe, this film is a showcase for Oona’s talent. Many people know her from “Game of Thrones” [Chaplin played Talisa Maegyr, Robb Stark’s ill-fated wife], but this is her big screen breakout moment.\n\nI didn’t know who Oona was when I cast her in 2016; I certainly hadn’t seen [“Game of Thrones.”]. But she had such a grasp of the character. Oona herself is just a very warm, beautiful, heartfelt person, almost the exact opposite [of Varang]. But isn’t that fun to play the opposite and find you have the ability to play that. It can be a little scary.\n\nThat’s that actor-director connection that you like to explore.\n\nIn an age of Gen AI chomping at the film industry, that’s another reason I’m pulling back the curtain to show that this is an actor-centric, artist-centric process, and we don’t use those tools. Historically, we haven’t used it at all.\n\nI’m curious about what it can do that’s done ethically and constructively. I don’t want to replace actors, even though people are stampeding to [saying,] “Oh, I can make a film in my mom’s basement, and I don’t need to pay any actors. How cool is that?”\n\nI’ve been mentoring some young filmmakers in New Zealand in a short film class, and I saw presentations for seven projects. All seven of them showed us their storyboards, their pre-viz, their music choices, their mood board, their character design. Not one of the presentations mentioned their cast. Afterwards, I said, “Guys, what the hell is going on here? You didn’t lead with your actors. Do you have actors?” [They said,] “Well, yeah.” And I said, “Why didn’t you lead with that?” I said, “You know what you all need to do when you get your films done? Go do some acting.” I think every director should do some acting. There’s a lot of acting in directing.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:19.742509"}

Fox is one of Hollywood’s most infamous re-castings, it turns out that decision led to a second firing. Hardin was originally cast as Marty’s girlfriend Jennifer Parker.\n\n“‘Back to the Future’ was a huge disappointment. I was 17, you know. I burst into tears,” Hardin told EW. “It was very sad. There were quite a few of those that I remember, you know, things that never really got made. But that I remember being very tough.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHardin revealed earlier this year that she also got the boot from “Back to the Future” when Stoltz was fired because studio executives thought she was too tall to star opposite Michael J. Fox. She explained: “It was apparently the two female executives at the time that thought that it was emasculating for their lead male character to be in scenes with a woman that was taller than him. If I had done it, I’m sure it would have all gone in a different way. I wouldn’t have done ‘The Office.'”\n\n“To be where I am, you have to have failed more than you’ve succeeded,” Hardin now told EW. “I think people don’t realize that when they look at it from the outside — you have to really be somebody who’s comfortable with failure, and with putting yourself on the line all the time. That failure doesn’t mean anything about you. You just have to fail better, and keep failing better … to be able to really weather this career choice.”\n\nStoltz and Hardin were in production for six weeks on “Back to the Future” when the decision was made to boot Stoltz and recast the lead role with the director’s first choice, Fox, who had originally been blocked from the film due to his commitment to the NBC sitcom “Family Ties.” Hardin was replaced by Claudia Wells. Fox revealed in his new memoir, “Future Boy,” that he wrote a letter to Stoltz asking to finally meet 40 years after the recasting.\n\n“Eric has maintained his silence on the subject for 40 years, so I was prepared for the likelihood that he’d prefer to keep it that way,” Fox writes in the memoir, noting the two had never come face to face to discuss the casting swap. Fox wrote to him: “If your answer is ‘piss off and leave me alone’… That works, too.”\n\nStoltz responded with a “beautifully written reply” that “began, ‘Piss off and leave me alone!’ Thankfully, this was followed by ‘I jest…’ Eric was thoughtful about my outreach, and although he respectfully declined to participate in the book, he seemed open to the idea of getting together.”\n\nWhen Fox and Stoltz finally found themselves together in the same room, the actors “immediately fell into an easy dialogue about our careers, families, and yes, our own trips through the space-time continuum,” Fox writes. “[Stoltz entered] with a smile, and we quickly acknowledged that neither of us had an issue with the other. What transpired on ‘Back to the Future’ had not made us enemies or fated rivals; we were just two dedicated actors who had poured equal amounts of energy into the same role. The rest had nothing to do with us. As it turned out, we had much more in common than our spin as Marty.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:06:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T16:35:19.981063"}

Tickets, according to the suit, “were massively discounted for patrons who identified as black, indigenous, or people of color.

It initially started out to be the studio’s desire to remake or “reimagine” their 1997 horror movie of the same name that starred Ice Cube, Jon Voight, and Jennifer Lopez among others and dealt with a National Geographic film crew hijacked by an insane hunter in his quest to bag an elusive giant snake. Studios naturally love to find a way to just repeat their successful IP and Anaconda was enough of a hit to think about a reboot all these years later. If Jumanji keeps working for Sony, why can’t this one also? And director Tom Gormican and his co-screenwriter Kevin Etten had a unique idea, quite an inspired one. Previously they had paired on the very funny 2022 comedy, The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent with Nicolas Cage playing a whacked out version of Nicolas Cage.\n\nSimilarly their pitch for this one was to turn it into a comedy vehicle, that also takes satirical shots at the movie business. Two down-on-their-luck guys come to a point in life where they team up to do a remake of their favorite movie as teenagers, Anaconda. Take a sharp premise for laughs and add in the first-ever teaming of Paul Rudd and Jack Black, and you have a recipe for a LOL good time at the movies. Comedy has been in short supply of late, and this one is sort of sneaking in at the end of a year where a traditional movie comedy is suddenly an endangered species. Naked Gun ably filled the bill over the summer, and I loved Aziz Ansari’s Good Forturne with Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves also in the cast, but that one sadly opened and closed this Fall without making much of an impression on audiences. There just aren’t that many comedies that aren’t also masquerading as something else. This one just wants to make you laugh. It does.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHere Gormican switches up the expected casting by making Black largely the straight man to Rudd’s crazier friend. Doug McCallister (Black) is a frustrated filmmaker stuck in a dead-end job as a wedding videographer, always wanting to sell his blockbuster tentpole ideas to the bride and groom who just only want the traditional treatment, not the blood and gore he has in mind. Ronald Griffin Jr, aka Griff (Rudd) is a failed actor with a few small credits, most notably a 4 episode arc on Swat, who gets fired from his latest job and then comes up with the idea to call Griff, get their school cameraman Kenny (Steve Zahn) and Griff’s ex-girlfriend Claire (Thandiwe Newton) back together to go to the Amazon and do a low budget remake of Anaconda, which through happenstance somehow Doug claims he has the remake rights.\n\nWith a reluctant Doug finally aboard after his wife Malie (Ione Skye) convinces him to live the dream, they all leave Buffalo for the snake infested waters of Brazil’s Amazon. After getting a boat and a captain, Ana (Daniela Melchior) the first order of duty is sign on a title star, and they get one, a professional huge anaconda named Heitor who comes with his trainer and best friend, a local named Santiago (Selton Mello). Though Heitor is claimed to be no more harmful than a puppy, there are some moments of fright for Griff who is a little uneasy acting opposite him and at one point panics and tosses him overboard resulting in Heitor’s gruesome demise. Santiago is distraught and wracked with grief while Doug and Griff now have to figure out how to replace their star with another snake to keep this production afloat. Well isn’t the Amazon full of these things? They will find one. Not a good idea when suddenly the real thing starts to eat everyone for dinner.\n\nWith Australia’s Queensland coast standing in the Amazon, Gormican skillfully milks all the inherent humor in the situation while also not letting the horror aspects of the original film overtake this one, at least not enough to threaten a PG13 rating. Thankfully he has this cast and a teaming of Rudd and Black who never go into Abbott & Costello territory with the premise but create likeable characters trying to find the spark of life and creative worth they once had in school. And although Black is largely playing it pretty straight he does have a killer signature scene involving a Wild Boar carcass attached to his back as bait for the real anaconda. Priceless Jack Black stuff.

It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions.\n\n\n\nTo commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood.\n\n\n\nAfter months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment.\n\n\n\nNotice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming.\n\n\n\nWe intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news.\n\n\n\nWhen you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line.\n\n\n\nAlso, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion.\n\n\n\nWe also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options.\n\n\n\nVariety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here.\n\n\n\nSpoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs.

Just a few weeks ago, she appeared in Rachel Sennott’s new comedy series, I Love LA, which has already been renewed for a second season. And now, the world is about to see her opposite Timothée Chalamet in Josh Safdie‘s much-anticipated A24 film Marty Supreme.\n\nSo, where did she come from? When we meet via Zoom, A’zion addresses this right away, saying, “It’s really funny, because I’m seeing a lot of these things online of people being like, ‘Odessa A’zion just came out of nowhere and she’s an industry plant.’ And I’m like, ‘I’ve been acting for 10 years now.’”\n\nVery early roles included an episode of her mom Pamela Adlon’s show Better Things, and in the past few years, A’zion has been in the Dakota Johnson-starrer Am I OK?, the comedy series Ghosts, and this year the films Pools and Until Dawn. It was this last she was shooting in Budapest when she found an old phone booth and used it to record a self-tape audition for Marty Supreme — a scene in which her character, Rachel Mizler, is in a 1950s-era phone booth negotiating with the owner of a dog Marty is holding for ransom (yes, you read that correctly).\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nRachel is crazy in love with Chalamet’s Marty Mauser — a ping pong king and hustler extraordinaire, loosely based on a real person named Marty Reisman. Ultimately, both Rachel and Marty will reveal a level of determination that leans towards the twisted. Here, A’zion reveals how she persevered through a long period of not booking anything, how a long-ago Euphoria audition led to the role of Rachel and how her acting style blended with Chalamet’s approach.\n\nDEADLINE: Last time we met it was at a panel onstage at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival and we talked about I Love LA.\n\nI think that was my first ever [on-stage Q&A]. That’s not true. I had done it once before, for Pools, but that felt like my first ever panel in front of a big audience like that.\n\nDEADLINE: Since then, you’ve been doing a lot of interviews. The last few months must have been very intense in the run-up to the Marty Supreme premiere. How are you coping with it?\n\nIt has definitely been crazy. It’s definitely a new thing I’d never experienced before. How am I coping with it? I’m learning the ways. I’m trying to get past anxieties of talking to big groups of people. That’s scary. I have stage fright, so that’s really hard. Which I know maybe just goes away with experience of getting on stage more, but I never wanted to get on stage in front of people because it’s scary as hell. But I’m just excited that people are getting to see the show and the movie and projects that I care so deeply about. So if that means me having to do that, then I’m happy to be a part of it.\n\nOdessa A’zion in ‘Marty Supreme’ A24\n\nDEADLINE: Tell me about the process of getting the role of Rachel in Marty Supreme? I know that you sent in some self-tapes you made in a Hungarian phone booth.\n\nI feel like for me personally, and when I first started acting and doing my own thing, I feel like I didn’t book anything for a really long time, I don’t know. It took a really long time for me to book something. And it really didn’t happen until I started making my tapes my own and dressing as the character, what I thought the character would look like, versus people telling me, “Just wear neutral colors, go with a blank background.” And when I first started, it was in person too anyway, so it was whatever background they had. But self-tapes, I feel like are so special because you really have an opportunity to make it your own and make it as realistic as you want to make it. And if I didn’t find a phone booth, I was going to find a way to find a phone booth.\n\nI sent the tape a sh-t-ton of times, a bunch of different tapes over the course of a couple days. And I memorized that faster than I’ve ever memorized anything in my life.\n\nDEADLINE: Because the audition was the scene where Rachel’s in the phone booth in the movie…\n\nYeah. Which I think is way worse in the movie than my audition was. But yeah, it was a tape that had come about. I had met with Josh beforehand and Jennifer [Venditti, casting director] remembered me from my audition for Euphoria years ago and thought that I was right for this role, and was trying to tell Josh that she felt that she found his Rachel. And at first, when I met with him, he thought I was maybe too young and it didn’t go my way. And then a couple months later, it came back around and I was able to send the tape. I sent an improv portion, I sent an interview portion. And I mean, I sent the tape a sh-t-ton of times, a bunch of different tapes over the course of a couple days. And I memorized that faster than I’ve ever memorized anything in my life because I never will do a tape not memorized, like holding the paper. I feel it’s so important to show that you really took time and care about it. But yeah, after that, Jen and Josh Fac-Timed me. Josh was showing me around the stadium because the movie used to have a different ending and they were scouting for the stadium for the ending. And he was like, “This is where we’re going to shoot this. And this is where we shoot this. And this is Jack Fisk, he’s doing the set design.” I’m [thinking], what the f–k is going on? Did I get the part or are you just like, dangling it? And then he told me that I got the part. It was so crazy.\n\nDEADLINE: Did you have the full script? Did you know about the different ending at the time?\n\nI had the script with the original ending before it was changed a couple different times, and then a couple things just had to be cut timing-wise in the movie because otherwise it would’ve been an even longer movie. I feel like they got it to a really good time.\n\nTimothée Chalamet in ‘Marty Supreme’ A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nDEADLINE: Did you do chemistry reads with Timothée before you got the role? Obviously your characters have this intense connection.\n\nNo, no. Nothing. Personally, I feel like Josh, I think he’s got a really good read on actors — a really, really good read. And I think he could just tell if someone will work with someone else beforehand. I think if he has an intuition on someone or something, he’s going to go with it, no matter what. Even if maybe they don’t have chemistry in person or something, I think he can see his vision.\n\nDEADLINE: So, then what was your first interaction with Timothée? Did you just go right into shooting?\n\nJosh thought that it would be a good idea to have us go and have breakfast together somewhere. Or maybe it was dinner. Me, Josh, and Timmy at this little diner in New York. And so, we just hung there for a little bit, and all talked before we started things. I was so excited to start that movie. That movie just is so special for so many reasons. I was kind of feeling at a time where I know I want to do acting with my life… I was just talking to my agent and friend a couple days before I got the tape and I’m like, “Dude, I love working. I love doing these horror movies and I love doing these Indies.” But I’m just like, “I don’t know if I’m going to ever have a career more than this.” And then… This is the first time I’m in something of this scale and this character. I’ve been thinking about that so much. I feel so lucky that I was able to be a part of it. And I feel like Rachel came at such an important time in my life too, just mentally, because I felt like she came when I really needed her. I don’t know, not to get emotional… It was just a hard, hard year, a lot of loss, a lot of people lost and you can’t do anything about that. Once people are gone, they’re gone. So this whole thing felt really, really special and kismet and from the angels, kind of. She’s just such a special character to me.\n\nPenn Jillette, Kevin O’Leary, Timothée Chalamet, Odessa A’zion, Tyler, The Creator, Gwyneth Paltrow and Koto Kawaguchi at the ‘Marty Supreme’ LA Premiere\n\nDEADLINE: What do you think of Rachel? She’s scrappy. She’ll do what it takes to get out of a situation.\n\nShe, in a way, feels like a mixture of inner child and chaos and freedom, while also being really, really strong, secure adult. She’s so confident in what she wants and what she believes she deserves for herself. I wish I had that confidence and to defend yourself and stand up for yourself. And I just think she’s just a really layered, really beautiful strong, character… I just think she’s so stuck in this world. I mean, you look at 1952 and her situation and her husband and being pregnant with the other guy’s baby, but she really wants to be with the other guy, because they’ve loved each other their whole lives. And she’s just so stuck. She’s just restrained by this societal pressure to settle down and get married and do it fast, when she knew that she wanted to be with this other person. And so she takes it into her own hands. She says, “OK, if he doesn’t want to be with me this way, I’m going to show him.” I really, really admire her.\n\nI’m going to go home and watch Hitchcock because I know that those are the movies that were going around at that time. And I’m going to chop my hair off for the role and strip the color out to make her feel younger.\n\nDEADLINE: I interviewed Timmy for A Complete Unknown last year, and one of the things we talked about was how much he immersed himself in this role for Marty Supreme. Tell me about your impressions of working with him, the way he works, and the way your styles fit together as actors.\n\nSo, I think in ways we’re very similar and in ways we’re very different. We’re very similar in ways of we just want it to be as authentic as it possibly can be, which means for me, less rehearsal. Let’s just go in and do it and feel it out and feel what comes. And if there’s something that one of us is stuck on, let’s talk about it. We can easily talk about it. There’s not one of us saying, “I don’t want to talk about it.” It’s fully open, flowy. If one of us feels stuck, we’re there.\n\nBut then [we’re] different in the other sense of he really immerses himself in the character in that way — I don’t really know because I haven’t really talked to him about it, so I cannot speak on his behalf, but from what I’ve witnessed. Versus for me, I immerse myself in the character in just a different way where I’m going to go home and watch Hitchcock because I know that those are the movies that were going around at that time. And I’m going to chop my hair off for the role and strip the color out to make her feel younger. Josh liked my natural color better, and I’m going to make my hair super frizzy so that I’m extra Jewish for the role because that’s what that character was. And I’m going to put the weights on my belly so that I could really feel like I’m pregnant. I’m going to make the playlists so that I have the Rachel playlist of what I think that she was listening to then. And then just a playlist of what I feel about Rachel and Marty’s love. So, I immerse myself in a different way than Timmy immerses himself. I think he needs to be locked into the character in just a different way, but we work with each other really, really well. And I loved working with him and he’s just so incredible. He’s such an amazing actor.\n\nRachel Sennott and Odessa A’zion in ‘I Love LA’ HBO\n\nDEADLINE: Do you feel ready for everyone to see the film when it premieres in a couple days?\n\nI don’t know. I’m a little scared. I’m really, really excited for people to see the movie. I’m really excited for people to see the movie because it’s just such an incredible movie, and these filmmakers, they really have a vision. And I’m so grateful to have been a part in it, in even the tiniest way. It happened really fast. I feel like we just finished filming and boom, now it’s coming out.\n\nDEADLINE: And what are you most excited about making Season 2 of I Love LA?\n\nI’m just excited to go back with all the cast. And the character’s very different for me. We talk different, we walk different. I feel like we look a little different. So that’s always really weird for me, but it’s really fun to do with the cast and to be able to shoot at home because I’m from LA, I live in LA. It’s the best. I’m super excited to go back.\n\nMarty Supreme is in theaters from December 25th.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:46:52 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T19:00:39.745461"}

He was 68.\n\nArkadie was born on Dec. 10, 1957. He grew up in Maryland and received his BFA in acting from Southern Methodist University in Dallas before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in entertainment. He secured his first job as a staff writer on the NBC drama series “I’ll Fly Away.”\n\nHe subsequently created “New York Undercover” with Wolf in 1994. The series, which starred Malik Yoba and Michael DeLorenzo as undercover NYPD officers, was the first American cop drama to feature two people of color as the leads. It ran on Fox for four seasons before going off the air in 1999.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDuring and after “New York Undercover,” Arkadie produced “Chicago Hope” on CBS, “NYPD Blue” on ABC and “The Shield” on FX, among other series. He also continued to write, penning episodes of the NBC miniseries “The Temptations” and serving as showrunner on BET’s “Sacrifice” for two seasons.

We remain grateful for his contributions, and he will be deeply missed and always remembered.\n\nLamar also released a statement, calling Arkadie “a consummate professional, true collaborator, and astute researcher” while Arkadie’s cousin and fellow producer L True Green called him “one of America’s greatest storytellers” in a Facebook post.\n\nArkadie is survived by his wife and family.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:21:16 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:21.066953"}

How ‘The Ugly Stepsister’ Make-Up Team Recreated ‘Cinderella’ as a Body Horror", "link": "https://variety.com/2025/artisans/news/ugly-stepsister-body-horror-cinderella-1236616590/", "summary": "Norwegian director Emilie Blichfeldt&#8217;s feature debut &#8220;The Ugly Stepsister&#8221; takes inspiration from an unlikely pair of genres: Disney fairy tales and Italian Giallo films.

The movie, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and was acquired by Shudder, reimagines “Cinderella” as a body horror film from the empathetic perspective of the titular, vilified sibling, Elvira (Lea Myren). As Elvira prepares for the prince’s royal ball, she undergoes body transformations large and small to try conforming to society’s highest beauty standards.\n\n“The most important thing was to make just a normal, cute teenager who is just really in love with this prince,” explains the movie’s makeup designer Anne Cathrine Sauerberg, “and to show what people do to themselves.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nJust the initial effect of making the 24-year-old Myren look like a teenager was a feat for the prosthetic and makeup departments. “She was wearing cheeks and a nose and has a fake neck that actually stops in the middle of the neck,” says prosthetic makeup designer and special effects artist Thomas Foldberg. “We didn’t want her neck to be too broad. We wanted to erase the collarbone and some of the neck muscles. We wanted to make her softer without exaggerating, so it had to be kept really tight and really subtle.”\n\nAt first, Elvira’s transformations are indeed subtle. At the behest of her mother, Rebekka (Ane Dahl Torp), Elvira undergoes a cosmetic nose realignment, executed in the archaic medical practices of the film’s 19th-century setting. The doctor (Adam Lundgren) intentionally fractures Elvira’s nose and she wears a face brace for much of the first act, removing it once to reveal a partially healed, misshapen ridge and later removing it again to reveal a much more conventional nose. Because Foldberg and Sauerberg had Myren in a prosthetic nose from the beginning, they were able to adjust it accordingly to create the subtle change.\n\nThe subtlety decreases as Elvira further modifies her body in anticipation of the ball. Once her nose is in place, Elvira gets an eyelash transplant whereby the same doctor threads fake lashes through her lower eyelid. The camera captures the procedure in an extreme close-up of Elvira’s eye and reverse shots from Elvira’s horrifying perspective.\n\nTo achieve the realistic look of the extreme close-up, Foldberg opted for a blend of practical and digital effects. He collaborated with visual effects supervisor Peter Hjort to composite the actor’s actual eye onto a dummy head. “We did the whole scene with the actress and then we did it with the fake head, which I was actually stitching into, and everything was put together afterwards” Foldberg explains. “It’s basically half a dummy head from the eyelids below and then the other part is the actor herself.”\n\nThe film’s most gruesome scene, however, comes after the ball and is ripped straight from the pages of the original “Cinderella” folk tale. In an effort to fit into the slipper that her stepsister Agnes (Thea Sofie Loch Næss) left at the ball, Elvira severs the toes from her right foot. In a series of sanguinary close-ups, Elvira takes a cleaver to her digits, first slicing them and then fully dismembering them.\n\n“It was extremely complicated to do the slit where the blood is kind of beating out,” explains Foldberg. “That was one big prosthetic foot and then we had two fake legs that went from under her knees and below. We had this blood rigged leg for the initial chopping off of the toes and then it had some small attachments.”\n\nAfter Elvira cuts off her toes and is bleeding out, Rebekka finds her and realizes that she severed the wrong foot for the slipper. Obsessively, Rebekka recreates the wound on Elvira’s left foot, this time captured in a wide shot that shows the foot and leg attached to Elvira’s body. “The real leg was hidden under her dress,” says Foldberg of the shot. “It’s just bent and then the prosthetic leg goes from the knee and down.”\n\nDespite her pathological efforts, Elvira fails to win over the prince and in the final sequence, she crawls about on her broken feet, her hair thinning and teeth chipped from the trauma she’s put herself through.\n\nMuch of that trauma stems from a tapeworm egg that Elvira consumes to lose weight at the beginning of her transformation. By the end, the worm is fully grown, several feet long, and Elvira’s sister, Alma (Flo Fagerli) must help her remove it in a gristly game of tug of war. To achieve the effect of Alma extracting the worm from Elvira’s mouth, Foldberg and his team created several silicone worm pieces and then fed them through a contraption attached to the side of Myren’s face. The contraption was composited out in post-production to make it look like the worm is expelled from the depths of Elvira’s throat. “We also had a puppet head of her from the nose down,” says Foldberg. “Where you could push big chunks of this worm and slime out of her.”\n\nThe film as a whole used minimal CGI and instead went for practical effects paired with compositing, creating a raw and seamless look throughout. This ingenuity paid off, as “The Ugly Stepsister” is now shortlisted for Best Makeup & Hairstyling at the upcoming 98th Academy Awards. It is Shudder’s first shortlisted film in the category.\n\nFor the film’s success, Sauerberg and Foldberg credit Blichfeldt. “She was so well prepared and had so many ideas,” says Foldberg. “I was really, really blown away by her knowledge of genre films and she had really a specific vision for this project.”\n\n“We all know Cinderella’s story so well, so we all have different pictures of how it should look like, and [Blichfeldt’s] vision was just so extremely clear,” adds Sauerberg. “It was so easy to connect with her and her visions and align them with my own visions.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:16:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:21.481439"}

The film, which opens in theaters on Dec. 24 via Independent Film Company, is an unconventional horror tale about a young boy named Ben (Everett Blunck), who is new to the social structure of an all-boys water polo camp. Other children, under the direction of their cruel peer Jake (Kayo Martin) and with very little adult supervision, alienate shy young Eli (Kenny Rasmussen) by saying he has the titular disease. Things get uncomfortable from there.\n\nThe casual viciousness of children is the centerpiece of the film, which has triggered audiences who grew up in the same era as Polinger. After he directed a 2018 short film named “Sauna” with similar themes, he caught COVID and was quarantined in his childhood bedroom. While there, Polinger went through his journals and was reminded of the genesis of the “Plague” game and the memories of people he hadn’t thought about in ages.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I’ve been surprised every step of the way, even just how cross-generational and cross-cultural that sentiment of youth seems to be,” he says. “I had that experience looking at these journals, where it was a sensory portal bringing me back to a time that I had really buried. It was very intense and visceral and overwhelming. I think that the movie has that effect on other people, where it’s like that smell, that candle that brings you back to certain times in life. That takes you on your own journey, and anyone might apply something personal to the movie. People come up to me after screenings and talk to me about their experiences, very personal stories.”\n\nAlthough the film is a period piece set a few decades ago without cellphones, it’s being released at a time when the country is run by President Trump, who frequently uses bullying to set the national tone. Polinger says that although his film is informed by specificity, it can speak broadly to many different cultural touchpoints.\n\n“My feeling about films in general is, when you’re making something that feels as honest as possible and personal, those things usually apply in larger political ways,” he says. “I think there are dynamics of how bullying works, but also how social hierarchies are developed, and myths are made. ‘The Plague’ is kind of a myth. In the beginning, it’s clearly a very dumb game and a dumb joke, and it’s not taken very seriously. But because everyone else chooses to take it seriously, because everyone else is doing it, it starts to become something increasingly real because the collective has made it so.\n\n“Jake, as a ringleader, will look at you like you’re crazy if you don’t take it seriously,” Polinger continues. “You want to fit in with Jake because it’s too scary not to have his approval, because he’s so charismatic, and he’s bonding with everyone else by making fun of the outcast. So you don’t want to be that person. You play the rules of the game, and suddenly they become crystallized. I think that paradigm applies to bigger social structures, political things … in general, authoritarianism. There are cycles of this throughout history that are built around the same human instincts that, hopefully, this film is exploring through a more personal lens.”\n\nAfter “The Plague,” Polinger is set to adapt a high-profile property, helming a feature-length version of Edgar Allan Poe’s short story “The Masque of the Red Death,” starring Oscar winner Mikey Madison. Polinger is excited to start filming his unique vision of the classic text.\n\n“It’s definitely inspired by the short story, but it goes into a completely new story,” he says. “So it’s a very bombastic, irreverent, dark comedic tale, set in this medieval, slightly fantastical world. It’s not a modernized version of it at all. It’s high energy, it’s out there and very different in many ways on the surface from ‘The Plague,’ but also exploring claustrophobic group dynamics — just from a very different genre and tone.”\n\nWatch the trailer for “The Plague” below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.054550"}

Now, less than a month after Season 5 Volume 1 and days ahead of Volume 2, Netflix reports that the entirety of “Stranger Things” has crossed 1.2 billion views in total.\n\nThat statistic, calculated by dividing the total amount of time the series has ever been streamed by the combined runtime of all available episodes, puts “Stranger Things” as a whole above any series in Netflix history — even “Wednesday” and “Squid Game,” which are the only projects with individual seasons that rank above “Stranger Things” Season 4. Released in 2023, Season 4 remains at No. 2 on Netflix’s list of its most popular English-language TV title of all time. Season 3, which is more than six years old now, only recently fell off that chart.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAs such, the most-rewatched scenes in the show’s history came in those seasons: No. 1 is the scene in Season 4 Episode 7 when Nancy (Natalia Dyer) falls into a trance while being possessed by Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), followed by the Season 3 Episode 8 scene when Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Suzie (Gabriella Pizzolo) sing the “NeverEnding Story” theme song together.\n\nIn just 25 days, Volume 1 of Season 5 has reached 102.6 million views. It’s all but guaranteed that Season 5 will make the all-time viewership chart next month; if it was eligible now, before its final episode have been released, it would already rank at No. 9, between “Bridgerton” Season 3 (2024) and “The Night Agent” Season 1 (2023). Plus, Netflix measures its all-time chart ending 91 days after each title’s final episodes are released, meaning Season 5 will continue accruing views until three months after the New Year’s Eve finale. The season has a solid shot to make it to No. 1 during the first quarter of 2026.\n\nIn addition, “Stranger Things” Season 5 has ranked as the most-watched title of the week in 90 of the 93 countries Netflix tracks while also directing viewers back to previous seasons. “Stranger Things” became the first Netflix series to have four seasons in the Top 10 at once, then the first to chart with five seasons — and all five seasons remain on the chart even now, four weeks since Season 5 debuted. And since the advent of the Netflix Top 10 in 2021, the series’ five seasons have made the global Netflix Top 10 a combined 78 times. All 93 countries tracked have seen on “Stranger Things” on their individual Top 10 lists at one point or another.\n\nStill, the reach of “Stranger Things” expands beyond Netflix views.\n\nThe show made headline after headline for its use of “Running Up That Hill” in Season 4. 38 years after the song was released, “Stranger Things” helped earn Kate Bush her first-ever Top 10 hit in the U.S. Additionally, Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” (1986) made the U.K. Top 10 for the first time after being used in the season.\n\nWith Season 5, that effect has been replicated again and again. According to Spotify, several oldies have seen major streaming boosts since their use in Volume 1. Among Gen Z, Diana Ross’ “Upside Down” (1980) saw an increase in streams of 1,250% and Tiffany’s “I Think We’re Alone Now” (1987) jumped by 880%. Across all demographics, streams have risen for The Chordettes’ “Mr. Sandman” (1954) by 625% and for ABBA’s “Fernando” (1976) by 335%, with the latter getting a 645% boost with Gen Z. The music streamer also reports that users have created 205,000 “Stranger Things”-themed playlists since Season 1 debuted in 2016.\n\nEggo, the frozen waffle brand that has existed since 1956, enjoyed renewed interest after being prominently featured in “Stranger Things” as the favorite snack of Millie Bobby Brown’s character, Eleven. Parent company Kellogg’s reported 14% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, which followed the release of Season 2, and 9.4% growth in the first four months of 2018.\n\nNetflix also boasts that interest in “Dungeons & Dragons” has grown by 673% since the 2016 debut of “Stranger Things,” which constantly references the table-top role-playing game — though it must be noted that the “Dungeons & Dragons” universe has made many big strides of its own over the last nine years, including expansions to the game itself, a 2023 feature film and more. Still, its rise — which also includes sales increases of 96% in both 2017 and 2018 — was still heavily impacted by “Stranger Things,” and the show and game have released multiple official collaborations.\n\nThe show also drove a collaboration between Netflix and Nabisco, with the snack company releasing limited-edition “Stranger Things” Chip’s Ahoy cookies ahead of Season 5. The campaign around the cookies reached 11 billion impressions.\n\nNaturally, the series has been a massive boon to the business of content. Since 2016, “Stranger Things” has created more than 8,000 production jobs in the U.S. and contributed $1.4 billion to the national GDP.\n\nThat impact has been strongest in Georgia, where most of the series was filmed, with $650 million contributed to the state GDP and more than 2,000 vendors involved in production. Next in line was California, with $500 million contributed to the state GDP.\n\n“Stranger Things” has also spawned a universe of its own, even before on-screen spinoffs have been released. In the U.S. alone, “Stranger Things” books, comics and other publishing projects have crossed 3.1 million sales since Season 1. “Stranger Things: The Experience,” a live event that was first produced in 2022, has led to 850,000 ticket sales across cities including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, London, Paris, Brazil and Australia. Other live events around the globe, pegged to Season 5 specifically, have attracted more than 300,000 fans across 32 cities and 23 countries, with highlights including the “One Last Ride” cycling event in Los Angeles (50,000 fans) and a parade in São Paulo (13,000). There are still more events to come in London, Bangkok, Milan, Las Vegas and Madrid as 2025 concludes.\n\nAnd in an unprecedented move especially for Netflix, the series finale on New Year’s Eve will be played in movie theaters in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n“Stranger Things: The First Shadow” a play that serves as a prequel to the TV series, debuted in London’s West End in 2023, with a Broadway transfer opening earlier this year. The play won four Tony Awards in the U.S. plus two Olivier Awards and Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards in the U.K. — adding to the 70 awards and 230 nominations the TV series has earned to date, which includes 12 Emmy wins.\n\nAnd when looking at the career trajectories of the young cast of “Stranger Things,” the series can be looked at as a Disney Channel-like talent pipeline, generating celebrities out of tweens who were relatively unknown beforehand. Brown has become Netflix royalty, leading the films “The Electric State” and “Damsel” — the latter being the streamer’s No. 10 most popular English-language movie of all time, plus the “Enola Holmes” franchise, which has a third film premiering in 2026.\n\nSocial media is another good measure of the cast’s rise. Netflix’s earliest tracked Instagram follower count for Brown — which came before “Stranger Things Season 1 debuted but potentially after trailers and marketing had been released — was 2.1 million, and she now has more than 68 million. Sadie Sink, who plays Max, has the next-highest following with 26.8 million, up from 1.1 million before her debut in Season 2. Other following increases include 6,400 to 23 million for Finn Wolfhard; 10,000 to 23.4 million for Noah Schnapp; 18,000 to to 13 million for Caleb McLaughlin; and 20,000 to 17 million for Matarazzo. New Season 5 stars Jake Connelly and Nell Fisher have seen increases from 12,000 to 582,000 and 30,000 to 875,000, respectively.\n\nAlso on social, the pre-launch marketing campaign for “Stranger Things” Season 5 was Netflix’s biggest ever with 5.8 billion impressions. The concurrent rewatch campaign for previous seasons generated 1.3 billion impressions, and “Stranger Things: The Experience” has achieved 2 billion social impressions to date. Even the show’s Easter eggs have gone viral; the subtle inclusion of a “Missing Teen” hotline for Eleven in Season 5 went viral online and resulted in more than 1 million calls.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.324121"}

Netflix has, of course, thrown its weight behind a hefty marketing campaign for Emily in Paris Season 5, which included a press preview aboard a Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train for a 24-hour journey from Venice to Paris. The stunt also offered press interactions with lead cast including Lily Collins and Ashley Park during tea service, Aperitivo Hour, a three-course dinner, and late-night afterparty.

The first four episodes alone have now generated 102.6M views globally to date, just ahead of the Vol. 2 release on Christmas Day. The season came in fourth place on the weekly TV list, but it’s expected to shoot right back up to first place next week thanks to those three new episodes.\n\nAnd, in fact, that already makes it one of Netflix’s most-watched seasons of television ever, soaring right past The Night Agent and Fool Me Once on the English-language most popular list.

So, now the only question is how high it will go.\n\nAll four previous seasons were once again in the Top 10 as well: Season 1 at No. 8 (3.5 million views), Season 2 at No. 10 (3.3 million views), Season 3 at No. 7 (3.6 million views), and Season 4 at No. 6 (3.9 million views)\n\nThe actual biggest title of the week was a Korean disaster film called The Great Flood with 27.9M views, while Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery took No. 1 on the English film list with 20.9M views.\n\nSurprise, surprise, Kpop Demon Hunters came in third with 7.9M views and has now surpassed 500M views since premiere.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:27:32 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.758364"}

It has made a couple of theatrical runs (including a sing-along version) that has grossed $24.6 million. On the awards front, the pic has Best Animated Film noms from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, and it was voted the year’s best in that category from the New York Film Critics Circle. Its soundtrack snagged five Grammy nominations behind the smash hit “Golden,” which also made the Oscar Original Song shortlist.\n\nA sequel is in the works eyeing a 2029 release.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nKPop Demon Hunters’ narrative centers on their battle against the Saja Boys, a rival boy band whose members are secretly demons serving the villain Gwi-Ma, a flaming, all-consuming mouth inspired by Korean mythology.\n\nThe story, which originated from Kang, is anchored by the internal struggle of the group’s leader, Rumi, voiced by Arden Cho, who harbors the secret that she is half-demon. Trained to believe that all demons are inherently evil, Rumi lives in fear that her bandmates will destroy her if they discover the golden patterns hidden beneath her skin. This personal conflict serves as a central theme, illustrating the battle between one’s public persona and their inner demons — the negative, nagging voices of self-doubt that the filmmakers represent through literal supernatural forces.\n\nBeyond the action, the film explores the nuances of cultural belonging through the character of Zoey, a Korean-American maknae who overcompensates for her fear of not being “Korean enough” as a Korean. Kang, who drew from her own heritage and childhood love of Korean mythology, emphasized that the film is rooted in the tradition of female shaman warriors who used music and dance to connect communities.\n\nUltimately, Kpop Demon Hunters explores how music and human empathy create a literal shield, known as the Golden Honmoon, against the darkness. The filmmakers aimed to show that while inner demons may never fully disappear, individuals can find power in their “true voices” and integrate the fractured parts of their identities rather than hiding them. Employing the blend of K-pop and ancient mythology, the film seeks to tell a universal story about the strength found in vulnerability and communal connection.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:12:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T20:29:22.971480"}

Miller’s wife Cami, played by Demi Moore, has stepped up to run M-Tex Oil, while Andy Garcia’s cartel boss Danny ‘Gallino’ Morrell is getting more involved in the oil business every day.\n\nThen there’s the Norris family; Ali Larter’s Angela is still giving Tommy grief, particularly at dinner, his son Cooper, played by Jacob Lofland, has found his own oil but is also now in business with the cartel, and his daughter Ainsley is getting ready to cheer at Texas Christian University. His father T.L, played by Sam Elliott, is also now in the picture and in the house, and is dealing with his own grief, following the death of his wife and Tommy’s mother.\n\nThe ten-part Paramount+ series, which was created by Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace, and is loosely based on the latter’s Boomtown podcast, runs through January 18. It has been renewed for season three.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nMoore, Elliott, Garcia and Larter sat down with Deadline after a screening of episodes five and six at the Pacific Design Center in LA to discuss the show and their characters.\n\nMoore joked that the first season of the show – where Cami is infrequently shown swimming laps in the pool – was like Where’s Waldo? for her. Season two felt like her first season.\n\n“To Taylor’s credit, this was all very intentional. He’s so smart about really creating the unexpected. No one would ever have thought if you had Jon Hamm that you would be letting him go,” she said. “This was my first chance to really step into the world. I was certainly not the light part of the of the show, dealing, obviously, with tremendous grief. For Cami, I always felt that losing the company would be losing the last piece of Monty that she has, and that it would be an ultimate failure,” Moore said.\n\nDemi Moore as Cami Miller in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nCami is thrown in at the deep end, having to deal with Monty’s financial peculiarities, while keeping the oil rigs pumping. Moore said working with Thornton on those nuances was a lot of fun. “[Tommy] is her lifeline and yet to go against the only anchor that she has – trusting her own instincts – led to a lot of juicy, spicy moments,” she added.\n\nMoore met a number of women that were in a similar situation to Cami. “Taylor and his wife Nicole [Muirbrook] set up a whole gathering with a group of ten women. These women have empowered femininity, they are extremely strong and fierce. It really gave me incredible insight into who he was looking for Cami to be.”\n\nLandman marked The Substance star’s first lead series role. “I had watched almost everything that Taylor had ever done, and I was so impressed with how he wrote his female characters. For a straight white man, that was really even more impressive, because they were so nuanced,” she added.\n\nLandman was Elliott’s second rodeo with Sheridan, having starred in 1883. Elliott had previously called the Yellowstone prequel role a “gift”. “I feel the same way about [Landman]. An opportunity to come and work with this cast and do Taylor’s words again with this crew… it’s just as good as it gets,” he said.\n\nSam Elliott and Billy Bob Thornton in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nThe Tombstone star’s character is dealing with the death of his wife, while figuring out his strained relationship with his son, a relationship that becomes more pronounced when he moves in with the family. Elliott enjoyed the back-and-forth with Thornton. “He’s a one of a kind guy, there’s no doubt about it. He’s a gift to all of us, I know that the company feels that way about him. He’s a lot of fun to work with. He comes ready,” he added.\n\nIt’s not clear how things are progressing between the landman and his corn dog-eating father, particularly after a contentious funeral dinner. “I’m new to the show for one thing, and I don’t really know where I’m headed,” Elliott joked.\n\nBut his character is still enjoying watching the spectacular West Texas sunsets, even if Elliott was staring at lights. “Texas really does have beautiful sunsets. That whole thing about talking about the heat and the lack of moisture in the air and the dust, it’s very true. That’s another thing about Taylor, he knows what he writes about. That’s what makes it fun for me,” he said.\n\nAli Larter as Angela Norris in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nT.L is invited to live with the Norris family by Angela, played by Larter, and he is soon roped into the fun of her themed-dinners, including this season a pirate dinner (which followed an incident with a $2800 mushroom at a previous dinner).\n\nLarter says throwing cacio e pepe at Thornton’s character was “very fun”. “You can just feel the connectivity that has happened this season, and especially with Sam being part of the cast now, and the depth of moments that he brings to the pirate dinner. There’s Ainsley and Angela up to their shenanigans, and then we get to look over and have Sam Elliott just looking at you, and it just brings a different moment to these scenes,” she said.\n\nAngela spends much of season two with Randolph’s Ainsley, helping some senior citizens get drunk and have fun, while they’re meant to be exercising. Angela’s relationship with Tommy is also unfolding.\n\n“It’s incredible coming back for a second season to begin with, because the first season we built our house and you spend a tremendous amount of time figuring out the dynamics of the family, the chemistry that everyone has,” she said. “Once the show is up and running, we’re kind of like a train barreling forward. So, when we came back this year, it was exciting to kind of look at where this relationship was going. It’s just like a complicated, messy relationship, and sometimes we’re laughing and sometimes we’re fighting, and it’s all in there. It’s all very alive, but it’s these two people really questioning if it’s possible for them to make this work, or if this is just kind of a pipe dream.”\n\nAngela also inadvertently gets Tommy to spend more time with Andy Garcia’s character, known only as Gallino when he turns up in the season one finale as a cartel boss saving Tommy.\n\nHe is now Danny Morrell, an investment banker with fingers in a lot of pies. “He has this kind of duality of life, he’s like Bruce Wayne and Batman,” said Garcia.\n\nAndy Garcia and Billy Bob Thornton in Landman (Emerson Miller/Paramount+)\n\nGarcia, who also compares Gallino to a member of the Corleone family, said that he told Thornton that he believes there’s some trouble ahead for the pair. “He’s going to slip in a spontaneous moment back to that other world. I [told Billy] that his character just happens to be with him when that goes down and he’s gonna hand him a gun and you’re going to have to step in it with me,” he added.\n\n“He’s an investment banker. He’s managing money for a lot of people. He’s managing the syndicate of the horses. He’s got his fingers everywhere. He has to be somebody that is able to navigate that with with a sense of purpose, a sense of class, a sense of people could have to trust him with their money and he has to be successful what he does.

The story, packed to the brim with 15 playable iconic characters, retells the events of the Marvel Comics crossover special of 2006’s Annihilation, which sees the galactic big bad Annihilus wage war amongst the cosmos through a series of mass invasions in hopes of one day ruling it all.\n\nSince its early December launch, Cosmic Invasion has been praised for combining lesser-known Marvel characters and properties with the more popular heroes that have launched a series of IP juggernauts in the MCU and beyond, making the story both casual fan-friendly and surprising for those who worship at the altar of true Marvel fandom. The game has also managed to set itself apart from other side-scrolling brawlers in its Cosmic Swap mechanic, which sees the player choose two characters when they start the game, allowing them to make a swap out any time during a fierce battle against Annihilus’ evil honchos.\n\nBelow, game director Frederic Gemus and Narrative Designer Yannick Belzil speak to Deadline about the inspiration behind the game, character designs and what players can expect next.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDEADLINE: I enjoyed seeing nuanced animations within these level designs of Destromundo, Fort Galactus and Savage Lands. I’m curious, what was the trickiest level design in general?\n\nFREDERIC GEMUS: The trickiest aspect was pretty much trying to figure out where we wanted to go because we’re big fans of the Marvel universe. So, figuring out which environments would be nice to visit and would also help build a story was a challenge. We tried to strike a mix of expected locales for the players and fresh, new places. And obviously, as a game director, one aspect that was important for me was making sure that all of these locations could have interesting gameplay aspects. You mentioned Destromundo, which has Lady Hellbender’s collection of critters from all across the universe. And for us, it was basically a cameo festival of what we can see in the background, but also what kind of surprises can occur from these giant creatures, like how they can interact with the players and reshuffle the battlefield.\n\nIt’s the same thing with Fort Galactus. We wanted to have this idea that we’re climbing toward liberating Galactus, but also, we wanted to have a stage in which we would have multiple encounters with the boss, in this case, the Silver Surfer. So, the whole feeling of fighting against the barricades of enemies with turrets, climbing elevators, and multiple fight sequences, all of these locations we wanted to translate into unique gameplays that would make the experience varied. That way, you get unique experiences so that Fort Galactus feels completely different from Wakanda, which is in the middle of an invasion, and there are a lot of things happening – you ride a train, you fight the claw. We wanted to maximize the gameplay we could get from each stage and then work with Yannick to ensure the adventure remained interesting.\n\nYANNICK BELZIL: When we chose these locales, we wanted to choose environments that felt like classic Marvel Comics locales that people would recognize and could associate with certain characters as well. For example, the first level is classic New York City, which you have in a lot of the Marvel Comics, and there’s a lot of the Daily Bugle stuff tied into Spider-Man. But when you’re in Genosha, you have an X-Men team level where you can fill Sentinels with it. Then you have Wakanda for Black Panther, and you have the Helicarrier for Shield, but that’s also in the lineage of Iron Man and Captain America. Then there’s the Blue Area of the Moon, which is a human settlement and also a classic location for several characters – especially Dark Phoenix.\n\nSo, for me, it was just trying to be like, “Oh, do I recognize that setting from only one screenshot from the comics?” And it was trying to create these really colorful, fun places that our artists would also have fun reinterpreting, and to make sure the player feels like they’re really traveling across the Marvel Universe and having a great big adventure.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: One of the biggest praises for the game is its educational element, which some people find in researching the deep cuts and underused locations and characters that appear. Like Phyla-Vell, Beta Ray Bill, and again, Destromundo. Can you talk a little more about how you chose these?\n\nGEMUS: Selecting 15 playable characters was a challenging thing to do. But at the same time, this still feels like it’s not enough, because we have such a love for these superheroes that we could have done a game with 36 of them and still felt there wasn’t enough. But one thing that was important for us was not necessarily to educate, but to surprise and bring players to some unfamiliar territories in a sense that, as you mentioned, there are some characters we haven’t seen many interpretations of – especially in games – like Nova. So, for us as designers and developers, it was fun to have a chance to help define how these characters could behave in an action game.\n\nBecause if you take Iron Man, for example, people expect Iron Man to be flying and using repulsors. There are abilities and ways to play Iron Man that come with the character, but we really thought it was fun and a great opportunity for us to help further develop how some characters, like Beta Ray Bill, could behave in an action game. Same thing with Phyla-Vell. These are characters we don’t often see, so in a way, we are also introducing them to new fans while helping develop the language across all Marvel games.\n\nDEADLINE: What was the hardest narrative challenge with all these new characters mingling in the game? Especially for those who don’t really have a connection in their own comics.\n\nBELZIL: The game is based on the comic book storyline Annihilation, which came out in 2006. When the Civil War event was happening on Earth in the comics, Annihilation was happening in space. And it’s a really cool story, but it’s more of a Game of Thrones, mature type of story that doesn’t have as many recognizable characters. Even the Guardians of the Galaxy, who became really popular from the movie, came from this comic. So, the big challenge was in figuring out how to make a version of this that is accessible for all ages because we want our games to be played by young kids, but also with their parents or just whole families in general. Fred and I decided that what if the Annihilation storyline was adapted inside the Spider-Man or X-Men cartoon of the ’90s? Then we figured our first six levels or so could be on Earth. You would get to travel a bit across Marvel Earth and encounter recognizable characters, and then they can go off into space together for further adventures and action.\n\nThen, the rest of the game was about how to parse out certain events from the comics, making sure they can happen in a manageable way in beat-’em-up form. At one point, Annihilus uses Galactus to destroy a planet, so the question becomes, how do we make that happen? We have to eventually build a manageable Galactus that can be in a level and do some traps and things like that. But those are more technical challenges for the rest of the staff, whereas I would go, “In level eight, Galactus should be there.”\n\nSome other fun challenges came from writing the dialogue and one-liners. There are one-liners that happen depending on which button the player presses. So, when you have 15 characters, and they say some fighting game type of thing when they execute a move, some characters came really easily, some were trickier, but the biggest thing is you don’t want them to repeat each other’s lines too much. That’s where the rubber really met the road for me, writing-wise, because there’s only so many things you can say to express something without repetition. This was especially true when it came to [the game mechanic of] swapping characters when they have to go, “Oh, up to you, so-and-so.” It was like, “Oh man, I have to find different versions of these characters calling each other.” And some of these characters don’t have relationships. Like, I don’t know if Storm has ever shared space with Cosmic Ghost Rider, so how do they feel about each other? I have to figure things like that out and give them unique one-liners.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: Fans are also responding positively to that character swap mechanic that you mentioned. Why do you think that is? And why was it important for you to build it into the game?\n\nGEMUS: [The idea started] with having 15 playable characters, and we wanted to make sure that they didn’t play the same. We wanted to make sure that Spider-Man does Spider-Man stuff. At the same time, Wolverine does all of the raging crazy things that Wolverine does, but that also means that we didn’t want it to give all abilities to everyone because if you look at classic beat-‘em-ups, for example, grabs and throws are going to be built most of the time within every character themselves. Still, we wanted to make sure to really focus on the differences and strengths of all the superheroes; it would be better to focus on the play style of each character through the lineup. That also meant that we got a bit worried at one point that maybe it would be overwhelming for the players to actually be able to pick someone because maybe they’d be like, “Oh, I’m going to pick Storm, but what if there is a moment where I wish I had She-Hulk with me or I’m going to play Iron Man, but maybe Wolverine would be better suited for that sequence.” So, we thought that by combining two characters together, you would be able to basically build one and have the advantages of both.\n\nThen, we thought about how to interact. At first, our system was a bit more complex, where you had to request that the other characters come in and perform specific actions. Then we realized that, since our target audience is so large, we wanted to make it a more accessible game, so we created a simple button system that lets the game infer the context of what you’re in and pick the right action. This was the funnest version of that complex system. For example, if an enemy grabs your hero and you’re stuck there, swapping means your second character will come in and free you with an attack. We thought that this was quite cool and lived up to the Marvel fantasy, because when you look at Marvel Comics, it’s always heroes teaming up. So, that system was so important to us because we wanted the player to feel like they are in a team of superheroes against Annihilus, who is basically alone and wants to remain alone in the end and destroy the whole universe so that he can just be the last one standing.\n\nBELZIL: I think the reason why people respond is just the mere sensation of being able to play with two action figures at once, which is really useful and fun in a primal way. Like, you get your two favorite heroes, and you can use them over and over and automate moves by having them chime in. There’s something about the fun of this time-honored Marvel Comics tradition to have characters meet up for the first time and then have them team up to go against a larger villain.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion Tribute Games\n\nDEADLINE: I’d be remiss not to bring up the fan conversation around Silver Surfer’s butt. What say you? Apparently, the gamers are saying it is very round, fit and caked up.\n\nBELZIL: He is. I feel like he has an accurately depicted toned surfer physique. In fact, I think we might have been asked to tone down some of the pronunciation of his butt cheeks, but they still survived in the screen images, not in the gameplay [sequences]. So, the butt remains prominent and important, where you can see it. Silver Surfer worked hard for that butt, and we’re glad people can enjoy it.\n\nDEADLINE: What can players expect from the future? Any further additions to the game to look out for?\n\nGEMUS: Right now, we are on the other side of launch, meaning that we’re still looking at players’ reception. We’re also fixing bugs and trying to identify what needs improvement. It’s easy when you ship a game and have a team of 20 testers, vs launching the game and now there are 100,000s of people playing it. So, there are definitely some surprises that we are working hard on, but for now, this is pretty much our focus. We are looking at, do players love the game? Do they want more? Do they have hopes for extra content? We are listening, but we don’t have anything to announce at the moment.\n\n\n\nBELZIL: Look, we’ve seen every comment section become a suggestion box for future characters. And like they say on Pandora, “We see you.” But also, between when the game was actually done and when it came out, it’s not that long a stretch. So, it’s not like we have secret DLC in our back pocket that we’re waiting to spring on people. It’s exciting that people really want more, and they want their favorite characters as well. It’s fun to see the enthusiasm for the game and that they want more. So, we hope to deliver on that someday, but for now we’re just sitting back and enjoying it.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:11:23 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T21:25:06.258783"}

Friday-Sunday are free and clear of holidays and are pure moviegoing days. The worst for distributors is when Christmas Eve, a slow day, and Christmas Day fall on the Friday-Sunday span. That’s a wrench to turnstiles.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n20th Century Studios’ Avatar: Fire and Ash will continue to conquer with an estimated $75M 4-day take; $55M second 3-day weekend, -38%, from its $89.1M opening. Yesterday, the James Cameron directed, and Cameron, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Josh Friedman & Shane Salerno story by threequel crossed $398.7M worldwide. Monday domestic was $13.3M at 3,800 locations, -18% from Avatar: Way of Water‘s first Monday of $16.2M. Fire and Ash‘s total U.S./Canada running cume is $102.5M. That running cume for Fire and Ash is about $10M less than the combined first 4-day domestic totals of Mufasa and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 a year ago (which totaled $112.5M). Audience score for the Cameron Na’vi movie on Rotten Tomatoes remains at 91%.\n\nSony looks to be reviving comedy as its meta take of 1997’s Anaconda is looking at second place with $20M+ at 3,400 locations. There are previews starting tomorrow at 12noon for the Jack Black-Paul Rudd movie with Thursday showtimes at 2,900 locations starting as early as 9AM. So far, 39 critics don’t like it on Rotten Tomatoes at 39%. However, Anaconda is the only place for laughs this Christmas. First choice and unaided awareness for the $45M net production is best with guys under 25.\n\nUniversal Pictures International / Everett Collection\n\nThird, fourth, fifth and sixth will be a toss between Focus Features’ new Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson Neil Diamond tribute movie, Song Sung Blue, A24’s wide expansion of Josh Safdie’s Marty Supreme (already at $1M+ in six NYC and LA locations), and the second weekends of Angel Studio’s David and Lionsgate’s The Housemaid. All are eyeing $12M-mid-teens apiece over four days. Marty Supreme and Housemaid could overindex.\n\nSong Sung Blue from filmmaker Craig Brewer and produced by Brewer, John David and John Fox, will open in 2,400 locations on Christmas with previews starting at 2PM on Christmas Eve. Jackman and Hudson play real-life Wisconsin couple Mike and Claire Sardina who fell in love via their music impersonators’ acts. Their tale — a roller coaster. You gotta see the movie to find out what happens. Critics are 73% certified fresh. Hudson is up for Best Female in a Feature Comedy/Musical at the Golden Globes. Best unaided awareness is with men and women over 25, on par with last year’s A Complete Unknown and slightly higher than Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.\n\nThe Timothée Chalamet period dramedy Marty Supreme stands at 95% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and is best with men over 25 in first choice and unaided awareness. Previews start tomorrow around 12 noon. Anticipation is building especially in the wake of Chalamet’s recent viral stunt of standing atop The Sphere in Las Vegas and the Empire State Building which clocked 1.3M views on Instagram (I hear he truly braved this like a pro — he’s not a fan of heights). Social media reach for the Chalamet movie is 197M across TikTok, Instagram, X, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which isn’t far from Saltburn‘s 214M reach.\n\nChalamet’s Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown got a pure 5-day launch last Christmas, Wednesday-Sunday, grossing $23.2M; pic’s 3-day was $11.6M. It was great counterprogramming over the holiday ending its run at $75M.\n\nRelishMix says that pre-wide release social media stats on Marty Supreme are running 47% above high concept drama genre norms boosted by Chalamet’s 21.5M fans, Tyler the Creator’s 39M, Gwyneth Paltrow’s 15.2M followers, Kevin O’Leary’s 6.5M, Fran Drescher at 2.8M and Odessa A’Zion at 2M.\n\nSays RelishMix, “Convo runs positive for Marty Supreme when you cut through the static and lock onto the core fandom, who are here for Timmy, Tyler and Safdie magic. Devotion fires fast with lines like ‘I’m so excited about this film, I would watch anything with Timmy in it’ and ‘Clicked for Tim, stayed for Tyler, I’ll go to theaters since Tyler is in it.’ Table-tennis lifers show up strong, saying ‘As a table tennis lover, can’t wait to see Marty Supreme hit the big screen’ and ‘As someone whose main sport has been table tennis since I was a little kid, I have to watch this movie.’ Awards chatter peaks early with ‘I smell Oscars’ and ‘Oscars incoming, lighten up people.’ Fans brand the package prestige, from ‘A24 + Chalamet + Safdie = excellent’ to ‘Omg this looks brilliant.’ Even comps land flattering, with ‘Totally getting Forrest Gump vibes here and I’m in’ and ‘It’s Bob Dylan playing ping pong.'”\n\nYesterday, Zootopia 2 was No. 2 at the Monday B.O. with $4.3M at 3,540 and a running total of $287.4M. Remember, we told you that there were 81% K-12 out and 91% colleges on break.\n\nLionsgate’s Housemaid was $3.4M at 3,015 sites, -35% from Sunday, in third with a running four-day of $22.4M.\n\nAngel Studio’s David at 3,118 made $3.3M, -42% from Sunday, for a running cume of $25.2M.\n\nParamount’s SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants at 3,557 sites is up to $18.4M after four days with Monday taking in $2.8M, -34% from Sunday.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:00:51 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T21:25:06.560109"}

It also played in Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight section.\n\nA24 landed the indie dramatic comedy in Park City and released it in theaters in late June. It has since landed a Critics Choice nomination for the original screenplay, while Victor, maybe best known for their role in Showtime’s Billions, picked up a Best Actress – Drama nom from the Golden Globes. They are also up for Best Picture, Best Screenplay and Best Director at the Indie Spirits.\n\nIn the pic, which Victor wrote during the Covid lockdown in a Maine cabin, centers on Agnes, who we meet living in a quaint but somewhat isolated home near a New England college — they same place where she and her college roommate Lydie (Naomi Ackie, a Spirits nominee for Supporting Performer) lived when they were students. It seems Lydie and everyone else from that time has moved on, while Agnes has stayed put, on the verge of landing a big professor job in her old English department. It’s slowly revealed the reason Agnes seems stuck to everyone else: it’s the “bad thing,” being sexually assaulted by her thesis mentor (Louis Cancelmi), during her last year of school.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n(The act itself is never shown; rather, Agnes emerges from the event with what happened now simply a part of her. It’s a stunningly effective device.)\n\nThe film’s story is shown in several non-linear segments, and uses plenty of gallows humor to bring the reader into Agnes’ mind-set, skipping back and forth from before, during and after the moment she can’t forget and can’t get past, living with her like a specter (the college job she takes replaces her attacker, who fled after the incident; she even takes over his office). It takes Agnes’ ride-or-die buddy Lydie (now living in New York and having a baby) and a caring, somewhat smitten neighbor (Lucas Hedges) to help her maybe find a way through.\n\n“I found myself writing the film I felt I needed when I found myself in a similar crisis to Agnes,” Victor says about the script, which they say didn’t substantially change beyond the first draft. “I didn’t want to write about violence or assault specifically as much as I wanted to explore how a person heals. What interested me most was digging into that feeling of being stuck, seeing people you love moving on, while you’re still caught thick in the bad thing that happened to you. I started out writing this for the person I used to be.”\n\nThe film was produced in part by Barry Jenkins, Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak’s Pastel, which took Victor under its wing and and encouraged them to not only write and star but direct.\n\nRead the screenplay below.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:04:20 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-23T22:25:39.108986"}

However, for one Diddy accuser there is nothing fun, funny or insightful about the comedian’s comments.\n\n“His latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs,” Jonathan Hay told Deadline.\n\n“Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once ‘missed his chance’ to have sex with her,” the producer added of the part of the December 19 dropped Unstoppable where the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor winner discussed allegations against Combs and his so-called “freak-offs” with the Me & U singer.” Such humor doesn’t just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it,” Hay adds.\n\nREAD ALL OF JONATHAN HAY’S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS BELOW\n\nLast month, the LA County Sheriff’s Department announced it has opened an investigation into claims of a 2020 sexual battery by Combs against music producer Hay. There was also a 2021 incident where Diddy said a kidnapped and hooded Hay was being a “snitch,” and allegedly ordered everyone else out of the room and then tried “to force plaintiff to perform oral copulation on Combs, while plaintiff’s head was still covered.”\n\nDiddy’s team responded to at the time to the claims in redacted filings by Hay by saying their client “categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone.”\n\nIf Combs is charged out of the LASD probe and found guilty, he could be sentenced to several years in California state prison. Right now, serving a four-year sentence in a low-security facility in New Jersey for being found guilty on July 2 of two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution in his sex trafficking and RICO trial, an appealing Combs isn’t expected to be free until mid-2028.\n\nToday, as the LASD probe continues according to law enforcement sources, Hay was vehement in his claims and criticism of “my favorite comedian of all time” Chappelle’s POV on Combs and his alleged actions of sexual violence and exploitation.\n\n“As someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren’t abstract punchlines, they’re relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me.”\n\nNow, it’s no secret that Chappelle likes to punch out for outrage’s sake. In the suddenly released Unstoppable, the comedian tells a riotous DC crowd in the tight 75-minute special of why he decided to perform at a comedy fest in Saudi Arabia despite the Kingdom’s 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, plus his take on reactions to Charlie Kirk’s death and trans rights (again).\n\nChappelle also admits a bias for Combs based on the Bad Boy Records founder leaping to his physical defense when an attacker stormed the stage while the comic was performing at the Hollywood Bowl in 2022. “It’s not that I think Puff is right, but when I got attacked in L.A. at the Hollywood Bowl, people forget Puff was the guy that tackled my attacker,” Chappelle tells the Unstoppable crowd. “He saved my life.”\n\n“That’s a hard dude to be mad at after that.”\n\nStill, it’s not all high fives as Chappelle details a visit to Diddy’s LA home not long afterwards that went sideways towards the end – though the comic didn’t realize it at the time.\n\n“I didn’t see none of the stuff they said in that trial,” Chappelle starts off. “House is clean, traction on the floor, nothing slippery,” he notes in a clear reference to the prodigious baby oil use that Combs was tainted with in testimony over his alleged sexual abuse of Ventura and other women with male escorts.\n\n“Puff started swirling his drink like this and he goes, ‘So Dave, what are you into?’” Chappelle then said after a bit of a chat between the duo. continues. “You know me, I was like, ‘I don’t know …books, video games.’ I didn’t know that was my big chance to f*ck Cassie.”\n\nLater, Chappelle swings it all around, sorta.\n\n“Cassie is a gangster,” he states of Combs’ ex, who spent days and days on the stand in a NYC federal courtroom earlier this year telling a jury of the years of drugs, violence, rape, multi-million dollar settlements and more from Diddy – testimony that was often backed up by videos and photos. “She did something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. She had to testify about her sex life. That’s tough.”\n\nRepresentatives for Chappelle did not respond to Deadline’s request for comment on Hay’s statement. Netflix did respond, but had no comment.\n\nAs of today, Chappelle’s self-proclaimed “no-holds-barred special” The Unstoppable is the Number #1 TV show on the streamer. That top spot is the same number #1 that the Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson produced Sean Combs; The Reckoning held just a few weeks ago\n\nREAD JONATHAN HAY’S STATEMENT ON CHAPPELLE & COMBS HERE:\n\nDave Chappelle has long been my favorite comedian of all time, a master of sharp wit and unflinching social commentary. Yet his latest Netflix special, The Unstoppable…, left me deeply unsettled with its repeated expressions of support for Sean “Diddy” Combs. Throughout the show, Chappelle frames Combs’ recent Mann Act conviction as an example of racially motivated persecution, drawing parallels to the legendary boxer Jack Johnson, the very figure around whom the law was originally crafted to criminalize his relationship with a white woman across state lines.\n\nThe issue here is glaring: Combs was charged under the Mann Act for sex trafficking women of color, not for the interracial dynamics that fueled Johnson’s targeting. This mischaracterization overlooks the gravity of the allegations against Combs, which center on the exploitation and trafficking of women of color. Even more troubling, Chappelle attempts to downplay the horrific situation involving Cassie Ventura, turning her documented physical assault into fodder for jokes, while casually admitting he once “missed his chance” to have sex with her. Such humor doesn’t just minimize her trauma; it normalizes it.\n\nAs someone who has personally endured sexual assault at the hands of Combs, these moments aren’t abstract punchlines, they’re relentless triggers that reopen wounds for survivors like me. The pain never fully fades, and hearing a global icon like Chappelle defend an assailant while millions laugh along only amplifies the isolation. Imagine if Chappelle himself, or his sons Sulayman and Ibrahim, were victims of violent sexual assault. How would he feel watching a comedian publicly champion their abuser, turning their suffering into worldwide entertainment? It’s not comedy; it’s callous. We deserve better from the artists we admire.\n\nAs a survivor still carrying the weight of what happened, moments like these in Chappelle’s special only deepen my resolve and make me all the more eager for the ongoing criminal investigations by both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department into the allegations against Sean Combs, CJ Wallace, and Willie Mack to deliver the accountability I deserve.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:18:10 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T02:10:55.545803"}

The announcement was wince-inducing for National Geographic, which saw its prime contender go unrecognized, even though the film in question had just won the IDA Award for Best Feature Documentary. Likewise, HBO Documentary Films came up short with one of its top hopefuls – a documentary directed by a famed actress. HBO, however, was rewarded with recognition for The Alabama Solution, the investigative documentary directed by Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman.\n\nEye-opening for Oscar doc watchers — the quantity of films lacking U.S. distribution that overcame that barrier to earn a place on the feature shortlist, among them Holding Liat, Seeds, Yanuni and Coexistence, My Ass! Ridley, an Oscar winner himself (12 Years a Slave) and a member of the Academy, praises the doc branch for embracing Seeds, but he expresses outrage over the omission of a film directed by Davis Guggenheim and Nyle DiMarco.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“Really? Really?” Ridley says with incredulity regarding that snub.\n\nOne film had to cut through rocks to get onto the shortlist. Also in the mix — a documentary from a filmmaker who won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature just two years ago, and another by a filmmaker who earned her Academy Award a decade ago.\n\nWe also put the short documentaries shortlist under the microscope. Some prominent filmmakers were recognized there including Joshua Seftel, Ondi Timoner and Jay Rosenblatt. The remarkable Geeta Gandbhir made the shortlist for an acclaimed feature she directed and for short documentary she co-directed, an impressive two-fer.\n\nThat’s on the new episode of Doc Talk, hosted by Ridley and Carey, Deadline’s senior documentary editor.

She is one of 13 survivors of the global shift known as The Joining, which has fused almost all of humanity into a single shared consciousness with whom she’s eager to merge. A special gas has been delivered via plane, and she happily inhales it, briefly convulsing in a state of hive-mind bliss. She’s one of the Others now, and they all evacuate the village expeditiously. One down, 12 to go.\n\nIn the episode, titled “La Chica o El Mundo” (“The Girl or the World”), a bloodied Manousos (Carlos Manuel Vesga) completes his death-defying journey from Paraguay to New Mexico. And Carol (Rhea Seehorn) is playing house with Zosia (Karolina Wydra). With the rest of the unaffected living in delusion and shooting the shit on weekly Zoom meetings, Manousos may be Carol’s last hope at (in his view) saving humanity. But while he’s been trekking through the Darién Gap and teaching himself English, Carol’s been playing croquet and sleeping with the enemy.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe two “Old-Schoolers,” as the cast and crew of “Pluribus” refer to them, don’t exactly get along. Manousos dumps Carol’s phone through a drain grate, and they bicker about whether the Others are, in fact, people. Carol’s situationship with Zosia has softened her views on the 7 billion people stricken with the mind virus, so much so that she threatens Manousos with a shotgun as he attempts to cure one of them with radio frequencies.\n\nEventually, Carol chooses the titular girl over the world, and she and Zosia embark on globe-trotting adventures, including a luxurious ski trip. The honeymoon phase comes to a screeching halt, however, when Zosia lets it slip that the Others have found a way to potentially convert Carol into one of them, against her will. It was previously established that they would need her stem cells, but their biological imperative prevents them from retrieving them via injection without her consent. Now, Zosia admits, the Others have discovered eggs that Carol had frozen with her late wife, Helen. Through a tricky, months-long process, they hope to convert the eggs into stem cells, which they could use to share their happiness with Carol.\n\nThis betrayal makes Carol go nuclear — literally. Remember when the Others told her they’d give her an atom bomb if she asked for one? Well, now they have. Back in Albuquerque, she and Manousos make a pact to save the world by any means necessary.\n\nIn two interviews, Seehorn and “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan, director-writer-EP Gordon Smith and writer-EP Alison Tatlock break down those finale twists and reveal their original, less explosive Season 1 ending.\n\nA major revelation in this episode is that the Others have Carol’s frozen eggs, which they can turn into stem cells, which they can use to convert her into one of them. Previously, they said they would need her consent — what changed?\n\nGILLIGAN: Well, literally, the Others are very lawyerly. The specific question that was put to them — which they answered via signboard on that hotel casino in Las Vegas — was, “Is it true you need our stem cells?” And the answer was yes. Then Carol asked, “Is it further true that to collect those stem cells, you would need to stick a needle in my hip?” They were very cautious about how it was phrased. It’s like in Episode 2, when one of the characters says, “So, you are vegetarians?” There’s a little pause, and then Zosia says, “We would prefer to be vegetarians, yes.” It’s very “Perry Mason”–esque, very lawyerly in how they answer questions. But nothing literally changed.\n\nSMITH: We talked about the possibility that maybe they learned something new about Carol’s eggs. They said at the very beginning, “We’re trying to figure out how to turn you.” And then they learned how to turn her. They can learn things.\n\nTATLOCK: They don’t need consent to change people, of course, because the premise of the show — right from the pilot — is that they change everybody as quickly as possible, first by kissing and eventually by planes flying overhead. If they could put their special spice in the water, they absolutely would. What they do need is consent to intrude upon somebody’s physical being. So they couldn’t take her stem cells directly. But if her stem cells already exist — or if the eggs, which aren’t stem cells, can be converted through a tricky process into stem cells — and they’re already outside of her body, they’ll do it.\n\nSo, it’s still the case that they cannot lie, but they can withhold information?\n\nGILLIGAN: They can mislead you all the live-long day. Absolutely. We were talking about “Perry Mason” — the Raymond Burr version from the ’50s. The famous moment in that show is when someone says, “What if I told you the killer was on the street at 3?” And later in the episode someone says, “You told me the killer was on the street at 3,” and Raymond Burr says, “No, I said, what if I told you.” That’s the key to it. For us, with these folks, they’re very lawyerly.\n\nSMITH: They can lie by omission.\n\nLet’s talk about Zosia’s betrayal of Carol.\n\nSEEHORN: I don’t think the betrayal could have been larger. Carol was living in a willing delusion. But there was always a part of her still in there. So, by the time Zosia says, “We stole your eggs,” it’s like: the eggs that represent the future that I wanted with my wife, who is now dead, partially because of you? And I also told you implicitly that I don’t want this, and you’re doing it behind my back? It’s also that horrible feeling of feeling like a fool for letting your guard down for a second. For Carol, it’s magnified: How did I dare think I could have love and joy? On top of that, this massive clock is now ticking about how long Carol has before they’re going to turn her.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nWhat is Zosia’s motive for kissing Carol in Episode 8?\n\nTATLOCK: I think the motive behind the kiss, from the Others’ point of view, is to offer Carol something that would bring her comfort and pleasure and help her forget her troubles for a little while. I think it’s an act of love in their mind. Now, watching it, you could say it’s an act of manipulation, or maybe even worse. But from their point of view, they feel like they’re giving her something she longed for but wasn’t able to fully take for herself, and that it would help her get through a hard, transitional chapter in her life — the chapter before being changed into one of them.\n\nTo what extent is Carol enamored by Zosia?\n\nSEEHORN: Enamored is a great way to put it. I think she is sincerely enamored by her. The kiss is something Carol didn’t even know how much she needed. Even when she runs down the driveway to hug her [in Episode 6], I think Carol is profoundly shaken and surprised by how much she — who used to be such a misanthrope and crave being alone all the time — could be pushed to the limits of realizing, I do need people. I need companionship. Voluntary isolation is a much different thing than involuntary isolation. She’s in an extraordinarily vulnerable and fragile place in that scene.\n\nAs to whether the Others are “manipulating” Carol, I suppose every action can be justified by, “We just want to make you happy, Carol.” But at what point does making Carol happy mean the same thing as, “We’re going to give you everything you want so that we see eye to eye on things?” It’s not lost on me that Episode 8 is titled “Charm Offensive”!\n\nGILLIGAN: You’re definitely asking the right questions. What it boils down to is two people trying desperately to change each other. It’s a very dramatic set of circumstances, and I think about how this plays out in relationships all the time — people who love someone but also want to change them. You hear about that all the time: “We’re going to get married, and I’m going to change them.”\n\nSEEHORN: How do we separate altruism and manipulation? Most acts of kindness and love do have a payoff, even if it’s just feeling good about yourself. Even unconditional love might be a child you have a responsibility to raise, or a fear of being alone, or a desire to receive love back. I honestly don’t know the answer, and I haven’t asked Vince to definitively tell me. I know he’s thrilled that it’s open to interpretation — whether the Others are being manipulative, whether they’re being sincere, and whether those two things can coexist.\n\nWhy does Carol threaten Manousos to stop experimenting on the Other? She’s come a long way from how she felt at the beginning of the series.\n\nSEEHORN: From the very beginning, as angry as Carol was — screaming at them, “You murdered my wife, I want nothing to do with you!” — she always felt horrible about physically harming any of them. She always showed extreme guilt, even to the degree that she was willing to suppress her rage in order not to harm them. She even asks them at one point, when she’s in Spain, “Can you give me anything to make me stop doing this?” And that’s early on, when she still hates them.\n\nNow, she has feelings for Zosia that are individualized, which illustrates to Carol that these are humans with a neurological shift, and they should not be harmed. So when she sees Manousos screaming at that guy shaking on the couch, she knows that not only could it cause Zosia to go into cardiac arrest, it could also mean killing millions of people all over the world again. And it infuriates her that he can’t see any other way. At the same time, the audience knows she’s being extraordinarily defensive, because this guy can see through her. He knows she’s lying about why they came back and why she cares [about them] more now.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nIt seems like a lot of her conversation with Manousos is informed by the last couple days she spent with Zosia. I’m not sure she would have said the Others are “not evil” even a couple episodes ago.\n\nSEEHORN: Fair point. The romantic part of it and feeling like she actually has a companion has muddied that. Some people have asked me if the Others leaving Carol in that extreme state of isolation was a manipulative tool to make her need them. I don’t know the answer to that, and I hadn’t even thought about it. I thought they were trying to protect themselves. But whatever the result is, Carol would absolutely see them coming back as an act of compassion. Many things have happened that make her feel like these people deserve compassion. They helped me. They put my Sprouts back. They made sure I was taken care of. Even when they couldn’t stand me, they brought me anything I wanted. And when I needed companionship, they gave it to me.\n\nWe see the Other drive away, seemingly unfazed by Manousos’ experiment. Just for the record: It did not work, correct? There is no way he has been converted back?\n\nGILLIGAN: I never even thought of that.\n\nSMITH: He’s not converted back. If he were converted back, Zosia would be doing something else. I don’t think she would be walking out to leave Albuquerque. There would be a four-alarm fire on their hands.\n\nTATLOCK: He would be very disoriented. He just looks placid and pleasant.\n\nGILLIGAN: Rick! That’s his name. Rick just gets in his Prius and leaves.\n\nSurveillance is something Carol and Manousos bicker about. Manousos is more afraid than Carol about being spied on via digital devices. To what extent is that reasonable, or is he just paranoid?\n\nTATLOCK: We know there are drones. We’ve seen the drones come in and out to deliver things. We know in the beginning Carol says, “Are you spying on me?” So, Manousos is not entirely wrong to suspect that they’re being watched. There are many reasons to believe someone is keeping an eye on them.\n\nGILLIGAN: They basically have admitted that.\n\nWhy does Manousos start speaking to Zosia after months of staunchly resisting the Others? I mean, he decides to cross the Darién Gap so that he doesn’t have to interact with them.\n\nGILLIGAN: I think it’s his interaction with Carol. Carol says to him, “Have you tried just talking to them?,” which is rich coming from her, because in Episode 2 the character Laxmi says to Carol, “Have you not asked these people questions? Why have you not asked them what it’s like?” And now the shoe is on the other foot. Seven episodes later, Carol is saying, “Why don’t you just talk to these people?” And I think he takes her at her word. He tries it. And because he might be starting to feel like, I don’t know if I’m going to get straight answers from this woman whom I came 6,000 kilometers to talk to.\n\nTATLOCK: Yeah, he becomes suspicious of Carol, so he decides to try a different tack, which is to get information about Carol from Zosia.\n\nYou have Chekhov’s gun in this season. You also have Chekhov’s atom bomb. When was it apparent that the nuke was going to be a major crux of this season?\n\nGILLIGAN: Surprisingly late.\n\nSMITH: A day or two into shooting the episode was when that became clear.\n\nTATLOCK: It was not the ending we broke together in the writers’ room. We adjusted it later, which is a bit unusual.\n\nGILLIGAN: We had an ending that was perfectly good. It would have been satisfying but not as satisfying. And we got a note. You know the old thing about how executives always have stupid notes. Actually, Apple and Sony said, “Is there an even better ending to be had?” And we listened, and I’m really glad they gave us that note. It made for a better ending.\n\nTATLOCK: We had planted the seed in Episode 3 but we didn’t have an exact plan to pay it off in this way. It opened an opportunity to do that.\n\nCan you share the ending you originally had planned?\n\nSMITH: It was similar to that ending. It was more subtle. Carol secretly forges a pact with Manousos, slips him a note and is perhaps going to play double agent. There wasn’t as much of a flag planted, like: “Nope, I’m not doing this. This relationship with the Others can’t continue.”\n\nGILLIGAN: Other than the atom bomb not being part of it, it was not open warfare. It was, I’m going to continue to be a double agent. It was covert. Even before we got the note, we thought, Is this the most satisfying way to go? Do we buy this?\n\nWhy do they give her the atom bomb? I know it’s established early on, but if they’ll go against her wishes with the stem cells, why won’t they go against her wishes with the nuke?\n\nGILLIGAN: Good question. They contain multitudes. It’s this constant tension between wanting to make her happy [and protecting themselves]. As horribly destructive as one atom bomb is… obviously, they don’t want her to set it off. But if she did — no pun intended — one atom bomb would not be the end of the world.\n\nTATLOCK: There are 7 billion of them populating the entire Earth, so they are trying to placate her as best as they can, and they know they have the upper hand.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nWhat would Earth look like if the Others converted everybody? In the opening scene of the finale, they immediately leave the village after converting Kusimayu, because they have no reason to be there. And those bodies have no reason to even be with each other anymore — that family has no purpose. In other words, who are the Others without the Old-Schoolers?\n\nSMITH: In Episode 8, we hear about the dish they’re building, so we know they have some sense of purpose. We’re not 100% clear on what that looks like, or what the boundaries around that are, but we do think that it might be a nice world.\n\nTATLOCK: It’s a peaceful world. They’re a collective, and they are entirely pragmatic, so there’s no need anymore for them to recreate culture or to play pretend. If there’s no more Old-Schoolers left, they don’t need to do what they’re doing for Mr. Diabaté [Samba Schutte] or for Kusimayu. So, they are living as efficiently as possible and at peace with each other and with the Earth, but with no attachment.\n\nGILLIGAN: The perfect reaction to the show is for the viewer to decide for themself: Is this paradise or is this hell? You could watch, for instance, the way the Others walk away from that Peruvian village and say, “Oh my God, this is a nightmare. Suddenly everybody is cold to one another.” But if you look really closely, they’re not actually cold to each other. They’re just there. It’s like all the cells in my body — I’m not paying attention to each one, but they make up one whole organism. They are happy, I think. But then again, is that paradise, or is it hell?\n\nWhy is it important that Carol is not necessarily always “likable” — or the perfect hero?\n\nSEEHORN: She is a reluctant hero, to say the least. She definitely was not hoping to lead the revolution, but she feels like nobody else will. Her behavior is flawed because she is an everyman who is faced with an insane circumstance. She is not heightened. She is in a fantastical world, but she herself is utterly realistic, emotionally. What would you do if you found yourself feeling like you were in a dystopian, apocalyptic nightmare? I’d rather watch somebody misbehave in that moment, as long as it’s truthful. Her vulnerability when she finds out that the other English speakers are all hanging out without her on weekly Zooms — that’s so human. We’ve all been there. I have been excluded from certain lunch tables in the cafeteria. That hurts, even when the big picture is much bigger.\n\nI also find her suppression of rage very interesting to explore. I know she’s impulsive. I know she shouldn’t be screaming or saying some of the things she says. But I also know that in my real life, many women I know should not be suppressing their anger and rage as much as they are. They should not be lowering their voices or trying so hard to be palatable. Those are flaws, too.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T08:36:53.427815"}

She also launched an interview podcast, In the Makeup Chair, which features conversions with guests about beauty, business and behind-the-scenes life.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nHer new agency, NAO Talent, was quietly set up in September 2025 by creator-manager duo Amelia Olivia and Niamh Plunkett. They formed the business out of Olivia’s own creator career, after identifying a gap in the market for a management company that approaches careers and dealmaking from both a creator and commercial perspective.\n\nOlivia is a well-established content creator who also began her career in the beauty industry. She has grown a community of more than 1.5 million subscribers across platforms.\n\n“NAO Talent really was born out of our own lived experience,” Olivia told Deadline. “As my career as a creator grew, my manager Niamh and I realised that creators are effectively building full-scale businesses, but most structures were still treating them like short-term marketing channels.\n\n“We’d gone from small gifting deals to global partnerships and billboards and it became clear that what moved the needle wasn’t luck, it was strategy, alignment and having someone in your corner who genuinely understands the creative and commercial sides of this industry. We launched NAO Talent together because there was a real gap for creator-first management that helps talent build sustainable, fulfilling careers – not just chase the next campaign.”\n\nNAO’s co-founders believe the creator economy has evolved to the point they need proper infrastructure and well-being support to handle their newly-found fame. “Young creators are now founders, storytellers and cultural voices, but they’re often navigating brand deals, pricing, legal, creative direction and community management alone,” said Plunkett.\n\nWe hear NAO plans to unveil several new talent signings in early 2026.\n\n“We’re interested in building careers,” added Olivia. “That means thoughtful partnerships, long-term ambassadorships, creative collaborations and brand work that makes sense for the talent and their audience.\n\n“We’re also intentional about helping creators build equity and IP – whether that’s through product, media, licensing or other IP-driven opportunities. There’s a huge shift happening where creators aren’t just promoting brands, they’re co-creating them, and we want our talent to be at the forefront of that. Ultimately, we prioritise deals that feel aligned, strategic and sustainable – where creators are seen as partners with perspective, not just content producers with reach.”\n\nCreator-focused agencies are popping in numbers as the industry evolves, with more and more stars who broken through on television shows signing with the newer companies or traditional agencies such as Curtis Brown, CAA or United Agents.\n\n“At the core of it, we just wanted to take everything we’d learned – the wins, the mistakes, the messy middle – and use it to help other creators’ build incredible careers that they’re proud of, from real, lived experience,” said Olivia.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T10:28:38.191173"}

After a coffee and a chat, she there and then offered him a role in Goodbye June, her directing debut that streams on Netflix from today following a limited theatrical run.\n\nA few days prior to their meeting, Heartstopper actor Akinade, acclaimed for his virtuosity on stage, was on the top deck of a London bus when his agent called with the news The Holiday, The Reader and Mildred Pierce star was directing a film and wanted to meet. “I said, ‘How the fuck does she know who I am?’”\n\nHis agent then asked if he’d like to know who he could be acting opposite. The names of Helen Mirren, Toni Collette, Timothy Spall, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Winslet herself were reeled off.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“‘What the fuck is going on?,’” he recalls spurting.\n\nThe film, written by Joe Anders, the son of Winslet and Sam Mendes, is about a matriarch of the family dying at Christmastime. Winslet wanted Akinade to play Angel, the cancer ward nurse caring for Mirren’s June, the title character, while her husband, their four children and grandchildren wait by her bedside.\n\nThe venue of the meeting was the Soho Hotel. As Akinade ran to the loo, Winslet came into view. “I thought, ‘Jesus. This is a woman I have watched since I was about 12 years old, and she’s just here in the flesh – so warm and lovely and funny and honest.’ We had coffee. She spoke about the film, spoke about herself, what she’d been up to, and then she said: ‘Well, listen, I want you to do it. There’s nobody else I’m seeing. I’m not asking anybody else.’”\n\nIt was agreed and an offer was made. Winslet then suggested he accompany her on auditioning some children for the pic, and even reading with them. They left the hotel together and Akinade recalls finding the situation “insane,” saying of Winslet, “She has an air about her that’s just very easy and breezy – I sort of liken it to how Denzel Washington and Pauletta Washington handle themselves. They’re both very famous people, but then they just get about in a way that means people aren’t flocking or hounding them.”\n\nAkinade took notice. “I do think it’s something that you cultivate,” he says. “You either choose to cultivate anonymity or you choose to cultivate fanfare.”\n\nNigerian roots\n\nAkinade was born in Liverpool, but when he was a baby he and his Nigerian parents went to Nigeria, returning to live in Manchester when he was an infant of four or five. By that time, the child could only speak Yoruba. “I knew loads of insults,” he says proudly.\n\nHis favourite phrase in Yoruba was to tell someone, “You’re the son of a goat and is your head all right?”\n\nOver breakfast at the Dean Street Restaurant in Soho, we chat about him playing nurse Angel, working with Winslet, with Judi Dench on The Vote and his analysis of the West End, and joke about what Nigerian traits we both might have. We’d been introduced a few weeks beforehand at a tea party for Winslet hosted by Netflix.\n\nI’m not sure that I want to reveal it exactly, but we laughed over how we both show our displeasure. I will say that it’s all very Nigerian!\n\nFisayo Akinade Baz\n\nFor the longest time I’d been aware of Akinade’s work on stage ever since he appeared as The Boy in a touring production of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. However, I really became aware of him when he appeared in the two dramas that Russell T Davies penned for Channel 4 in 2012, Banana and Cucumber.\n\nHe kept popping up all over the place and then Josie Rourke cast him in James Graham’s immersive 2015 general election drama The Vote at the Donmar Warehouse Theatre, where the theatrical all-star ensemble included Dame Judi, Mark Gatiss, Catherine Tate,Nina Sosanya, Timothy West, Rosalie Craig, Bill Paterson, Paul Chahidi, Jade Anouka, Jude Law, Finty Williams, Heather Craney, Hadley Fraser and Prasanna Puwanarajah.\n\nI guess the point is: who wasn’t in it?!\n\nLike Dame Judi, Akinade enjoys doing crossword puzzles. “She’s the nicest woman alive,” he says, eyes sparkling as he recalls their time working on The Vote.\n\nThe immersive production had a handful of performances leading up to a live broadcast on election night, which I was lucky enough to attend, on More4. It was timed to end on the dot at 10pm local time when polls closed.\n\n“Inbuilt into the play were cues to let you know how far ahead or behind you were,” says Akinade. “There was a point where we were a little bit behind hitting ten o’clock, and someone came on and announced the time, which meant that we were behind. Judi out of nowhere started firing her lines out so quickly, and then everybody on stage started firing their lines too and we caught up in the play, ending bang on ten. We’d never hit that target before. It was amazing,” he marvels.\n\nHowever, Akinade, in an astute analysis of the West End, feels that nowadays theater is “at a weird junction” because, he suggests, “There’s real pressure to make money and keep it robust. AI hurt and the writers and actors strikes in America hurt. You’ve got a lot of actors and and then there’s not enough money, so everyone who was doing prestige TV and film came down. The film stars started doing TV. The TV stars started doing plays, so it squeezed everybody down.”\n\nLook at the West End, for example, he argues: “There is a celebrity in almost every show, and I get it because they need to pull [audiences], but what’s going to happen is people won’t go now unless there’s somebody recognizable in a lead role.\n\n“Before you could put a play like Downstate [Bruce Norris’s controversial drama about child-sex offenders] on at the National Theatre, and people would be like, ‘It’s the greatest piece of fucking acting you will ever see from the greatest ensemble cast from [Steppenwolf] Chicago ever.’ It would sell out, whereas now, you’ve got to put your stars in, otherwise you’re screwed,” he says with concern in his voice.\n\nTo a point, because there are A-listers who are genuine creatures of the stage such as Billy Crudup and Denise Gough in High Noon at the Harold Pinter – and what about Bryan Cranston, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Paapa Essiedu in Ivo van Hove’s unbelievably powerful revival of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons at Wyndham’s Theatre? They’re all legit. “And that’s the nuance,” says Akinade. “He [Crudup] happens to be very famous – and he’s a theater actor.”\n\nL/R Fisayo Akinade and Gemma Arterton in ‘Saint Joan’ Jack Sain\n\nNot long after appearing in The Vote, the Donmar offered Akinade a role in George Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan with Gemma Arterton, but the part in question wasn’t for him. “Very early and quite riskily, I said no thank you to the Donmar,” he explains. The theater soon came back and asked him to play the Dauphin and he took it because he believes it’s the best part in the play. “It was one of the best times,” he recalls. “I just got to be a petulant king and it was so fun.”\n\nTurning down the initial part was “scary” because, “If you’re not working as an actor, you are not earning a thing,” he says. “You may have to do a few shifts in the pub, but now having been 14 years in [the business], the power of ‘no’ is so important. You really have to, for yourself, determine what you are going to do and what you will not do. What you say ‘no’ to is far more important than what you say ‘yes’ to.”\n\nWhat will he not do? “All I want to do is play roles that have interesting arcs – a character is different at the end of the thing than they are at the beginning,” he says. “They’re changed somehow. I don’t care about being the lead or supporting character.”\n\nFor example, the Reverend Hale part,which the actor played in Arthur Miller’s The Crucible directed by Lyndsey Turner at the National Theatre, is for him the greatest arc in that play because the character is “somebody that is so devout and utterly convicted – and then he sees that this divine thing he has spent his life devoted to is corruptible. I just find that shift so potent,” he reasons.\n\nL-R: Erin Doherty and Fisayo Akinade in ‘The Crucible’ Johan Persson\n\nIt’s the same reason he played Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet opposite Josh O’Connor and Jessie Buckley in director Simon Godwin’s production that was bound for the National Theatre until Covid happened and it was filmed for the National and Sky Arts.\n\nNational Theatre at home.\n\nBackground work\n\nAkinade says that Winslet set up hands-on-experience meetings with two palliative care nurses on a cancer ward at a London hospital in preparation for his role. What was important for Akinade is that Muti Akinade, his mom, has been a carer for most of his life – first with the elderly and now with people with adult learning difficulties.\n\nHe felt the role allowed him to pay homage to his mother. “The way my mum cares is very Nigerian, so it is very tough love, monumental love. She had all these amazing techniques for getting in and soothing, so that’s one aspect that I wanted to bring to Angel.”\n\nOne of the nurses Winslet introduced him to was a 30-year veteran who still had the enthusiasm for care, compassion and empathy “despite the hours, despite the pay, despite how they’re sometimes treated, despite all of the things NHS nurses have to endure.”\n\nThe nurse alos provided the actor with one of the film’s best lines. “She said, ‘When a patient comes in for end of life care, my first thought is that we have to get it right. We have to make sure this person gets a good goodbye.’”\n\nL-R: Johnny Flynn as Connor, Andrea Riseborough as Molly, Timothy Spall as Bernie, Kate Winslet as Julia and Fisayo Akinade as Angel in ‘Goodbye June’ Kimberley French/Netflix\n\nAkinade texted Winslet referencing the “good goodbye” adage and her immediate response was, “‘That’s going in the film.’ And then it did.” Sipping his coffee, he adds: “That was just so beautiful because that’s a real life quote from a real NHS nurse, and it was just very important to me to represent the NHS properly.”\n\nAs the film plays out, Angel observes the four siblings, especially the petty quarrels between the sisters played by Winslet and Riseborough. Wisely, he well understands that families bicker but knows the arguments should come later. “When your mum goes, are you going to be thinking about what happens to her ring, or are you just going to be missing your mum,” asks Akinade of his character’s motivations. “You can fight later. None of this is important.”\n\nI realize that I had watched the film through Angel’s eyes. It’s his common sense that helps get the family in shape to see what’s happening to the matriarch. I’m a fervent believer in gaining wisdom from art.\n\nAkinade agrees and says that Steven Spielberg’s film The Color Purple “was one of the most formative” he’s seen because “there’s a woman that is horrendously abused who not only finds her power, but also finds love in that.”\n\nHe watched the film with his mother at a time when he was being bullied at school. “And she knew that,” he recalls. “So she was like, ‘Come and watch this.’ She was essentially saying, ‘Look what happened to this woman. Look. And now look at her at the end. Look how happy she is. Look how free she’s about to be. You’ll be all right.’”\n\nSunday was their day to sit and watch films. It could be The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and The Clash of the Titans. One day when he was maybe 13, he watched Philadelphia, starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. “It was probably too soon, but that was deeply, profoundly moving for me and I don’t think my mum or dad at the time understood why,” says Akinade. “For me, I was like, ‘Oh, look at this man defending this gay man… with such conviction.’”\n\nIt was very surreal moment, he says, when he appeared in Jeremy O. Harris’s Slave Play featuring Olivia Washington when he got to meet her parents, Pauletta Washington and Denzel Washington. “He was just ginormous in his energy, but so warm,” says Akinade. “He turned to me and exclaimed, ’Oh, you. You’re really good.’ He pulled me into a bear hug and then sort of jokingly said, ‘If you keep going, you can be something special.’ That is all I will need for the rest of my days,” he says with a satisfied sigh.\n\nAll of this was happening around the time Denzel’s son, Malcom Washington, was preparing his film, The Piano Lesson, for that year’s awards season. Suddenly, he and I are heaping praise on Danielle Deadwyler with Akinade insisting that “somebody give her the Viola [Davis] treatment” and find her roles that catapult her star. We spend an inordinate about of time discussing the roles both Deadwyler and Davis have played on screen.\n\nL-R Helen Mirren as June and Kate Winslet as Julia in ‘Goodbye June’ Kimberley French/Netflix\n\nAkinade recalls being in a cinema and “literally levitating“ when he watched Davis standing toe-to-toe with Meryl Streep in Doubt.\n\nDuring a conversation last summer, Winslet revealed to me that Akinade’s role as Angel originally wasn’t as big a part as it has now become. “He’s so bloody good, he can do anything,” she said. The part grew through the two of them “just chatting,” is how Akinade puts it.\n\n“I would get a text every now and then saying, ‘We just added this’ or ‘I think we’re going to get you more involved in this bit.’ I thought that’s really lovely because as much as it is a film about a family’s matriarch dying and the family coming back together, I also think it’s a real love letter to carers, nurses and the NHS, and the ways in which those people in that institution take care of the entire [British] nation for free.”\n\nHe becomes visibly moved as he explains that his own father had been treated for cancer. “He beat cancer twice because of care – and he had that care for free.”\n\nAkinade reckons that because Winslet gave him so much more to do in the film, “That through line became more potent – and therefore more personal for me – because it’s just a lovely little side story.”\n\nAvoiding tokenism\n\nI love that Angel is not a black character that can be deemed token. Akinade laughs then observes sharply that this can’t be the case when it comes to the NHS, “Because you go to any hospital and who’s looking after you?” He adds: “Yes, it would have been tokenism if it wasn’t true.”\n\nHis mother was very touched by Angel when she attended the London premiere. What the character does for the family in Goodbye June is such an act of empathy and generosity, the kind that’s not often publicly highlighted. Akinade’s a big brother to two sisters. His parents live in Manchester, as does his younger sibling, while his middle sister resides in London. He loves going home to visit where “it’s the place I’m my most comfortable self anywhere.”\n\nThere was never any pressure from his parents about him becoming an actor. They knew that the life is not always the easiest, but he’s grateful that they never suggested he become a doctor. Once they saw he was getting theater work regularly and then cast in Banana and Cucumber they knew he would be alright.\n\nHis widest variety of roles have been on stage. “There’s a bit more imagination there,” he says. However, he has had the best time working on screen in all manner of shows, including Heartstopper. In the Netflix series he plays Mr. Ajayi, and lauds the series for doing “so much for young LGBTQ people.”\n\nSome people watching it, he says, “Wish they’d had this level of freedom, openness and care when I was at school because it does feel, in some cases, easier to be open and out about your sexuality or gender identity or whatever it may be now, than it was then, which is amazing.”\n\nFisayo Akinade in ‘Heartstopper’ Netflix\n\nWorking on other shows has been helpful for him, he says. “I’ve been gay a very long time, but when Cucumber was coming out I was like, ‘How do I navigate this?’ I called Russell T. Davis and he met me in Pret in Euston Station, and said, ‘There’s one question and one answer. Are you gay? Yes you are.’ He said, ‘If you don’t [embrace] that, you will spend your life terrified of being caught out and found out…You will be a half version of yourself. So are you? Yes. And on you move.’\n\n“Then you are unburdened… from the fear of being caught out. It was a scary thing [but] it actually hasn’t held me back.”\n\nQuite right too. Why should it matter? There are too many meaningless distinctions, he argues, but there are some useful ones too, he suggests. For instance, “You want to buy a sofa. When you talk to the assistant, you say, ‘I would like a soft sofa or a big sofa or an L-shaped sofa. They’re useful distinctions for what you want.\n\n“But when you say to a person, ‘Daniel Day Lewis, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, they are actors. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Forest Whittaker, Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, they’re black actors. Why? What’s the difference? The job is exactly the same. So why put in the word black or gay or northern or working class before the job of actor, what does it do? What function does that distinction have? Serves no purpose or other than to other.”\n\nContinuing, he says: “There are people that act and there are black people that act. I think that sets off prejudices in people’s heads.”\n\nBut sometimes the casting of an actor who is black can transform a role. We both jump on Cynthia Erivo in Wicked as an example. “Having a black woman play that role makes Elphaba’s difference more potent,” he says. “As soon as you include a person of color in something, it is going to be whether consciously or unconsciously, an aspect of that is going to become racialized – of course it is. Now you have Elphaba who’s green, played by a black woman. There is another layer, another nuance, that is challenging audiences to invest on a deeper level.”\n\nUpcoming he has a television drama which for now he’s not able to discuss. In any event, he says he’s lucky to have worked with great stars such as Mirren and Dench. Initially, he admits he was “scared’” of meeting the former “because she’s Helen Mirren,” but he didn’t need to worry. “She was just the loveliest, so not starry and down to earth.”\n\nThe same was true for Dame Judi. When they did a run-through of The Vote at a church hall in Islington, he arrived early, and Dench and Finty Williams, her daughter, pitched up shortly afterwards. “She went, ’Hello, I’m Judi’… And she went, ‘Feel my palm. Feel it… that’s cold sweat. I’m fucking terrified. Don’t judge me on what I do today.’ I said, ‘But you’re fucking Judi Dench!’ She said, ‘I fucking know who I am. Don’t judge me.’ And I was like, ‘Well, I won’t. Of course not.’”\n\nFisayo Akinade is already a great actor and a deeply caring dude. That’s why he steals Goodbye June with one tiny line.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:18:31 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:24:24.795144"}

Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo is back after a 12-year absence to the West End, as Deadline was first to report, to play all 23 roles in a bloodthirsty version of Dracula. Josh O’Connor, a lead in next year’s Steven Spielberg blockbuster Disclosure Day, will trace the downfall of a classical violinist who opts instead for a bruising life as a boxer in a rare revival of Clifford Odets’ Golden Boy.\n\nSo why do they do it? They’re both screen idols in demand and their agents have endless goodies lined up for them, yet they’d rather face the harsh glare of a follow spot.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nErivo & O’Connor\n\nJosh O’Connor Theo Wargo/Getty Images\n\nBoth Erivo and O’Connor are legitimate creatures of the stage and both tell me they miss it. They also say that it terrifies them. “It’s like running towards the fire,” Erivo says. “I’m doing Dracula because it scares the sh*t out of me,” they add.\n\nO’Connor says he wants to re-experience the danger of performing in front of a live audience where there’s “no safety net.”\n\nDuring a chat with him as he wraps on Spielberg’s picture, he chose the word that sums it all up: “It’s the fear. Actors love it.”\n\nErivo is now in London sinking her teeth into rehearsals with director Kip Williams for the 112 performances they will give at the Noel Coward Theatre over a 15-week season beginning February 4. Should they need to take a flight to attend awards shows across the pond, some dates have been blocked off.\n\nCynthia Erivo at the “Wicked: For Good” New York premiere Getty Images\n\nThe Tony winner and Oscar nominee was last on stage in the West End when they appeared with Harriet Walter in Phyllida Lloyd’s production of Henry IV, set in a prison, at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014. From there, Erivo headed to Broadway to play Celie in The Color Purple. They tell us that they’re using their own talon-like fingernails to play Bram Stoker’s vampire.\n\nTheir astonishing performance as Elphaba in Jon M. Chu’s two Wicked moves proves they have the stamina to command the stage of the Noel Coward, performing multiple roles. Erivo says they were convinced they could do it after seeing Sarah Snook play 26 different characters in The Picture of Dorian Gray on Broadway.\n\nBoth Dracula and Dorian Gray originated out of the Sydney Theatre Company and were directed by Williams. Producers Michael Cassel and Adam Kenwright are responsible for bringing them to London. Snook took The Picture of Dorian Gray to Broadway, and although no one’s saying so out loud, Dracula is likely going to rest in their sarcophagus and be transported to New York as well.\n\nSam Yates, who directed Andrew Scott in Vanya at the Old Vic and in New York, will begin rehearsals with O’Connor and the Golden Boy company as soon as The Crown, Challengers and God’s Own Country star completes red carpet duties for Disclosure Day, which opens June 12.\n\nO’Connor, currently seen in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, The Mastermind and The History of Sound, also needs to get into prizefighting shape for Golden Boy, which runs at the Almeida from September 8-October 31.\n\nSwinton & Oldman\n\nTilda Swinton Courtesy Royal Court\n\nElsewhere, Oscar-winning actors Tilda Swinton and Gary Oldman are both returning to their theatrical roots at the same address, the Royal Court in Sloane Square, to help celebrate its 70th anniversary.\n\nThe last time Swinton trod the boards was in Manfred Karger’s Man to Man for the play’s 1988 London premiere. It had transferred down from Edinburgh’s Traverse Theatre where it originated in 1987 with Swinton taking up the solo role of Ella Gericke, a German widow who, beginning in the 1930s, assumes the identity and work of Max, her deceased husband, to help her through years of tumultuous upheaval in her country. I saw her do it at the Royal Court and she was pretty remarkable; thrilling that Swinton has signed up to take the part on again with Man to Man‘s original creative team led by director Stephen Unwin.\n\nI’m curious to see if Swinton’s reemergence on stage encourages her to perform more in the theater. Don’t want to boast, but I’m going to anyway — I saw her perform a variety of roles opposite the likes of Judi Dench and Peggy Mount in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s legendary 1982-85 seasons at Stratford-upon-Avon and the Barbican, in Mother Courage and Her Children (with Dench and Zoë Wanamaker) and Measure for Measure (with Mount, Daniel Massey and Juliet Stevenson playing Isabella). Swinton had small and large roles in other plays that performed in the repertory.\n\nThe very last time Swinton took a bow was in Unwin’s production of Peter Handke’s The Long Way Round at the National Theatre 35 years ago. Having seen it, I can understand why she stayed away so long!\n\nMan to Man plays the Royal Court’s Jerwood Theatre Downstairs begins September 5. It will transfer to New York in spring 2027.\n\nGary Oldman Dan Doperalski/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty Images\n\nSlow Horses star Oldman precedes Swinton into the Jerwood Downstairs with Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape, which originated at the Royal Court in 1958. Oldman recently revived the one-man drama, in which he both starred in and directed, at York Theatre Royal last April and May.\n\nOldman performed in a series of plays at the Royal Court over a two-year period beginning in 1985, culminating in a breathtaking performance opposite Lesley Manville in Serious Money, Caryl Churchill’s ferocious takedown of high finance.\n\nKrapp’s Last Tape runs from May 8.\n\nChris Pine\n\nChris Pine and ‘Ivanov’ The Bridge Theatre\n\nChris Pine (Star Trek, Into the Woods) makes his London stage debut as Anton Chekhov’s angst-ridden Nikolai Ivanov in a new adaptation of Ivanov by Simon Stone running at the Bridge Theatre from July 4-September 19.\n\nSome folk I know rolled their eyes when they heard about Pine’s casting to play a man undone by his own malaise. But Pine’s a classically trained thespian who studied at UC Berkeley and Leeds University before undertaking further acting courses at ACT in San Francisco. I feel we shouldn’t disdain American screen actors who come here to tread our boards with serious intent. Although it’s true that some, more homegrown than Americans, do venture from screen to stage and it’s clear they haven’t the chops for it, still they rake in the money at the box office in any old slop, and audiences leave disappointed because the star from the telly was a dud. Tis’ not the season to name names.\n\nIvanov’s tricky to pull off so kudos to Pine for running towards the fire. By the way, my benchmark for Ivanov, gawd knows I’ve seen a few, is Ralph Fiennes who was luminous in a crackerjack production that Jonathan Kent directed at the Almeida in 1997 from a version by David Hare.\n\nIvanov plays the Bridge Theatre from July 4-September 19.\n\nRosamund Pike in ‘Inter Alia’ Mads Perch\n\nTom Stoppard had already approved the casting for the Old Vic’s revival of his 1993 masterpiece Arcadia before he died late last month. Carrie Cracknell’s now in rehearsals with a company that includes Isis Hainsworth, Seamus Dillane, Prasanna Puwanarajah, Leila Fazad, Fiona Button, Holly Godliman, Angus Cooper, Gabriel Akuwudike and William Lawlor. The story is that of a child prodigy and theories of literary scandal and scientific intrigue that moves between two eras.\n\nFelicity Kendal, Bill Nighy, Harriet Walter, Samuel West and Emma Fielding were in the original company at the National that Trevor Nunn directed. What an opening night that was!\n\nKendal, a Stoppard muse, can be seen currently in the playwright’s 1995 play Indian Ink directed by Jonathan Kent at Hampstead Theatre until January 31.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl, The Wheel of Time) reprises her star turn in the transfer of Suzie Miller’s searing legal drama Inter Alia from the National, where it was a sold-out hit, to Wyndham’s Theatre from March 19-June 20.\n\nPike is joined by Jamie Glover, who played her husband in the NT production directed by Justin Martin. It’s about a karaoke-loving Old Bailey judge who finds herself at the center of an ethical conundrum involving her college-age son.\n\nMiller’s other legal scorcher, Prima Facie, is going on tour. The one-woman drama, a soaraway success in London and on Broadway, saw Jodie Comer win Tony, Olivier, Evening Standard and all the silverware going for her portrait of an attorney who represents alleged sexual offenders and is herself raped. Play opens at Richmond Theatre, south west of London, on January 23 and then plays eight other dates from Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre to the Playhouse in Liverpool, wrapping there March 21.\n\nClint Dyer (Get Up, Stand Up!, Death of England Plays), the former National Theatre deputy artistic director and now an NT Artistic Associate, directs Aaron Pierre (The Morning Show, Lanterns, Rebel Ridge, The Underground Railroad) playing Randle P. McMurphy in the stage production of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest adapted by Dale Wasserman.\n\nAaron Pierre Peyton Fulford\n\nOlivier Award-winner Giles Terera (Hamilton, Rosmersholm, Othello), a frequent collaborator of Dyer’s, plays Dale Harding, the savviest patient in the psychiatric facility who initially locks horns with McMurphy. The play runs at the Old Vic from April 1-May 23. William Redfield (A New Leaf, Death Wish) played Harding in Milos Forman’s classic 1975 movie, and we all know Jack Nicholson took on McMurphy.\n\nI’m hearing of some cool casting ideas in the works for Nurse Ratched, who was played by Louise Fletcher in the film.\n\nDyer also directs Letitia Wright (Black Panther, Small Axe) in the UK premiere of Tracey Scott Wilson’s incendiary drama The Story, about a reporter who clashes with their editor (what’s new!) over a hot-button issue. Throw in some racism and journalistic ethics into the mix.\n\nLetitia Wright Jeff Spicer/Getty for Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nMarianne Elliott directs a major-league revival of Christopher Hampton’s Les Liasons Dangereuses from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ epistolary novel starring Lesley Manville, Monica Barbaro and Aidan Turner at the National from March 21-June 6.\n\nAlso National Theatre bound is the musical adaptation of the 2014 movie Pride written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus. They reunite for this new show, which has been developed by Warchus with Beresford writing the book and lyrics, with music by Christopher Nightingale, Josh Cohen and DJ Walde.\n\nLesley Manville and Aidan Turner in artwork for ‘Les Liasons Dangereuses’ National Theatre\n\nPride is inspired by the true tale of how a group known as “Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners” came to the aid of a Welsh pit village during the 1984 miner’s strike. The movie starred Ben Schnetzer, Andrew Scott, Imelda Staunton, Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, George MacKay, Dominic West, Monica Dolan and Liz White.\n\nThe musical plays the National’s Dorfman Theatre from June 11-September 12.\n\nHowever, the keenest amongst you should scoot off to Cardiff’s Sherman Theatre for Pride’s outta town world premiere from March 31 through April 18.\n\nHappy Valley’s Siobhan Finneran stars in J.B. Priestley’s great farce When We Are Married, which is on now at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Tim Sheader, until February 7. Finnegan’s joined by Samantha Spiro, Sophie Thompson, Tori Allen-Martin, Leo Wringer and Ron Cook.\n\n(L-R) Sophie Thompson, Siobhan Finneran and Samantha Spiro in ‘When We Are Married’ Johan Persson\n\nThe best ever production of When We Are Married starred Patricia Routledge, Timothy West, Prunella Scales, Brian Murphy, Bill Fraser, Patsy Rowlands and Patricia Hayes at the old Whitehall Theatre (now the Trafalgar) in 1985. Watching them was pure comedy gold.\n\nFollowing Finneran and company into the Donmar from February 14 is Anastasia Hille (The Bletchley Circle, A Gentleman in Moscow) and Erin Kellyman (28 Years Later, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) in the world premiere of Evening All Afternoon by Anna Ziegler (Photograph 51), about how a stepmother and her stepdaughter summon quiet courage “to open their hearts again.”\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor has been spotted at rehearsals in Clapham, South London for the Royal Shakespeare Company’s musical adaptation of The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, based on Ejiofor’s 2019 Netflix movie about how schoolboy William Kamkwamba, then aged 13, saved his village in Malawi from famine by devising a windmill from scratch to provide electricity to pump water and irrigate crops.\n\nEjiofor has been appointed the show’s creative associate and is on hand should director Lynette Linton, the cast and creatives require any guidance related to the story. Kenny Wax, who holds the West End rights, tells me that the cast, with Alistair Nwachukwu as William, have been “raising the roof” over at the RSC’s London rehearsal hall. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind opens at the RSC’s Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon on February 10 and runs through March 28. The show features book and lyrics by Richy Hughes and music and lyrics by Tim Sutton.\n\nIt then transfers to @sohoplace in the West End from April 25-July 18.\n\nAlistair Nwachukwu Dujonna\n\nNwachukwu was a member of the ensemble that performed in the excellent play The Line of Beauty, based on Alan Hollinghurst’s bestselling novel. It was directed by Michael Grandage and adapted by Jack Holden, who described it as a drama “about class and furniture.” Anyhow, there’s no word yet on when, where and casting, but it’s likely to transfer into the West End. Jasper Talbot, Leo Surer, Ellie Bamber, Arty Froushan, Charles Edwards, Claudia Harrison, Robert Portal and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers were at the top of their game when I caught the final Almeida performance.\n\nThe aforementioned Froushan will headline, as we reported here recently, a revised revival of the musical version of Bret Easton Ellis’ notorious novel American Psycho directed again by Rupert Goold. Show features a book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik. It runs at the Almeida from January 22-March 14.\n\nMore from the RSC: Kenneth Branagh returns to Stratford’s Royal Shakespeare Theatre to play Prospero in The Tempest, directed by Richard Eyre, with performances from May 13 through June 20.\n\nBranagh also appears with Academy Award-winning Helen Hunt making her RSC debut as Ranyevskaya in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard directed by Tamara Harvey from a new version by Laura Wade. A limited season at The Swan Theatre runs July 10-August 29.\n\nHelen Hunt\n\nMark Gatiss also debuts at the RSC in Bertolt Brecht’s The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, in a version by Stephen Sharkey that’s directed by Seán Linnen, also at The Swan, from April 11 through May 30.\n\nHigh Noon, adapted from the classic Western by Eric Roth, is in previews at the Harold Pinter Theatre with Billy Crudup and Denise Gough playing, and expanding, the roles played by Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly in Fred Zinnemann’s movie written by Carl Forman. Roth tells me it’s about “courage.”\n\nArthur Miller’s All My Sons is unmissable at Wyndham’s Theatre starring Bryan Cranston, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Glynn-Carney and Hayley Squires. The magnificent production directed by Ivo van Hove opened to rave notices a few weeks back, but it runs until March 7.\n\nAnd we delivered you the scoop on Sadie Sink (Stranger Things) and Noah Jupe (Hamnet) making their West End debuts in Romeo & Juliet directed by Robert Icke, which runs at the Harold Pinter Theatre beginning March 16 for a limited season until June 6. The full company rehearse late January.\n\nSadie Sink and Noah Jupe Helen Murray\n\nA tip: Theo Jamieson, musical director at the Royal Shakespeare Company, has written the book, music and lyrics for a new musical developed at the National Theatre Studio called Flyby. There’s talk of it heading to Southwark Theatre at some point next year starring Poppy Gilbert (Sherwood, Chloe). From what I’m hearing, Gilbert is a revelation.\n\nYou heard it here first.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:24:25.062328"}

Trump urged CBS to pull the plug on Colbert’s show “NOW” instead of ending its run next May.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Stephen Colbert is a pathetic trainwreck, with no talent or anything else necessary for show business success,” Trump wrote in a post at 12:16 a.m. ET on his Truth Social platform. “Now, after being terminated by CBS, but left out to dry, he has actually gotten worse, along with his nonexistent ratings. Stephen is running on hatred and fumes ~ A dead man walking! CBS should, ‘put him to sleep,’ NOW, it is the humanitarian thing to do!”\n\nSeven minutes later, Trump followed up with this: “Who has the worst Late Night host, CBS, ABC, or NBC??? They all have three things in common: High Salaries, No Talent, REALLY LOW RATINGS!”\n\nTrump also reiterated his call for the U.S. government to revoke TV broadcasters’ licenses. “If Network NEWSCASTS, and their Late Night Shows, are almost 100% Negative to President Donald J. Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party, shouldn’t their very valuable Broadcast Licenses be terminated? I say, YES!” Then, three minutes after that post, the president shared, “MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!”\n\nThe episode of “The Late Show” that CBS aired on Dec. 23 was a rerun, featuring guests Sigourney Weaver and Mandy Patinkin. It originally aired on Dec. 8 — and that night, Colbert took several shots at Trump, including his takeover of the Kennedy Center and his move to seize hosting duties at the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n“This year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony is the very first since Trump installed himself as chair of the Kennedy Center’s board,” Colbert said in his monologue, eliciting boos from the audience. In response, Colbert said, “Yeah, I kind of agree. It seems like the commander-in-chief shouldn’t have enough time to run a theater. ‘Mr. President, Mr. President, Russia has just launched another round of missiles. But first, dress rehearsal for ‘Oklahoma’ is underway, and the blocking is uninspired,'” Colbert joked.\n\nAt another point, Colbert admitted, “I don’t know how much effort I’m putting into the impression [of Trump] anymore. And I don’t care… Fire me!”\n\nColbert also played some of Trump’s remarks in which “he pre-complained about how people will judge his hosting” of the Kennedy Center Honors, according to Colbert. Trump had claimed that as the ceremony’s host, “Jimmy Kimmel was horrible…. If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be president.” To which Colbert quipped: “You can’t and you shouldn’t.”\n\nThen Colbert fact-checked Trump. “Just a quick brain check for Grandpa Puddin’ Skull: I called [Kimmel] and Jimmy Kimmel has never hosted the Kennedy Center Honors,” eliciting a huge laugh from the audience. “But here’s the thing: I did, the three years leading up to Trump becoming president.”\n\nIn the monologue, Colbert also made fun of Trump for receiving the “fake” inaugural FIFA Peace Prize award “after years of campaigning unsuccessfully for the Nobel Peace Prize.”\n\n“Later that same day, Trump also received the Hooters National Book Award,” Colbert joshed. “It was the breast of times, it was the worst of boobs.” The CBS host said Trump’s FIFA Peace Prize is “like for Christmas if you ask your mom for a Super Nintendo and she gets you something called ‘Super Retendo.’ It comes with ‘Super Marion Brothers’ and ‘Legend of Kelvin.'” Colbert said FIFA president Gianni Infantino “pulled on all the stops for Trump’s Big Boy Trophy Party,” adding that in a photo showing Trump picking up the medal Infantino awarded to him, the president “looks like a goblin asking if it’s OK to eat a third baby.”\n\nAfter CBS announced this summer that “The Late Show” would be ending in May 2026, Trump gloated that “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.” A few days later on the show, Colbert fired back, telling the president, “Go fuck yourself” (with the f-word censored).\n\nCBS, in announcing the cancellation of “The Late Show,” insisted the move was “purely a financial decision” that came after a years-long decline in the economics of late-night TV.\n\nIn its Dec. 23 broadcast of the Kennedy Center Honors, CBS did not refer to the place as the “Trump Kennedy Center,” largely because the ceremony was recorded before Trump’s name was screwed on to the building last week. CBS News’ standards department instructed staffers last week to maintain the original Kennedy Center name in their coverage, the Washington Post reported. “If the president or other administration officials use the new name in a soundbite that is their prerogative,” the news org said.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:48:17 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T11:55:18.276428"}

However, unlike her fictional stand-in, the grouchy romantasy author Carol Sturka, she did so without fear.\n\nGilligan has been forthright during the press rounds for the popular Apple TV show, now the streamer’s most-watched in history, that he penned the sprawling series with Better Call Saul’s shrewd Kim Wexler in mind. For Seehorn, it was equally a no-brainer.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“I think especially as women, we sometimes want to know exactly where you’re going to take the character, because what if we’re not going to really be used? What if the character won’t be allowed to evolve in any way? I already know he’s not going to do that,” she tells Deadline of the role.\n\nCarol is abrasive, challenging and deeply relatable. Despite being “extremely impulsive and extremely reactive,” her decisions are propelled by a deep sense of loss, righteous anger and, as Seehorn describes it, “passionate rage.” What drew the three-time Emmy nominee to the part even further wasn’t just the character’s “challenging” complexity, but also the content of the show, which makes legible philosophical queries that have plagued our species since inception.\n\nBelow, Seehorn chats about Carol’s intractable grief, the joys of creativity and why her character’s Season 1 finale decision is a “completely normal response to a breakup.”\n\nDEADLINE: First off, congratulations on the Golden Globe nomination — so well deserved. Creator Vince Gilligan has said he wrote this part for you, but aside from working with him again, what drew you to this character?\n\nRHEA SEEHORN: It literally just was Vince. Even if he didn’t write it for me, Vince just saying, ‘I have a project for you’ — because of his style of collaboration, the sets he creates, the department heads he surrounds himself with, the civility he conducts his sets with and then the writing itself is just the best foundation you’ll ever have to try to build a character. And I didn’t have any fear about it. He didn’t even tell me what it was going to be about. I had no idea. And I said, ‘It’s fine, just yes.’ And he said, ‘Well, no, you can wait and read it first.’ I said, ‘I don’t need to.’\n\nI think especially as women, we sometimes want to know exactly where you’re going to take the character, because what if we’re not going to really be used? What if the character won’t be allowed to evolve in any way? I already know he’s not going to do that. Then, once I got the script, I would imagine I had a similar reaction to many people who watched the pilot, which is, ‘This is bananas. What is happening, and where are we going from here?’ His scripts … have pace and tone in them, so you have that breathless journey as you do when you’re watching them; they’re really fun reads.\n\nAnd I also could see all these genres that he was playing with and then turning them on their ear. I could also see these tone shifts that then got even wilder in swings once we’re working on performing them. I was like, ‘Was that comedy that just happened in the middle of that horribly dark moment?’ I was like, ‘Wow, this is going to be challenging, and so much fun.’ And I just got really excited. And my first thought was, ‘Oh, this would be a show for me as a watcher.’ I’d be so excited about this show, plot-wise and character-wise, but then also the profound questions it brings up about what it means to be human.\n\nRhea Seehorn as Carol Sturka in ‘Pluribus’ (Apple TV)\n\nAs a creative person, probably the most horrifying idea is that you can’t create something new in this world. In the show, you have to balance the overwhelming loss that is catapulting all of Carol’s decisions, and the tightrope she walks between wanting answers, wanting to fix things, and inadvertently contributing to suffering in a world that is now devoid of it. Were those discussions something that you were exploring as you stepped into this world?\n\nVince wasn’t writing to a particular theme or a topic. Many people have felt like: Is this commentary on AI? Is this commentary on the pandemic lockdown, divisiveness in our country, zealotry of any kind, community versus the individual? And he wasn’t writing to any of those themes; he was writing about human nature, but he does live in the world we’re living in.\n\nI, too, believe that when I’m playing the part, Carol is not viewing this as a theoretical debate topic. She does not have the luxury of thinking about this philosophically. It’s only when it comes up practically as far as wrestling with the debate of, ‘Am I allowed to believe that these people really care about me? Do I really think these people are a threat? What kind of threat are they?’ So I wasn’t really looking at it in an ideological way either, but I certainly had some really fun late-night conversations with my crew on weekends, of just the questions it brings up. Not only what would you do, but how do you redefine the idea of love? Is true love only when it’s unique to you? And is there something wrong with me that I might appraise some art as high art and some art as low art, or real writing versus not real? What is that? As long as it makes one person happy, isn’t it all the same? Is there something wrong with me that I actually love to be competitive with myself, and that I always want to get better at every scene I do? I hope I become a better and better actor, but would I be OK if everybody was brilliant? I don’t know.\n\nAnd to your point, one of the biggest things for me, is the joy of being surprised by what others have created, whether it’s a book or a song or a play or someone else’s performance or art, a joke — to ever have a real belly gut laugh at something, again, necessitates surprise. But I suppose the others would argue: But they are in awe of everything; everything is beautiful.\n\nI don’t think it’s for me, though.\n\nManousos is both a parallel and a foil of sorts to Carol. They are driven by similar things, are stubborn and angry — very relatably so. But the way Carlos-Manuel Vesga put it was that Carol has everything but no purpose, and he has purpose but has nothing. I’m curious how you view that, or if you view it similarly.\n\nWas he speaking about Carol before [the Joining]?\n\nNo, after.\n\nI deeply disagree then.\n\nHow great is Carlos-Manuel though? We’re all a bunch of complete nerds that sit around talking about deep-dive script analysis of characters. It would bore anybody else to tears but Carlos-Manuel has definitive opinions about what the other characters are or think or are doing that sometimes we do not, and we have a very good time and a good laugh about debating him sometimes. He has not told me that one.\n\nCarol absolutely has purpose. He may have gone through the Darién Gap because of his purpose, but Carol, thinking that she needs to save the world, lifted a 500-pound gorilla called grief off her chest every single morning, and every glance out that window by the back kitchen sink, and every paver she put down, and no matter how exhausted she was [while] digging the grave for [her] own wife, gets back up; gets back up when she sees a barcode on the bag.\n\nCarlos-Manuel Vesga as Manousos Oviedo in ‘Pluribus’ (Apple TV)\n\nShe is addicted to having a purpose, in my opinion. Sure, it’s a distraction from the overwhelming feeling of being bereft and having lost everything but even her stuff with Zosia, when she capitulates to this relationship — someone had asked me earlier: Is the act of beginning to write another novel another distraction of playing house? I said, ‘No, to me, that’s the whole other love of her life, was her career and being a writer,’ and to have it completely taken away from you — there’s no one to write for anymore. When these people come and say, ‘Actually, no, you’re the only person in the whole world that could write a new book for us, and we are eagerly awaiting.’ And her little ego of, ‘I could have fans again,’ and the part of her that’s like, ‘There’s a reason for me to get out of bed and put pants on tomorrow?’ Even amidst this new love affair, she’s up and out of that bed. I know that feeling of having the 4:30 a.m. call, and no matter how early it is, you’re so happy to have the call.\n\nShe’s lacking [in] ways to get to her purpose, and is very, very impulsive and is very, very reactive, but yeah, he’s without purpose, that guy! Come on, you’re just gonna obliterate everybody? How’s that gonna save mankind?\n\nThey do both take the paths of most resistance — digging the grave, refusing to take a plane — so that does show persistence in going after something.\n\nThey’ve definitely met each other’s match in the department of being a stubborn ass.\n\nYou said Carol’s impulsive, which she totally is, but I also find that she is somewhat deliberate in that impulsivity. I read in an interview that you’re constantly thinking about why she’s doing what she’s doing, like, ‘Why is she choosing to sleep on the couch when she can sleep on the bed?’ There’s just so much going on in her brain, and she’s at war with herself. How do you view that, and how do you bring that to your performance?\n\nThe script analysis work I’m doing as an actor is where the ‘why’ comes in, so I’ve thought about: ‘Why did she fall asleep on the couch and fall asleep drinking?’ But Carol, in the moment, did it instinctively; it’s like hot coals to go up that staircase that early — ‘I couldn’t possibly look at her side of the bed.’ So when I’m playing her, and she’s very deliberate at times, I find her extremely impulsive and extremely reactive with a lot of passionate rage. And all of these things at times can be her superpower, but at times the biggest thing in our way is this behavior.\n\nSo even though I, as the actor, may try to think about what’s the ‘why’ that she did it, if I’m trying to play somebody who keeps acting impulsively and reactively, you then take out that transition. So even in our lives, when we have an impulsive reaction to something, if you were to go back and go like, ‘Why did I bark at that family member way too loudly when they commented on my dress?’ And then you go home and you realize, like, ‘Because there was someone else at the table that [is] always remarking on my clothes, and I picked this dress up specifically, and I had already gotten insulted that morning.’ And there was a ‘why,’ but you didn’t think about it at that moment; you just screamed at your cousin.\n\n(L-R): Rhea Seehorn and Karolina Wydra in the Season 1 finale of ‘Pluribus’ Apple TV\n\nOne of the things I wanted to wrap up with was, Carol almost goes on this circular journey from pilot to finale, where she comes back to her purpose, as we discussed. And there’s the atom bomb that she requests, which I loved so much.\n\n[Laughs] Completely normal response to a breakup, don’t you think?\n\nYeah, I wish I could do that. But if you could expand on or describe what’s going on in her head at that moment. Is it a bargaining chip? Is it a threat? Is it a sign of despair? Is it all of these things or none of these things?\n\nI’m not trying to be evasive, I actually think you nailed it. It is all of these things and none of these things. I went and asked Vince, like, ‘Do you know exactly what her plan is with it?’ And he said, ‘No.’ And I think he was being honest; I know they’re in the writers’ room now writing Season 2.\n\nNormally, I do supply my own reason, just so that my acting will have specificity to it. This was one of the rare cases where I thought: It is an impulsive, highly reactionary, highly angry, highly hurt decision. ‘I’m going to ask for the largest, most destructive, horrible thing I could, and I’ll figure out the rest later.’ I think it’s even more rash that she doesn’t have a plan. That’s my opinion.\n\nI think it’s just [that] she wanted to make a huge statement. And she’s so hurt and so angry and doesn’t know what to do and is so overwhelmed by the choices she’s been left [with]. I mean, for one, she’s got to go pair up with Machete Dude? I mean, seriously, that’s my only teammate now? Maybe Diabaté [played by Samba Schutte], if he stops having sex with them; at least I know he doesn’t want to be changed. She’s not super happy about the picks for her team for kickball, I could say that, so she gets an atom bomb! I kind of had fun with the delivery of that last line, too. Just kind of like: ‘I don’t need to explain to you why I got it; it’s an atom bomb, whatever.’\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for concision and clarity.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 17:05:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T17:26:20.196941"}

As episode co-writer and executive producer Alison Tatlock tells Deadline, it was inevitable that the duo’s first meeting “would have to start as a disaster.”\n\n“Because the timing is terrible,” she explains. “If it had happened a couple episodes earlier, maybe we’d have a different story, but by the time he gets there, she’s in a completely different headspace. We, in the script even, had a moment where we, in a stage direction, referred to her kind of vaguely remembering that she made videos where she was calling everyone into action; it’s not where her head is at anymore. And that’s when he shows up, expecting the Carol Sturka that he saw on the video, and that person is a little bit dormant right now.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFellow co-writer, EP and director of the episode, Gordon Smith, adds, “All those things that give grist to the mill were really fun to sort of tease out, and fun to see them not quite be the people that they even think of themselves. Carol thinks, ‘No, I am a hero. Oh, wait, this guy just walked 8,000 miles [sic] to be here. Maybe I haven’t done as much as I thought,’ and vice versa, I think.”\n\nVesga, a prolific Colombian actor who was cast in the role after being up against 710 people, points out the differing stakes between his character and Carol.\n\n“At least when it all starts, they see the enemy in the Joining. I am not sure if their reasons and their motivations are the same,” he says. “I think they come from very different worlds. You have Carol, who is a first-class citizen of the world, and you have Manousos, who’s probably a fifth-class citizen of the world, who is a migrant from Colombia to Paraguay, with all that comes with migrating and leaving your life behind and experiencing the trauma of just landing somewhere else new, losing your world. And then the small, little world that he’s managed to build in Paraguay is taken away from him, so his motivation is like, ‘Hell no, not this time, not again.’”\n\nFor Vesga, that means the two of them are approaching the problem of the Others in dichotomous ways.\n\n“Here’s a guy who has nothing in the world: no food, almost no clothes and yet he has purpose. And we cut from that guy and we go to Carol, who has, quote unquote, everything that she wants and has no purpose,” he says. “Rhea’s an amazing actor, but that one [scene], when she’s sitting in front of that firework, and she knows that it might kill her, and yet she stays there — that is one of the best performances I’ve ever seen. And I was thinking, ‘There is someone who has everything and is without a purpose.’ They seem to be trying to [get] to the same place, but they are going [about it] in a different way for different reasons.” (Editor’s note: Seehorn vehemently disagrees with this characterization, which you can read about here.)\n\nSeehorn and Vesga in the Season 1 finale of ‘Pluribus’ ( Apple TV\n\nAs Manousos and Carol struggle to communicate — because of their mutual unwillingness to cede ground, similar caustic personalities (and certainly a language barrier doesn’t help, though it does add to the scene earned levity) — the former crystallizes his concern: “Do you want to save the world, or save your girl?” The apt distillation of their conundrum (the episode is named “La Chica o El Mundo”) is drawn into focus after Carol fires off a warning shot at Manousos as he triggers a seizure in the Others, not unlike she did some episodes ago. After conducting quasi-scientific experiments on representatives of the Hive, he reaches the conclusion that the Joining can be reversed; but as the Others pack up to leave Manousos, Carol goes with them.\n\nAs Smith characterizes it, the ensuing idyllic montage is Carol’s last-ditch effort to “give in” to the collective.\n\n“That’s really the essence of what we wanted to make it feel like, and that journey was the most beautiful, placid [thing],” he says. “Carol’s giving herself this one chance to give in to the real temptation of the Others, which is, ‘Hey, the world’s beautiful. Come see it with us.’ Essentially, ‘Give in,’ and it needed, I think, for the fall at the end, to hit as hard as it can. Everything else needed to feel like it was just the best vacation, or best series of vacations, that you could possibly hope to take. So we tried to craft that — all of the sequence I feel like I was trying to make the transitions feel like they were gentle, and make the shooting feel like it was gentle.”\n\nCarol and Zosia stroll along sun-soaked beaches, take a bath in a luxurious Shanghai high-rise hotel and unwind with an après-ski evening in (all shot in Big Sky, Montana; as creator Vince Gilligan jokes, “They’re dressed for the beach, but they’re wearing galoshes to get through like a foot of snow and slush right outside the door.”) Just when this domestic serenity reaches its tipping point, Carol stumbles upon an alarming truth: The Others have located the eggs she had frozen with Helen years ago and are actively working on transforming them into stem cells, a process that can take as little as a month.\n\nTatlock says of the Others’ ethical justifications in the matter: “We talked about it a lot, like, ‘What do they do? What will they not do? What line will they cross? What line would they not cross?’ And we agreed that, while they would not force Carol physically to have a procedure that would extract her stem cells, if she had already voluntarily given up her eggs in a previous chapter of her life, which she did, that that would fall under the banner of, not consent, but that would be accessible to them, and that it would not break any ethical rule in their minds. Of course, to her, it feels like a hideous violation. So that’s where they part ways.”\n\nSmith recalls there were “various pitches on the table” as the creative team discussed how the Others would inevitably acquire Carol’s stem cells, given the collective’s “specific” understanding of agency.\n\nGilligan notes of the dubious governing rules of the Others’ morality: “But, maybe, if the eggs had already been fertilized, they wouldn’t have been able to, right? Because they can’t [actively interfere]. Boy, that opens up [a whole can of worms]. We talked many, many, many hours about this stuff. It’s a quagmire.”\n\nAll episodes of Pluribus are streaming on Apple TV.

Just months later, the 74-year-old actor found himself promoting three major studio projects: Mike Flanagan’s life-affirming fantasy drama “The Life of Chuck” (streaming Dec. 26 on Hulu), the adaptation of Stephen King’s “The Long Walk” and now “The SpongeBob Movie: Searching for SquarePants,” in which Hamill voices the ghoulish Flying Dutchman.\n\n“You can’t really control it, but this was a really, really active year,” Hamill tells Variety. “I don’t have anything lined up, so maybe next year won’t be so active.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHamill weighed the idea of retirement after reprising Luke Skywalker in the “Star Wars” sequel trilogy, wanting to hang up his cape while the going was still good. “As much as an actor appreciates a good entrance,” he says, “you want to find a way to end your career in a way where you can hold your head high.”\n\n\n\nThat outlook shifted when Mike Flanagan offered him a part in “The Fall of the House of Usher,” which reignited his excitement for the craft. “It was a character part that would’ve been routine in voiceover,” Hamill said. “In voiceover, they don’t care what you look like, so you’re going to play many roles you’d never get on camera. They cast with their ears, not their eyes.”\n\n\n\nNow firmly in his third act, voice acting has allowed Hamill to keep playing those juicy roles untethered from age or physicality. But as AI reshapes Hollywood, he remains wary of how his legacy — especially in future Disney’s “Star Wars” projects — will live on. “It’s hard to predict the future,” Hamill says, “but I may have to ask my family if they want me in a Star Wars movie 30 years from now after I’m gone.”\n\n\n\nWith Variety, Hamill discusses his approach to the Flying Dutchman, moving on from “Star Wars,” and why he quit Facebook.\n\nYou’ve had quite the year.\n\n\n\nYeah. When it rains, it pours.\n\n\n\nHow are you reflecting on the year as a whole? The Palisades fire in January, all these big movies — it’s been a lot of ups and downs.\n\nIt’s remarkable. I’m in the business of escapism, and if I can take people’s minds off the horrible headlines — especially for those affected by the fires — then I’ve done my job. A lot of things are unexpected. I did a show years ago called “Regular Show.” It has a cult following, but it ran for eight seasons. I’ve never been on a show that comes back. We did 40 new episodes, and they want to do 40 more.\n\n\n\nBefore “The SpongeBob Movie” starts, there’s this five-minute “Ninja Turtles” short that plays. Did you see it?\n\n\n\nI did.\n\n\n\nIt pokes fun at society’s over-reliance on ChatGPT. Has it been unsettling seeing AI-generated videos of you or Luke Skywalker? I saw one the other week of Luke talking to Ben Kenobi’s Force Ghost and couldn’t believe how realistic it looked.\n\nI haven’t seen that. Is it live-action or animated?\n\n\n\nIt’s live-action. It plays like a deleted scene from “Return of the Jedi.”\n\nGee, I haven’t seen that. It’s one of those things where there’s a disconnect between the fan world and myself, in the sense that every actor does the job, and when the job is completed, they move on to the next project. They don’t really hang on to it. And yet, “Star Wars” is such a vital ongoing franchise. [Disney] is doing really well, and obviously, they’ve done more material since I left. But I had my time. Now I’m just a fan. I love “Rogue One,” “Mandalorian,” “Andor.” They’re doing great without me.\n\n\n\nDisney has a new partnership with OpenAI, where fans will now be able to generate short videos using characters from the “Star Wars” universe. How does that sit with you?\n\nIt’s fascinating to see it develop, and I’m also apprehensive about how it will be used. The story of the AI-generated actress that got signed by a major agency is mind-boggling. Is she going to stay 33, or whatever her age is, forever? It’s obviously hard to predict the future, but I guess I’m gonna have to talk to my family about if they want me to be in a “Star Wars” movie 30 years from now after I’m gone.\n\n\n\nIt’s cool to hear you lend your voice to The Flying Dutchman. How did you approach that iconic laugh, especially given comparisons to the Joker?\n\nWhen I accepted the offer to be the Flying Dutchman, I thought it was a new character created just for this movie. I start to do my homework, and it’s a character that’s been done for years by Brian Doyle-Murray. I’ve been a fan of his since “Saturday Night Live.” I loved him on Chris Elliott’s show “Get a Life.” He’s just terrific. But I was too intimidated to listen to what he had done. I thought I’d better do my version, and I’ll listen to his later. With a character like a ghost pirate in the world of “SpongeBob,” you can go as big as you want. It’s like children’s theater. There is no too big.\n\nIn terms of the Joker, when you’re in the head of the character, I didn’t see the parallels. Now that I’m sort of distanced from it, I can see how people find comparisons between the two. I love both characters in different ways, and they’re both fun to play.\n\n\n\nCertain actors choose the route of retirement, but you’ve stayed incredibly active. Do you think you could retire?\n\nA few years ago, I started thinking, “I’ve done a lot, maybe it’s time to make a dignified exit.” As much as an actor appreciates a good entrance, you want to find a way to end your career in a way where you can hold your head high. The real turning point for me was meeting Trevor Macy and Mike Flanagan about “The Fall of the House of Usher.” That made me excited about performing again because it was a character part that would’ve been routine in voiceover. In voiceover, they don’t care what you look like, so you’re going to play many roles you’d never get on camera. They cast with their ears, not their eyes.\n\nYou can’t really control it, but this was a really, really active year. I don’t have anything lined up, so maybe next year won’t be so active. When you’re in your 20s and 30s, it’s hard to think of yourself in your 50s and 60s, but I certainly didn’t think I’d be on camera as long as I’ve been.\n\n\n\nAre there any dreams you haven’t achieved yet?\n\nI wanted to go to Broadway, I did that. I’ve wanted to do animation ever since I found out that people did animated voices. In grade school, I saw Clarence Nash do Donald Duck on a Walt Disney show, and I really zeroed in on all my favorite shows. I learned who Mel Blanc was. I loved “Rocky and Bullwinkle.” I’d go to the record stores to look at the back of the record albums to write down the names of the actors — because we didn’t have the internet, you couldn’t Google it. It was something I aspired to.\n\nIt’s a very unique job, and doing the Flying Dutchman is one of the reasons I love being an actor. And the fact that I got to play it in live-action segments. I mean, it was crazy fun. If people have even a fraction of the good time that I’m having doing this character, they’re in for the time of their lives.\n\nThey say in the movie that SpongeBob has the purest heart of an innocent. Before SpongeBob, that was Luke Skywalker for a lot of people. What gravitates you towards these optimistic characters?\n\nI never forget the fact that we are in the business of escapism. These are troubled times. The movie is therapeutic in that regard. You go to something like “The SpongeBob Movie,” you leave all your troubles behind. It’s healthy in troubling times to have an escape.\n\nGeorge Lucas mastered that escapism, but at its core, “Star Wars” is a very anti-authoritarian story.\n\nWell, that’s the thing. It’ll work on different levels, depending on your age. And you’re right about George. The original “Star Wars” was an allegory commenting on the Vietnam War. So there’s the resistance, the rebels, the Empire. It’s surprisingly relevant when you consider what’s going on in our country today.\n\nYou’re in the business of entertainment, but you’ve also stayed very connected to politics and charities. Why is that important to you?\n\nIf you’ve been lucky enough to be able to do what you love and make a living at it, you have a responsibility to pay back as best you can. That’s why I love Make-A-Wish, and that’s what I use social media for. I’m not really overtly political on talk shows, but more so on Bluesky and Instagram. I left Twitter the day after the election because I didn’t want to support anything that Elon Musk is involved in. I left Facebook in 2016 because I didn’t like the way Zuckerberg handled Hillary. But who cares that I left Facebook? It’s a real lesson that you’re only one voice in a country of over 300 million. So, get a grip and don’t take yourself too seriously.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 17:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T17:44:06.474573"}

She considers all 15 of those records to be reflective of where she was in the year leading up to the season, and the fact that home-and-hearth look a little different for her in 2025 is duly reflected in “Christmas Unhinged.”\n\nThe title of this year’s release is a reference to Hinge, which has been Chan’s post-divorce dating app of choice this past year. She could have gone with something a little cornier, because, as she jokes, “This chapter is called ‘Single Bells, Single All the Way.'”\n\nIn all seriousness, Chan says, “I felt like I could really speak to everyone that listens to my Christmas music and Christmas music lovers everywhere to understand what kind of Christmas I was having this year, and why it’s OK to live Christmas not just in, like, a snow globe of time, but as an actual living, lived experience.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPerhaps you’re familiar with Chan for the legend that has built up around her as the only artist of note to have devoted her recorded output exclusively to Christmas music, which was a hot take a decade ago, let alone 15 years into her unbroken streak. Or perhaps you became aware of her as the artist who put up a challenge to Mariah Carey, and prevailed; Carey attempted to trademark the term “Queen of Christmas,” and Chan went to court to block it, contending that she had also been using it or had it applied to her going back as many or more years. (Carey eventually stopped further action in the trademark pursuit, leading the judge to dismiss it and leave the slogan in the public domain.) If you’re unfamiliar with any of those parts of Chan’s story, you can retrace the footprints through the snow via previous Variety articles, including this origin story.\n\nBut for 2025, we had a very-late-in-the-season catchup with Chan about whether “Christmas Unhinged” is officially a divorce album, and what it’s been like to return the dating field and eventually have to explain to all possible suitors just what it is that she’s known for.\n\nThe answer might be evident to anyone who knows you, but the question is: Why put out a Christmas album that reflects your divorce?\n\nThis is definitely new emotional territory for me. But if you step back and look at all 15 chapters of my life in Christmas music, what makes my Christmas music so distinctive is that at the end of the year where we’re all taking inventory of where we are in our milestones of living, I curate my albums to capture the snapshot of where I am. And if I’m getting divorced, there are millions of other people just like me, who are facing the holidays without their spouse or without their family members as they know it, or their traditions have been upended. I’m not the only one. So it’s a tremendous honor to be able to create the kind of Christmas songs that are lacking if we only hold onto “A Holly Jolly Christmas.” I can grow with my Christmas canon and share some songs that might inspire others to embrace all of the holiday season — the good, the bad and the unknown.\n\nWould you go so far as to call this your Christmas divorce record?\n\nI think that last year was more my Christmas divorce record, with the album I called “Shatterproof.” I actually filed for divorce last year and I was going through so much internal turmoil, but I wasn’t ready to share it all yet. I processed the impending end of my marriage in the last album as safely as I could process it. I only do Christmas music, but this is how I process my emotions as an artist; it’s very cathartic to me. “Christmas Unhinged” is what happens once I decided to be divorced and embark on rediscovering myself, not focusing so much on the pain of divorce, but the opportunity of becoming who I’m meant to be in the second act of my life. As a single mom, it’s a beautiful thing. You know, divorce starts very sad, but there’s so much opportunity, because once you’ve been so down, the only place you can go is up, and I’ve never felt more myself in many years than I do right now.\n\nYou have talked on your social media about what it’s like to date now as the self-proclaimed Queen of Christmas and how men react to that.\n\nEspecially while I was dating people during the beginning of the Christmas season, which is around September, I started to get really nervous, because this is when I cannot hide this aspect of my life. First of all, I have not even dated in 20 years. So when I had to start even contemplating going out on dates again, and then downloading an app, going through hundreds and hundreds of random pictures and trying to decide, “Hey, do I wanna date you, Random Picture?,” it’s the weirdest thing in the whole world, right? And I got very, very frustrated in the process. So I ended up writing a non-Christmas song called “Love Me Right or Leave Me Alone,” which is sincerely my Hinge-dating mission-status song.\n\nAlso, I did a Beatles cover on this record, “Something,” because I feel like there wasn’t a proper female version of that song. And as I was meeting new guys and going on all these dates, I’d be like, “Oh yeah, there’s something about him.” And then I sang it for myself and I put it on Hinge as my mating call.\n\nYou got your Beatles on with this record, doubly, because you also covered John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” which you retitled “Happy Ex-mas.”\n\nI do covers only if they transform in the way that I relate to lyrics. When I got divorced, I started to really think about the lyrics to that song, and the one lyric that really helped me in the studio get through all of my pain of divorce was the lyric “War is over if you want it.” Right when you’re in the middle of a divorce, those words are so powerful. And so that is really a message to my ex-husband. Which is not the original intent of the song. But having sung it the way that I did and even retitling it “Happy Ex-Mas” — sorry, Yoko, if you’re not happy about that! — the way that it came out was super cathartic.\n\nGoing back to your dating experiences this year, what was it like to tell people what you are famous for?\n\nI’ve dated tons of different types of people from all ethnicities and creeds and cultures, and they get to know me as Elizabeth, and they’ll connect with me if they’re also going through divorce or if they’re single parents. But sometimes the minute that they find out I’m the queen of Christmas, it’s like a needle drops. It’s like, “What does this mean? Do you know I’m Jewish?” or something like that, and I’m like, yeah, it doesn’t matter. But it can become very challenging to people. It’s just been pure comedy.\n\nMaybe they imagine it’s like the Tim Allen movie, and they think they will date you and then they suddenly turn into Santa Claus and grow a big beard and belly.\n\nI feel like the only person who would’ve really tolerated that would’ve been the Mormon potato farmer that I dated. I don’t know how I found this guy in New York. He would’ve been OK with turning into Santa, I’m pretty sure. I went on a coffee date with a Hare Krishna…\n\nI was gonna ask if you had run into any Christmas fetishists who might be really turned on by that part of you.\n\nThere was a request from somebody who was really convinced that I should expand into Christmas OnlyFans. And I knew very quickly that this guy was not the guy for me. So yes, I encountered that guy. It was a very awkward conversation because I think he was quite serious about it.\n\nYou make it sound, though, like you’ve had fun this year, going through that process, as confounding as it is to someone coming back into the dating world in the age of apps.\n\nI have to step back and laugh because the whole ridiculousness of dating in this day and age is so unlike how I remember dating back in the day, where you would go to a bar and then maybe get someone’s number and start dating, and then it was just that person until it faded out. Now it doesn’t even feel like dating; it feels like a messed-up video game. The worst term we had back then was fading out on somebody. Now we’ve got rostering, we’ve got ghosting, we have submarining, we have breadcrumbing, we have all kinds of stuff. You know how in Alaska they have a thousand names for snow? In dating, there’s a thousand names for disinterest.\n\nWait, you are going to have to explain some of these terms, to someone who is not out in the field. “Ghosting” I get, but what were some of the others you mentioned?\n\n“Rosters” means when people have more than one person that they date casually… “Submarining” is not quite ghosting, which is where someone just completely goes like the Ghost of Christmas Past on you and they just disappear and there’s no explanation. Submarining is when they kind of go down into the depths of the ocean and you have no idea where they are, and then like maybe a week later or two weeks later, they come back up. It’s like, “Hey, what’s up? I was just down in the ocean. Sorry I couldn’t talk to you. I was in the abyss.”\n\nTimes have indeed changed…\n\nAnd a lot of these profiles are AI-generated. I might be falling in love with robots.\n\nBack on the music: Do you ever consider taking a year off between Christmas albums? Or would that ruin what you’ve got going?\n\nNever. What, you’re asking me now, 15 years in? You could have asked me this eight years in.\n\nJust wondering if it’s ever been a temptation to skip a year, or like in college, taking a gap year.\n\nI think the closest thing to a gap year that I had was when I broke my spine and I couldn’t sing. I had a meeting with my musicians and my co-producers and managers and I let them know that I physically could not stand because I was paralyzed from the left leg down. and I couldn’t even breathe. I had no stability of my diaphragm because I had broken my L1 to L5. I was crying and my daughter was sitting next to me and she was like, “No, mommy, I’m gonna help you sing.” And then my friend Dave Eggar, when I floated around that maybe that might be the year that I wouldn’t be able to do something, was like, “There’s no way.” We always figure it out. So my team around me reminds me, “No, Elizabeth, you have a greater purpose. You must tell your story every Christmas.” I really owe it to my friends in this business who remind me that at the end of the day, I’m an artist, and as an artist, my perspective informs my inspiration, and my inspiration is through my Christmas music. They constantly remind me that what I do is very different, and they’ll hold that space for me and remind me that you’re not allowed to not celebrate a Christmas.\n\nIt’s like me asking you: Are you gonna skip a Christmas this year? Have you ever skipped a Christmas?\n\nYou know, I have not.\n\nNo. Right? So why would I? I mean, I know I do a little extra than you do, but I’m not gonna not celebrate Christmas, and the way that I celebrate Christmas is just the way that I celebrate it, is like, you know, producing new songs and coming up with new albums and presenting them to the world and telling my story one Christmas at a time. Why would I not want to do that?\n\nI got behind in thinking about the season, and I did not put any lights up till the 22nd this year, but I feel like this conversation has helped me round a corner.\n\nSee, my magic powers prevail. I’m sure that you know if you need some Christmas backup, all you have to do is call and ask. I am the Queen of Christmas. Like, I know some people.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:09:57 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T18:39:09.540099"}

No theme rings more true than in Ariel Mahler’s short film Re-Entry, a masterclass character study that artfully weaves the tender and cerebral in a tale of reconciliation with past regrets and the overwhelming power of self-love. The story follows a transgender NASA scientist, Maya (Danielle Squyres), who rediscovers a lost satellite she launched 35 years earlier. Though excited by the potential recovery of the satellite, Maya finds herself still haunted by the memory of her painful, closeted past (younger Maya, played by Tirosh Schneider) and what she perceives to be the humiliating end of her career.

Then, what’ll happen even more decades later, the satellite will reemerge and essentially come back to life and start communicating again, hence the zombie satellite name. So, when I was looking at this video, it had a real emotional impact on me because it was a language that resonated with me as a trans person. The TikToker was talking about these satellites floating, lost in the wrong orbit, searching for the ability to communicate after they’ve lost it, and then something happens where they’re able to reemerge and begin communicating again. They find their orbit and their orientation. And, I was just like, “Yep, that tracks. I’ve had all of those experiences in my own personal life.”\n\nSo, when I saw this video, I imagined that it would be like creating a character who lives as a metaphor for the satellite. This trans woman, who has for a long time felt like she’s lost in the wrong orbit, is floating, searching for her community, when something inspires her to re-engage and re-enter her own life, essentially. Re-Entry is a story about reconciling with your past and making terms with who you once were, as it impacts who you are now. And I think that everybody probably can relate to the experience of thinking about your past and thinking about choices you made or things you did or things you didn’t do that impact who you are today, and that you maybe regret or you have complicated feelings about. And for queer and trans people, we tend to have a very complicated relationship with our past. So, I wanted to use this metaphor as a vehicle to explore our relationship with the past and how we integrate it.\n\nDEADLINE: What were some cinematic influences for your short?\n\nMAHLER: One of my favorite genres is emotional sci-fi films. Some of the biggest reference points for me are Arrival, Contact and Interstellar. They are all films that use science as a vehicle to tell a deep, emotional story about whatever situation the character is facing. So, me and my cinematographer watched those.\n\nDEADLINE: I’m fascinated by the way you tell the story. You have two different actors playing the same character: one, the younger male presenting version of Maya, and the other, the older version of Maya. Talk a bit more about this concept of both of them being in communication with each other onscreen.\n\nMAHLER: It wasn’t always that way. In the creative writing process, I struggled with [how to convey inner turmoil]. I knew the story’s foundation was an older trans woman who rediscovers a satellite she helped launch and is now forced to decide, “Do I return to NASA as my new self?” So, I knew that there had to be another person involved in that because I didn’t want her to just be alone wandering around having this monologue. So, I really struggled with who is the best person to bring into this world and to interrupt the status quo of how she lives her life. There was a version where her coworker, George (Robert Dowdy/Leon A. Walker), came in much earlier, and it was actually him who showed up and said, “Hey, we found the satellite.” And then she had to deal with, “Do I out myself to him? How does this go?” There was a version where it was a young NASA intern who came over to try to get her to come back to NASA. There were all these different versions of it.\n\nAnd then I was thinking about, I want this to be the most coherent and specific conflict possible. So, who is Maya actually struggling with? Who is she most at odds with? And I realized, oh, it’s herself. And then I also realized, oh, this is a film, so I can sort of bend reality a little. Not too much, but realistic enough to tell this story. So, the idea of bringing her former self back evolved through that very slow process. It was something I was a little nervous about at first because I think a lot of trans people tend to have complicated relationships with our past, as I said earlier. One of those complexities is that it can be hard to reckon with former versions of ourselves. Trans people sometimes even use the phrase dead name to refer to their former self as if their previous self is literally dead. I’ve always struggled with that because on one hand, I understand that. Looking at old photos of myself, I found it challenging and struggled to a certain extent.\n\nBut on the other hand, I actually have a lot of love and compassion for my younger self, because I think about it as, “They were just trying to do the best they could in a world that was telling them they had to be a very specific type of person.” I remember that the idea of putting the characters face-to-face felt scary, but it was also another reason why I was like, that means it’s the right thing to do, because if I’m afraid of it, I’m a bit like, this is risky, then that feels like exactly the right place to go.\n\nRe-Entry AFI / Ariel Mahler\n\nDEADLINE: How much of this short film is you?\n\nMAHLER: I’ll answer this first by going back to the film at hand. When I decided to bring the younger Maya into the world, I struggled. I was really trying to figure out who was going to go back to NASA and who was anti-going back to NASA. Originally, it was flipped from the film version. Older Maya was the one who was like, “I found the data, I want to go back,” and younger Maya was like, “No, you can’t. You can’t let them see you like this.” Then that was the push-and-pull dynamic, but it flipped. The reason that this feels relevant to your question, I think, is part of the challenge and also catharsis of making this movie is that it was a messy process. It’s messy to think about my past. On one hand, I want to grab the former me and shake them by the shoulders and be like, “What are you doing? Stop lying to everybody. Stop lying to yourself. Take control of your destiny. It’s not worth spending all of this time being miserable.”\n\nThere’s also some anger that I feel towards my younger self and love, shame, empathy and just the whole rainbow of human emotions. When a film is so deeply personal, it can be really challenging to drill down into the core thing [you’re trying to communicate]. Because it’s a short film, I only have 15 minutes to say one very specific thing, and there’s so much that I could say on this topic. Trying to nail down one specific thing made it really challenging but energizing.\n\nThe other piece that feels relevant to your question is my journey as a filmmaker. This is obviously a very trans story with a trans narrative, but, as a storyteller, it’s also important to me to tell stories that are not “just trans.” I never want it to be where the only conflict is coming out, or the only conflict is trans identity. So, for this short film, putting Maya in the realm of this scientific world was meaningful to me because she’s not just trans, she’s a scientist. She’s a NASA astronomer. She has a whole career that she’s been working her entire life for.\n\nIn the same way that I’m not just trans, I’m a filmmaker and an artist, and I have a career I’m building. So those two things feel deeply connected. But when I think about past me, I’m thinking about it in relation to my gender. I’m also thinking about the regrets I have. I knew I wanted to be a filmmaker when I was four years old, stealing my dad’s camcorder and making dumb little movies with my friends, yet I was afraid to embrace it fully. I was like, “Well, that’s not practical,” throughout high school and college. I opted to be more traditional. Then it wasn’t until I was almost 30 that I really embraced filmmaking. So, I look at former me and think about where my career would probably be now, if I had started back in high school or whatever.\n\nDEADLINE: How did you find your two leads in younger and older Maya?\n\nMAHLER: It was a very interesting challenge that I set up for myself, because I knew that I, one, had to cast a trans woman as a lead, and two, someone who was at least 50 years old, plus, because authentic casting is really important to me. But, unfortunately, there just aren’t a lot of visible older trans women actresses. And this isn’t because they aren’t out there, but because they just haven’t really been given the opportunity to get work or be seen. So, thankfully, Danielle Squyres was part of an acting group in LA called ActNOW, which is a program for queer and trans people. I have some friends who are also involved in that, and one of them, my friend Sasha Forests, knew Danielle and connected us. So, I brought her in for the audition process, and I knew she was the one. She has a really beautiful subtlety and was also really able to capture that external shell. But then, inside, you can sense the vulnerability and rawness.\n\nFor younger Maya, that was a new challenge, because I cast Danielle first, so I needed to find someone who vaguely resembled her. It was still about authenticity casting; I wanted somebody who had at least some personal understanding of queer and trans identity. So, I didn’t just want to necessarily cast a straight cisgender man who has no personal experience with that, but at the same time, I didn’t fully want to cast a trans woman and ask her to completely detransition herself for this student film. So, I was like, “How do I balance this?” Thankfully, I met Tirosh [Schneider] through a mutual friend, and they identify as non-binary and gender queer. They were comfortable presenting as a male at the time but are very much in the queer world and know what the experience of feeling othered by your gender is like, so that felt important.\n\nAlso, I do think, from a spiritual perspective, once you begin the journey of making a film, there’s a call in the universe, or God, or whoever you pull your power from, that magic conspires to put all the pieces into place. And the fact that I met Danielle, Tirosh and Robert, who plays George, all these people came into my life at the exact moment when I needed to find them. It was a beautiful experience.\n\nRe-Entry AFI/Ariel Mahler\n\nDEADLINE: You’ve shown this film on the festival circuit. What has the reception been like so far?\n\nMAHLER: We’ve been lucky and have had great feedback. We’ve been going to festivals for a year and a half now, which is awesome and exciting. The most meaningful thing to me is when specifically trans people come up to me and feel really seen by this story, because I do think that anytime you’re putting something out that is vulnerable, there’s a bit of fear. I didn’t know how trans people were going to respond to this younger self idea of putting a physical form of this woman’s younger [male-presenting] self. And a lot of the trans people that I’ve spoken to feel really seen and emotionally resonant with that story, so that means a lot. We’ve also been able to screen it for some students and young people, and having younger trans folks come up to me and say they were touched by and appreciate this story is meaningful to me because I never had that when I was young.\n\nDEADLINE: What would you like people to take away from this short?\n\nMAHLER: For me, I’ve learned that I would often go back in order to move forward. We have to look backwards and engage with our past. Engaging with the past can be scary, uncomfortable and vulnerable, but that’s exactly why we have to face that hard truth. It’s only through actively engaging with our past and making terms with our journey that we’re able to move forward.\n\n[This interview has been edited for length and clarity]", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:34:16 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T18:39:10.107372"}

A memo doubling down on a controversial decision that has roiled the Paramount Skydance news unit and drawn torrents of criticism.\n\nIn a note to staff sent hours before the start of Christmas Eve, CBS News Editor in Chief Bari Weiss, President Tom Cibrowski and new senior editors Charles Forelle and Adam Rubenstein insisted a move to delay a “60 Minutes” report by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi was enacted “to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.” The signatures on the memo mark what is believed to be the first tacit appearance of a new CBS News editorial “masthead” that Weiss expects to get more entrenched in the newsgathering process at the company, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n“Right now, the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press. It isn’t because they’re crazy,” the memo read. “To win back their trust, we have to work hard. Sometimes that means doing more legwork. Sometimes it means telling unexpected stories. Sometimes it means training our attention on topics that have been overlooked or misconstrued. And sometimes it means holding a piece about an important subject to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCBS News revealed over the weekend that a “60 Minutes” segment reported by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi and centered on the on-screen accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to prison in El Salvador had been shelved just hours before Sunday’s broadcast. As disclosed by an email sent to colleagues by Alfonsi, the decision was made by Weiss, who insisted that Trump officials appear in the report to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi’s team had made good faith efforts to secure response ahead of filing the report for legal review. “The public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” Alfonsi said in her memo.\n\nWeiss has, since her arrival in October, insisted without presenting evidence that mainstream media has lost Americans’ trust. And yet, a September study from Pew Research Center showed that CBS News enjoyed the backing of 51% of U.S. adults who have at least some trust in the information they get from national news organizations. CBS was ranked on par with CNN and PBS, and just a few percentage points behind ABC News and NBC News.\n\n\n\nSuch decision making ” may seem radical,” the new memo said. “Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week. And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”\n\nThe “60 Minutes” imbroglio grips CBS News and its parent at an extremely inopportune moment. The news unit is just days away from trying to launch Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of “CBS Evening News,” and looks to be doing so without the weeks of pre-launch promotion such a move would normally warrant. Instead, Dokoupil will go on a barnstorming tour of the U.S. and visit many cities and towns during his first days on the air. What’s more, Paramount is engaged in a heated battle with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and a continuing series of gaffes under Weiss’ management casts a cloud over Paramount CEO David Ellison’s ability to manage the coropration.\n\nMany staffers are aghast over Weiss decision, noting that it came at the end of a long vetting process and after CBS News had already promoted the “60 Minutes” segment to the public. Indeed, many people have been able to watch the report on their own because a Canadian media outlet which airs “60 Minutes” made Alfonsi’s report available via digital means. Should a new version of the story surface on the newsmagazine, viewers will be able to see how it was changed under Weiss’ supervision. According to people familiar with the report, Alfonsi had already made efforts to seek comment from Trump officials, and had included a video snippet from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that offered the administration’s take on the topic.\n\n\n\nMore to come….", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 19:38:05 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T19:40:45.304377"}

I love Carol’s abrasiveness. I love how she responds to the end of the world not with high-minded heroism, but a self-centered defiance rooted in grief — a solipsism encouraged by how the hive mind caters to her every request. I love how Carol is tough enough to spend over a month on her own when the hive mind abandons Albuquerque rather than endure Carol’s efforts to undo their joining, but human enough to relent and give acquiescence a try in the season finale. (Humanity and its attendant flaws are in scarce supply in “Pluribus.”) I believe Carol is a truly great TV character, brought to life by a truly great TV actor in Rhea Seehorn.\n\nNot everyone seems to agree. “Pluribus” is the third series from Vince Gilligan, the showrunner who earned himself a permanent place in his chosen medium’s Mount Rushmore with the back-to-back triumphs of “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul.” Both those series focused on ascendant figures in New Mexico’s narcotics trade, an exciting hook that belied Gilligan’s evident fascination with the detailed gruntwork between violent confrontations. I always think of Jonathan Banks’s Mike Ehrmantraut silently disassembling his car, part by individual part, in search of a tracker over several minutes of screentime in an early season of “Saul.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nApple’s largesse allows “Pluribus” to expand Gilligan’s purview to Las Vegas, South America and other far-flung locales, but also practice his preferred MO with a heightened focus. “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” — particularly the latter — could be rigorous, but they also distributed that rigor across a wide-ranging ensemble. In her Gilligan-verse debut, Seehorn’s Kim Wexler was just one of many fastidious obsessives in and around the Albuquerque underworld, joining kindred spirits like Mike and chicken-slash-meth kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). In “Pluribus,” Carol and the hive mind are pretty much all we have, give or take a few fellow survivors like gleeful hedonist Mr. Diabaté (Samba Schutte) and Manousos Oviedo (Carlos-Manuel Vesga), who spends much of Season 1 holed up in a Paraguayan storage facility.\n\nThat puts pressure on both Carol as audience surrogate and the viewer asked to train their attention on a single person’s response to a global cataclysm. Lengthy scenes show Carol doggedly investigating the hive’s source of nutrition (Human Derived Protein, which is exactly what it sounds like), or Manousos studying radio frequencies and noting his findings by hand. Especially in the hive’s absence, “Pluribus” is quiet, deliberate, patient — and for some, those qualities cross the line into “boring.” Writing for The New Republic, critic Philip Maciak pronounced the show “a bit of a snooze,” echoing many complaints on social media about the hive’s noisy, chaotic genesis giving way to the placidity of a status quo where almost everyone is quite literally of one mind.\n\nClearly, I disagree. I can point to certain objective factors in Gilligan’s defense: “Pluribus” balances out the indulgence of languid scene-to-scene pacing with sub-50 minute runtimes and a nine-episode season; the show’s visual panache works against a sense of monotony, like a dumpster-diving sequence directed by frequent Gilligan collaborator Gordon Smith that gives the grossest of tasks uncanny color and symmetry. (Cinematographers Marshall Adams and Paul Donachie seem to bask in the desert sun.) But mostly, I think how you feel about “Pluribus” comes down to how you feel about Carol, and your investment in the trajectory she takes from closeted, self-loathing romantasy author to airlifting an atom bomb onto Manousos’s doorstep.\n\nThe premise of “Pluribus” is abstract and allegorical by design, and Gilligan has said in interviews he prefers to leave interpretation to his audience. While the hive’s parallels to AI are uncanny — they even respond to prompts! — I’m partial to the most literal of readings. Millions of people don’t survive the process of assimilation into the hive, and Carol’s wife Helen (Miriam Shor) is one of the casualties. Carol is in mourning, and many of her most extreme, impulsive or just unsavory actions arise from that fact. So does our empathy for her.\n\nIn losing Helen, Carol has lost the one person on Earth who saw and accepted her for who she really was: her curmudgeonly qualities, but also the basic fact of her sexuality, which Carol hid from the public by making the romantic lead of her popular Wycaro series a man. Part of what makes the hive mind so eerie is how it’s able to provide a hollow facsimile of such intimacy. The hive absorbed Helen’s memories before she died, and deploys this knowledge in alternately earnest and manipulative ways. (Much of “Pluribus” operates from a place of ambiguity about The Joining and its consequences. That Human Derived Protein? It’s a last resort because the hive can’t kill what’s currently alive, so must make use of the dead for nutrition — no matter the species). Zosia (Karolina Wydra), the individual the hive deploys as its emissary to Carol, is chosen because she looks exactly like the romantic lead of Carol’s novels, before the character was genderbent into a man to reach a broader audience.\n\nThough “Pluribus” is a science fiction show, it eschews the mystery box structure deployed by so many of its genre peers. Questions remain about the hive, its motives and its mechanics, but they’re secondary to how Carol feels about the Joining and how she responds to it. For every new detail we learn about the hive, there’s a Carol-focused revelation like her painful history with anti-gay conversion therapy, which tells us all we need to know about her near-allergic reaction to the prospect of being forcibly assimilated into a dominant majority group. The hive’s unconscious natural instinct is to absorb whoever it can, and when Carol notes this fact on her whiteboard, she puts it in understandably personal terms: “Wants to CHANGE ME” — the last two words underlined. Carol’s precious safe harbor has been inverted into her worst fear, an abstract anxiety “Pluribus” renders concrete as only great horror, and horror-adjacent character studies, can.\n\nIn the last couple episodes of “Pluribus,” Carol’s resolve is tested, as any hero’s must be. She experiments with using the hive, as Diabaté has, to manifest her deepest desires. Carol sleeps with Zosia, asks her to use “I” pronouns instead of the hive’s preferred “we” and generally performs coupled domesticity. (Carol and Helen went to an ice hotel; Carol and Zosia go skiing.) This results in an amusing reversal wherein Manousos, who’s traveled thousands of miles in search of another skeptic, is just as appalled by Carol’s willing self-delusion as Carol once was by people like Laxmi (Menik Gooneratne), who refuses to acknowledge the obvious change in her own son. Carol is shocked out of her complacency only after learning that the hive has obtained her stem cells without her consent — from frozen eggs, so she could have a child with Helen — and could absorb her within the month.\n\nThe big shift in the “Pluribus” finale isn’t in our understanding of the hive, whose intentions were already shared. It’s within Carol, who chooses to ally herself with a fellow misanthrope in Manousos as unlikely saviors of mankind. I think there’s something beautiful in Gilligan employing such abundant resources, from tracking down and casting a Quechua speaker to shooting in the Canary Islands, in service of one person’s internal evolution. I also understand why it’s not for everyone — though, in my less generous moments, I’m frustrated that a story centered on a queer woman seems to get a shorter leash than Gilligan’s previous work about men doing crimes. To me, though, enjoying “Pluribus” isn’t about eating one’s cultural vegetables. It’s about enjoying a strange, absurd, uncategorizable show that’s also thoughtful and restrained. And it’s about Carol Sturka, a highly specific person whose unease with others is nonetheless broadly accessible. I’d never exchange her spiky, pushy personality for permanent affability, and I understand why she wouldn’t either.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 19:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T19:40:45.684327"}

He was 60.\n\nHis death was announced by his family and confirmed to Deadline by his manager Andrea Pett-Joseph, who called Finn “the kindest , most joyful person in any room” and said the actor passed while surrounded by family and friends.\n\nFinn was diagnosed in 2022 with bladder cancer, which went into remission but later returned and metastasized. In the months prior to the actor’s death, Finn’s friends launched a GoFundMe page on behalf of the family to help defray medical costs. To date the page has raised more than $118,000 in donations.\n\nBorn in Evanston, Illinois, on July 31, 1965, Finn joined Chicago’s Second City and iO comedy troupes after graduating from Marquette University (where he became friends with future Saturday Night Live star Chris Farley) in 1987. His TV breakthrough came in the mid-1990s, when he landed recurring roles on The George Wendt Show and Murphy Brown. In 1998 he played the party-throwing character Joe Mayo in the memorable “The Reverse Peephole” episode of Seinfeld.\n\nOther TV roles included appearances on That ’70s Show, The King of Queens, two episodes of Friends (he played Dr. Roger), and several episodes of Third Rock From The Sun. He played the character Jim Frost on eight episodes in 2001 and 2002 of the comedy-drama Ed, and made episodic appearances on Yes, Dear, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Bernie Mac Show, Wizards of Waverly Place, 2 Broke Girls and The Goldbergs, among others.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018 Finn played nice-guy Bill Norwood on 23 episodes of The Middle, neighbor to the sitcom’s main characters the Hecks and good buddy of Neil Flynn’s Mike Heck. In 2012 and 2013, he played Bob Forman on 18 episodes of the Nickelodeon sitcom Marvin Marvin.\n\nOn the big screen, Finn appeared in the 2000 comedy Dude, Where’s My Car, I Love You, Beth Cooper, and It’s Complicated starring Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin.\n\nFinn is survived by wife Donna, and their children, Cassidy, Caitlin and Ryan, his parents and other family.\n\nIn a post on X, Finn’s friends and fellow comedians Brian Stack and Jeff Dye shared tributes. “One of the best dudes I knew with a PERFECT sense of humor,” wrote Dye.\n\nHeartbroken that our dear friend, Pat Finn, passed away. As kind as he was brilliantly hilarious. This video of him at our Chicago apartment in ‘96, making his baby daughter Cassidy pretend to drive a bus and do karate kicks is priceless.

However, as the film progresses, [&#8230;]", "content": "Foreboding title aside, one could reasonably begin watching Charlie Polinger’s “The Plague” and assume that it is a Y.A. coming of age drama— a modern-day “The 400 Blows” or a male “Welcome to the Dollhouse” about a group of teenaged boys spending their summer at a sleepaway water polo camp. However, as the film progresses, not only does its narrative get increasingly sinister, but the look and feel of the film subtly lull the audience away from a vivacious security and into the darkest psychological realms of early adolescence.\n\nBecause of the movie’s water polo camp setting, much of it takes place in and around an indoor pool. Anyone who has been to a YMCA in the early morning knows the harsh fluorescence of these environments. Accordingly, the film’s first two acts are brightly lit, appearing almost sterilized at times.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn the opening shot, the camera is fully submerged in the pool, introducing the first of many underwater shots as the boys jump into the water, their legs kicking around and disrupting the aquatic stillness. While the swimming pool’s chlorine-washed blue is unmistakable, cinematographer Steven Breckon says that he and Polinger were trying to avoid cliched underwater shots. “The classic underwater shot is a perfume commercial with a woman in flowy drapery clothing and there’s like a God light beam on it,” Breckon tells Variety. “That’s nowhere close to what we wanted this material to look like and we were actually kind of inspired by more of a deep focus, like a painting.”\n\nTo achieve the underwater shots, Breckon explains that the camera operator was beneath the surface, receiving instructions through speakers. “I could basically talk to him through a giant megaphone speaker that is placed underwater, so it was like garbled instructions and he would just nod the camera ‘yes’ or nod the camera ‘no’ to confirm that he heard me.”\n\nEven as the camera becomes less static, circling around the kids treading water, bobbing up and down with seeming serendipity, Breckon says that it was more carefully orchestrated than it appears. He says that the camera was “on a flotation rig that you can deflate to the perfect level where it’s sort of half in and half out. And by pushing it on the surface through those boys and having all the splashing going on, it has a very chaotic energy,” however, “it was very diagrammed out. There really wasn’t a lot of finding it in the moment because we just had to be so safe with the boys. You know, we had lifeguards on every corner of the frame.”\n\nThe sequence’s handheld look is complemented by its sound and score, which synchronously cuts in and out every time the camera submerges and resurfaces. “I’m pretty sure that the actual ducking of the sound of the music was done by Damien (Volpe) and Dave (Paterson) in the sound department. But I was there. I went for those sessions,” composer Johan Lenox tells Variety.\n\nWhile the cinematography slowly morphs from the deceptive brightness of a bildungsroman to a darkness of a horror movie over the course of the runtime, the music is consistently eerie from the beginning, cluing audiences that not all is well for this group of kids. “The music is scary, but it’s also like, insanely weird,” says Lenox. “We wanted to telegraph early that some goofy and insane shit is gonna happen.”\n\nThe foreboding energy is accented by music’s surreal, sometimes liminal qualities. “You’re just hearing me wailing into this microphone,” Lenox continues, noting that while the music is strange throughout, there are subtle escalations as the movie progresses. “I don’t think there’s a string instrument in the first third or half of the movie. And then these gritty, noisy sounds from string instruments start to creep in on top of the vocals and eventually supplant them just as the fun sort of stops,” explains Lenox. “Then also there are these tense swelling drone sounds pushing into these hallways and stuff like that. I think there’s a shorter one early in the movie and then there’s like a fucking three or four minute long one by the end.”\n\n“The Plague”’s sight and sound does have conspicuous breaks from its sinister mold. Notably, when the kids sneak out at night partway through the film, a handheld long take captures them partying in an alley.\n\n“That’s probably the scene that’s the most extreme version of what I describe as ‘the sandbox,’” says Breckon. “There’re these broad strokes that were very set up and diagrammed out, but then within that, it’s just chaos, letting them go every which way. In terms of actually approaching it, I was trying my best to get us to commit to a 180 degree plus area, thinking we’ll flip around and get the other side, but the kids were going in circles and doing everything, so it very quickly became a 360 area and that posed some challenges. As a cinematographer, you want everybody to be in the back light, and you don’t want moments of too much front light. So I was trying to keep up with that scene as it was unfolding in front of us, but there was no version of me being like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. This isn’t the way that I want it to look.’ Instead, it was like, ‘No, the kids are telling us what it needs to be.’”\n\nThe scene reaches a crescendo when one of the boys pops a CD into a boom box and an Italian pop song plays. While the song could easily be mistaken for an obscure, but fitting needle drop, it is still an original piece composed by Lenox for the film. “Let’s fucking write our own thing. Like, why not?” reflects Lenox, appreciating how that the film’s “sonic world is 90% of one thing and then this other thing that comes in. It’s intentional. It could not be more opposite to everything else. I really like it as a structure and shape.”\n\nThe song is titled “Corsa Notturna” and it features Italian vocals from a child. It is some of the only vocals in the soundtrack that do not belong to Lenox himself. The song returns once more at the end of the film, in a dance sequence that once again showcases innovative camera techniques.\n\nAs the main character dances freely, we spin with him until a unique effect takes hold and it seems as if the rotation is continuing while seamlessly cutting between the boy and his revolving prospective. Breckon, however, explains that the shot was not cut at all. The team created a rotating six-sided mirror that the actor was stationary inside of, allowing him to intermittently appear in the reverse shot while maintaining the outward-facing circular motion.\n\n“As he becomes part of the image, and it goes from the people looking at him to just him, he’s actually slowing down. He’s not himself spinning anymore, and he’s starting to take stock of the situation in the moment, but its contrasted by the fact that this mirror is spinning faster and faster,” says Breckon. It is a transfixing effect that closes the film, effectively encapsulating the story’s dizzying approach to self-acceptance.\n\nThe influences for “The Plague” are manifold. Between Breckon and Lenox, they mention taking inspiration from “Raw,” “Carrie” and “The Shining,” but also “Full Metal Jacket,” “8 ½” “The Dark Knight” and “Superbad” to shape the look and sound. The result is something wholly unique: a coming-of-age horror movie that explores the social, psychological and physical viscerality of growing up.\n\n“The Plague” debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May. IFC acquired its distribution rights in August and will release the film in theaters on Dec. 24.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T21:24:12.820965"}

He had wrapped his final directing gig — the 2013 “Mob City” episode “Red Light”— and moved with his wife to California’s Central Coast, where he could bask in the wake of an incredible filmography that included “The Shawshank Redemption,” “The Green Mile,” “The Mist,” episodes of “The Walking Dead,” “The Shield,” “Tales from the Crypt” and more.\n\nAbout a decade into retirement, however, Darabont received a call from his agent, informing him that Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of “Stranger Things,” were fans of his work. The feeling was mutual, as Darabont and his wife had binged the Netflix series’ first four seasons several times over. The agents set up a friendly meeting between them when the Duffers were still developing the show’s fifth and final season.\n\nShortly thereafter, Dan Trachtenberg, who was attached to direct two episodes of “Stranger Things 5,” dropped out due to a scheduling conflict with his next film, “Predator: Badlands.” In a Hail Mary, the Duffers offered Darabont to take Trachtenberg’s place, and after a week’s consideration, he decided to come out of retirement to join the “Stranger Things” team on set.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWinona Ryder as Joyce Byers and Noah Schnapp as Will Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDarabont, 66, directed Episodes 3 and 5 of the final season. Episode 3 released in with Volume 1 on Nov. 26. Titled “The Turnbow Trap,” the episode is packed with action and emotion in the Upside Down and the Rightside Up, showcasing a triumphant return for the director. Episode 5, titled “Shock Jock,” will kick off the three-episode second volume on Dec. 25. (The “Stranger Things” series finale releases in theaters and on Netflix Dec. 31.)\n\nBetween the volumes, Variety spoke with the director to hear about his experience working on “Stranger Things” and his return to the filmmaking craft after twelve years since he last sat in the director’s chair.\n\nWe heard that you were a fan of “Stranger Things” before you met the Duffer brothers. How did you get into the show?\n\nMy wife and I were fans of the show from early on. We actually had watched all four seasons three or four or maybe even five times. It was so good. Then one day out of the blue, my agent called me and said, “The agent in the office next to me represents the Duffer brothers, and he just wanted me to tell you that they’re big fans of yours.” I said, “That’s fantastic. That’s very flattering. I’m big fans of theirs.” So I thought, “Well, next time I’m in L.A., I’ll get together with them for lunch and just compliment them.” I also was fascinated to know where the heck they came from, because I never heard of the Duffer brothers before they created this huge success on Netflix. So I had lunch with them when I was down in L.A. and I think about a week later, my agent called me again and said they’re inviting you to come direct an episode.\n\nAnd what was your initial reaction to that?\n\nI hadn’t done it in a while, but they said it’s like riding a bicycle: You don’t forget. And they were right. From the first moment on set, there was nothing unfamiliar about the process for me, though it had been about 13 years. The one episode offer wound up being two episodes and six months in Atlanta. It was a hell of a great experience.\n\nThe Duffer brothers told us that you took about a week to consider the offer. What was going through your mind during that week and what made you want to accept?\n\nWell, once you’re retired, it’s bliss. My wife and I live on the Central Coast in Monterey, where we don’t have the pressures of Hollywood on our back. I’m enjoying life, and for once I’m no longer the workaholic that I was for almost 30 years in Hollywood. So I had to wrestle with that question and, of course, talk to my wife about it, because I wasn’t going to go to Atlanta unless she came also. I love being married, and I’m not going to be in some place for months without her. We also have five chihuahuas that we would have to take. It was kind of a big move, especially once it became two episodes. We were looking at six months living in a different place. When you’re young and single, it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re an old fart like me who has sunk roots in a community and is comfortable being an unemployed bum, you have to ask yourself “Do I really do this?” But ultimately, it was my love for the show and my wife’s love for the show that kind of overruled all those other concerns and we said, “What the heck? Let’s do it!” I’m glad we did.\n\nNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhile you were considering, were you allowed to read the scripts for the episodes that you would direct?\n\nYeah, they had sent me the scripts and I thought they were terrific. I asked for all of the scripts that they had written thus far so I could track what was going on in the whole thing. They were very generous with sending me those, as long as it was kept under strict secrecy. They’re not quite the nuclear codes, but they’re pretty close. The fascinating thing about our culture is how much people want to dig into this stuff instead of wait to be surprised by what they see on screen. I am the ultimate no-spoilers guy. When I was in junior high, I went to go see “Soylent Green” and some asshole fellow students told me before I went in, “Oh, Soylent Green is people.” I’ve never forgiven them. It’s part of the reason why I’m not on social media and I’m also reluctant to watch trailers. Too much is given away. If I have an interest in something, I want to enjoy it fresh.\n\nDid you notice anything different in the process of filmmaking returning to the director’s chair after 12 or 13 years?\n\nOh gosh, yeah. Only on “Mob City” did I finally transition from film to digital, and I ended up loving it. It helps a director so much because you don’t ever have to call a cut. Whenever a director calls cut, the energy on a set dissipates. Now you can just say, “Everybody back to one” and the energy remains where it needs to be. The actors remain in the same headspace as you roll three or four takes before calling cut. I love that aspect of it. Filmmakers have so many new tools now. [On “Stranger Things”] our DP was shooting with a techno crane, which can sometimes be frustrating, but can do brilliant things. Also the camera operator is no longer where you’d think he is. He’s not by the camera anymore, but often in some tent off to the side. Same with whoever’s pulling focus. They’re longer next to the camera all the time. So much has been outsourced to these technological devices.\n\n\n\nBut I have to praise this crew. They were absolutely wonderful across the board. A director’s relationship with their crew is very important to me, especially the DP and AD, and I had great on both. Brett Jutkiewicz was my DP and Lisa Rowe was my AD, and they were both fantastic. The Duffers know how to crew up a show, and some of these folks had been with them since Season 1. There were so many resources all around me that could help answer any question. It was a great, collaborative vibe.\n\nEpisode 3 has lots of emotional scenes, including heavy dialogues between Will (Noah Schnapp) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), Will and Robin (Maya Hawke) and Holly (Nell Fisher) and Henry (Jamie Campbell Bower). What was it like working with this ensemble to create those dramatic dynamics?\n\nI’ve always said that if you have the right actor, there’s not much that they need to hear from a director. I learned that on my very first theatrical feature, “The Shawshank Redemption.” Sometimes a director can get too much into an actor’s ear. Tim Robbins, for example, loves conversations with the director. Morgan Freeman does not. He’s a very intuitive, very instinctive actor, and does a brilliant work. Both of them do. I remember midway through the shoot, I was talking to Morgan about whatever scene we’re going to shoot next and I could see his eyes glazing over. He was just being very polite and listening to me, so I stopped myself and said, “Morgan, you really don’t need to hear this, do you?” and he goes “No, just tell me where to stand and how to turn. That kind of stuff.” From that moment on, I let him do his job. It was a great lesson for a first-time director. Every actor is different.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nDid the cast of “Stranger Things” prefer more dialogue and direction, or did most of them take control of their own performances? Or was there a mix?\n\nThey’d been doing it for so long, especially the youngsters who were around 10 when they started and now they’re young adults. They’ve been with these characters for half of their lives, so they’re pretty dialed in. There were little, physical things that needed direction, like when Dustin [Gaten Matarazzo] comes out of the van and drops this big bag of tools right in front of the lens. To have it fall exactly where the camera is going to land took a lot of practice and blocking. I think there were five takes or something. There were also things like Caleb [McLaughlin] running down the stairs after he’s thrown acetone at the Demogorgon. I needed him to pause and look back at a certain moment because I knew something was going to be added in post that needed an extra beat of time. You’re sort of doing all this calculus on set to make sure it can be cut together right. That’s usually where I get more specific and precise with an actor, but aside from that, they know their characters. As a director, my job is to provide the raw materials for what you need in the editing room and also to be head cheerleader on set. You’re cheering everybody on and encouraging them. A small bit of encouragement or recognition from the director can fuel you for another 24 hours of exhausting work\n\nHas this experience made you want to direct more, or are you comfortable returning to retirement?\n\nI really do love being retired. However, I also love being on a set with creative people, as long as I’m not fighting battles with some evil empire, studio, or network. I bless Netflix for being so supportive. If you have a good situation like that and it can be about the creative process, then its a pleasure. So my longwinded answer winds up being, it depends. If there’s a friendly situation and I’m excited enough about the material, then it’s certainly a possibility. I’m not ruling anything out, but it would have to be something special. “Stranger Things” was a special opportunity for me to be a small part of a very large, wonderful thing that so many people love. I’m grateful to the Duffers for that opportunity. It will always be a great memory working with them and that cast and crew. I will love seeing where their careers take them. They all have such potential and they’re such good people.\n\nI know you don’t like spoilers, but what can we look forward to in Episode 5?\n\nI think in Episode 5 you’re gonna get some really cool stuff with Henry. I don’t think I’m really spoiling anything by saying that you can you see in Episode 3 that we’re kind of heading into his story more. It was a great thrill to do. We have a lot of good acting and good scenes that you can look forward to.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-24T21:42:28.770979"}

What’s especially hard for me with PJ’s passing is that he lived with that kind of violence. What I was spared, he endured in a different form, at an age where there is no emotional defense, and the self is still forming.

But society friends Dinah (Leslie Bibb) and Evelyn (Allison Janney) — along with Ann (Mindy Cohn), as Palm Beach’s resident reporter — quickly discovered at the morgue that the deceased is not Maxine.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMeanwhile, Perry (Jordan Bridges) delivered “Maxine’s” ashes to a devastated Douglas (Josh Lucas), as the town gathered for the funeral, completely unaware that the very much alive Maxine is hiding inside the casket. The eccentric spiritualist Mary delivered a message from the real dead woman — Maxine’s twin, Mirabelle — then lifted the casket lid and saw that Maxine was there. Chaos erupted: mourners gasp, Mitzi (Kaia Gerber) ran screaming, and an inconsolable Douglas eulogized his ex, telling the “dead” Maxine how much he loves her.\n\nLater that night, Maxine and Douglas connected, and she asked if he truly meant what he said at the church, that he loves her… but his answer isn’t exactly what she expected.\n\n“He’s untethered, he’s lost, and he’s terrified,” Josh Lucas tells Variety. “He’s in such pain. He’s just devastated… And then you think, is it because he loves her so much or is it because he’s totally a narcissist?”\n\nDouglas (Josh Lucas) and Mitzi (Kaia Geber) attend Maxine’s funeral on ‘Palm Royale.’ Erica Parise\n\nMaxine and Douglas’ love affair has changed since moving to Palm Royale. “When you have a relationship that’s that long — and even though you can dismiss it as these two are silly people — their souls are exploded,” he says. “So I don’t think Douglas is thinking about putting the pieces back together. I think he’s now truly unleashed. … His world has been his oyster, and it no longer is.”\n\nIt began with his infidelity and “each piece of it, it just keeps getting worse,” Lucas adds. “He loses Maxine, causes her to have a heart attack, and then when he finally [completely] loses her, I think he’s not a man who’s ever gonna put it back together again. He is not going to therapy.”\n\nLucas believes that up to the point he met Maxine, women were truly just “transactional” for him —and marrying Linda/Penelope (Laura Dern) was just “the next right thing to do for his life, career and money.”\n\nHe continues, “I think when he met Maxine, he truly fell in love. My sense of him is that he actually did have integrity in it, particularly in his mind that he was loyal and faithful, and he took great pride in that because he was flying all over the world. And sure, he would flirt with stewardesses, but he wouldn’t do anything.”\n\nThere is something childlike about Douglas — or dog-like, as Lucas says.\n\n“He’s a Labrador puppy, who just is having the best time destroying the house, but then realizes, ‘Oh, my God, I destroyed the house!’” he says with a grin. “Look, he comes from incredible privilege. One of the things I think is so terrific about this show is the candy-coated confection of it all — but in the center of it is kind of this bitter pill all the time of reality.”\n\nThat dichotomy was part of the character design from the beginning. “Abe Sylvia and the creators, I don’t want to say in any way are making fun of these people because they’re not. These people exist, particularly back in this time,” he says of the 1970s setting. “But there’s obviously a through line to these, particularly white men of incredible wealth and privilege who just have no real understanding of the world. They’re truly in their own bubble. And Douglas has been in it his entire life.”\n\nIn a way, Maxine and Douglas’ marriage is playing out in a very realistic 1970s scenario, when men had their roles in the family and career, and women had theirs. Pre-Palm Royale, Maxine was a traditional wife, and Douglas was just fine with that.\n\n“She talks about it — she’s a trad wife, and she takes great pride in that,” he says. “There’s honor in it. I do think that’s a very interesting thing that’s even going on in today’s time — the value or devalue of that. That’s where the show finds all these lovely through lines — Roe v Wade, women’s rights and the civil rights movement. But Douglas and Maxine are completely devoid of that.”\n\nDuring a recent Q&A, Sylvia reminded the audience that during this period of time, in certain parts of this country, a woman could not have a checking account without her husband’s signature.\n\n“Those would be things that Douglas would think would be good. And Maxine, her eyes are obviously being opened throughout the show by all these women who are showing her these layers of what’s possible in how society’s changing,” Lucas points out. “But I also think she takes great pride in being a wife who really loves and takes care of her husband. … I think we really try and stay away from pounding any sort of obvious political or psycho sociological message and just purely allow the show to exist as a confection.”\n\n“Palm Royale” Season 2 is currently streaming exclusively on Apple TV+, with new episodes arriving weekly on Wednesdays.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:13:17 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T05:34:16.347630"}

If you can’t get enough Italian gangster prequels, are dying to know where Lupin protagonist Assane Diop’s story goes next or need your fix of Disney+ bonkbuster, then you’ve come to the right place, as we walk you through 2026 in TV terms.\n\nGomorrah (Sky)\n\nSky\n\nNow here’s a prequel the world can get on board with – or on the peddle bike if we’re using the above image as a reference. Already envisaged as running for at least three seasons, Gomorrah – The Origins takes audiences back to 1977 Naples, tracking the criminal coming-of-age of the young Pietro Savastano, a “tough city kid who grew up in the poorest parts of Secondigliano.” Produced by Sky Studios and Cattleya, the show will expand the world of one of Sky’s most popular foreign dramas, inspired by Roberto Saviano’s bestselling non-fiction novel. Across five seasons and more than 50 episodes, Gomorrah was a huge hit for the pay-TV giant, putting it on the map in Italy. Sky may not make an enormous amount of original content from the nation anymore, but if The Origins can attract the kind of ratings and awards buzz of its predecessor, that will go a long way to keeping its name relevant in the original content game. The prequel stars Luca Lubrano, Francesco Pellegrino and Flavio Furno.\n\nLupin (Netflix)\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n‘Lupin’ Netflix\n\nWhen it lands in fall 2026, it will be three years since the previous instalment of Netflix’s slick French-language drama about master thief Assane Diop, played by the charismatic Omar Sy. That’s a long time to wait – and will no doubt raise the regular debate around wait times between seasons of streaming shows – but it’ll also mean anticipation reaches a crescendo and it’s bound to win over any frustrated fans. Based on the Arsène Lupin character Maurice Leblanc created in the early 1900s, the series initially followed Assane’s revenge mission against the Pellegrini family who wronged his father, before morphing into a search for his abducted son and then on to his mission to steal the Black Pearl. Viewers will know Part 3 ended with Assane finally in jail, but given his skills picking locks and disappearing from tight spaces, we can confidently say he won’t remain there for long. Ludivine Sagnier, Antoine Gouy and Soufiane Guerrab are among those returning, with the creative team of George Kay and François Uzan back, and Louis Leterrier and Sy himself the showrunners.\n\nRivals (Disney+)\n\nDisney\n\nThe buzz is building for the second season of Disney+’s Rivals to the point where the actual Queen consort of the UK visited the set earlier this month. Queen Camilla was on set to pay tribute to the late Jilly Cooper, the Rivals author who passed away earlier this year, and the cast and creative team behind the bonkbuster have been doing the same as they ready a second run of the adaptation starring David Tennant, Nafessa Williams and Aidan Turner. Following a dramatic cliffhanger ending to Season 1, audiences can expect more drama, swagger and jaw-dropping romps in the second run as Rupert Everett and Hayley Atwell join the cast and the show continues to delve deep into the cutthroat world of 1980s British TV franchise bidding (it’s way more fun than it sounds, promise). This quintessentially British period drama may have seemed a bit leftfield when Disney+ first jumped aboard, but it is now firmly established as one of the streamer’s most prominent international originals.\n\nBerlin and the Lady with an Ermine (Netflix)\n\nFelipe Hernández/Netflix\n\nThe secret sauce behind the success of Álex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato’s hit Money Heist franchise has been the ability to reinvent while retaining DNA. With that in mind, enter Berlin and the Lady with an Ermine, the second season of Money Heist spin-off Berlin that brings a name change and some new characters, but the same sense of fun that has cemented the franchise as one of the most successful non-English-language shows of all time. This time around, Berlin and Damián are bringing the gang together to pretend to steal Da Vinci’s ‘Lady with an Ermine’ portrait. But their real target is the Duke of Málaga and his wife, a couple who think they can blackmail Berlin. With his mix of deadly dark humor and a clearly tortured past, Pedro Alonso’s Berlin was always ripe for a spin-off, which has manifested in the show’s success on Netflix. The Lady with an Ermine will likely prove that Pina and Lobato continue to be one of the deadliest duos in the biz today.\n\nThe Night Manager (BBC, Prime Video)\n\nThe Ink Factory/BBC/Amazon/Des Willie\n\nTom Hiddleston’s Jonathan Pine is back after a decade. Now living as Alex Goodwin – a low-level MI6 officer running a quiet surveillance unit in London – his life is comfortingly uneventful. It won’t surprise audiences to find out that this won’t be the case for long. Starring Hiddleston, Olivia Colman, Elizabeth Debicki and Hugh Laurie, The Night Manager was one of 2016’s most popular dramas and it has been welcomed back into the fold, with a deluxe double-season order and a new co-pro partner in Prime Video. This season, which kicks off on New Year’s Day on the BBC and mid-Jan on PV, welcomes Daisy Jones & The Six star Camila Morrone, but what of Laurie’s Richard Roper? Last seen bundled into the back of a van, all eyes will be on Roper’s potential return. John le Carré adaptations have proven to be a rich well for the BBC to mine – it is also adapting The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and A Legacy of Spies starring Matthew Macfadyen with MGM+ – and this one could be a banker.\n\nHow To Get to Heaven From Belfast (Netflix)\n\nChristopher Barr/Netflix\n\nEver since Derry Girls wrapped in 2022, all eyes have been trained on where next for the stupendous comic talent of Lisa McGee. McGee’s next project may also have a Northern Irish city in the title, but the vibe has shifted, as has the commissioner, following a sign-of-the-times moment that saw Netflix swoop in and pick up the show from Channel 4 when the latter simply couldn’t afford it. How to Get to Heaven From Belfast is described by McGee as a “mash up of two different genres, mystery and comedy,” following Saoirse, Robyn and Dara as they head out on a weird and wild adventure “full of twists, turns, and arguments about eyelash extensions.” Expect some trademark McGee wit with perhaps a bit more bite and a few more weighty plot points than Derry Girls. Viewers are in for a treat.\n\n4 Blocks Zero (HBO Max)\n\n4 Blocks Zero will one of the big draws for HBO Max as it rolls out in more major European territories next year, especially in Germany, the country from where the prequel to the critically-acclaimed 4 Blocks hails. While the original series, made for Warner-owned German network TNT Serie between 2017-2019, focused on how Ali ‘Toni’ Hamadi, the leader of a Berlin-Neukölln crime family, attempted to leave the gangster’s life behind, the prequel details how the Hamadi family became the most influential Arabic underworld clan in the city. Quirin Berg and Max Wiedemann are back to exec produce, with Bernd Lange leading a writing team. No detail yet on the cast, but this is certain to be one of 2026’s biggest European drama launches. The original 4 Blocks won major domestic prizes such as the Grimme-Preis for lead actor Kida Khodr Ramadan Ramadan, co-star Veysel Gelin, and director Marvin Kren, along with six German Television Awards, including Best Drama Series. 4 Blocks Zero will have similarly lofty ambitions.\n\nEl Homenaje (SkyShowtime)\n\nThis crime family thriller, whose English-language title is The Tribute, feels like it could be described as SkyShowtime’s answer to Succession. Shot in Spain, it tells the story of Adolfo Novak (Eusebio Poncela), patriarch of one of the most powerful families in the country, who gathers his family and close friends to celebrate his 80th birthday. As the evening unfolds, a dark truth gets revealed that has the potential to destroy everything. It quietly filmed last year, with the cast and production team primarily hailing from SkyShowtime’s well-received drama series Matices (Shades). Along with Poncela, who plays the steely lead, Miriam Giovanelli, Juana Acosta, Enrique Arce, Raúl Prieto, Luis Tosar, Luisa Mayol and Elsa Pataky all return in new roles, having appeared in Matices. Secuoya Studios, which has been attaching itself to several eye-catching Spanish-language dramas, is producing alongside Stellarmedia. Prime Video is attached for second window rights – another sign that the Spanish-language project has been well received in Spain and could be set for further travel.\n\nVaka (Prime Video)\n\nDeadline first told you about this dystopian thriller out of Sweden back in March. Aliette Opheim and Jonas Karlsson star in Vaka, which follows the spread of a deadly insomnia epidemic in Stockholm through the eyes of people in very different circumstances – for example, a disgraced minister has to balance addressing the crisis and caring for his son, while an ambulance nurse goes to great lengths to save her lover and a teenage girl protects a neighbor’s son after his family succumbs. Their stories slowly intertwine and the living nightmare fuels growing panic. Skybound Entertainment, no stranger to end-of-times narratives thanks to its work on The Walking Dead, controls the rights and struck a deal with Prime Video Nordics to local rights, while shopping it elsewhere. Amazon MGM Studios, Unlimited Stories and Sagafilm, the latter of which was acquired by Skybound and 5th Planet Games last year, are also attached, with Nordic soft money also involved. In a post-pandemic world where a collective trauma has been felt worldwide, the six-part series will have a greater significance for many viewers. Prime Video now also has rights in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands, and will launch the show on January 30, 2026.\n\nHarvest (New8)\n\nDR Sales\n\nOscar-nominated writer-director Martin Zandvliet’s latest TV series is rather fantastically billed by its distributor, DR Sales, as “Succession with tractors and tradition.” The eight-episode show stars the likes of Katrine Greis-Rosenthal, Elliott Crosset Hove, Lars Brygmann, Charlotte Fich, Simon Bennebjerg and Joachim Fjelstrup in a drama set in rural Denmark, where in-fighting breaks out over the future of a family farm. When the patriarch names his youngest daughter as his successor, the family is torn apart as her brother, a resentful nephew and others vie for control. The family are further forced into the spotlight by a shocking scare involving two missing children. European commissioning club New8 is behind the show, which Danish pubcaster DR had initially ordered in 2024. International delivery is expected in Q4 2026, with a festival release expected before that, around the second quarter of next year. Maybe this is one for Canneseries? Fans of Zandvliet’s Academy Award-nominated Land of Mine will be ploughing the fields in anticipation for this one.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T11:23:05.919751"}

The PG-13 adventure is expected to secure around $20 million between Thursday and Sunday. A $45 million-budgeted meta-reboot, “Anaconda” follows best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie (you guessed it!) 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down.\n\n“Marty Supreme” was ever-so-slightly behind “Anaconda” on box office charts with $2.01 million from 2,668 venues during Wednesday’s previews.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was canceled by its host this year in protest of the addition of Donald Trump‘s name to the Washington, D.C., building.\n\nChuck Redd, a jazz drummer and vibraphonist who has hosted the annual holiday “Jazz Jams“ at the Kennedy Center since 2006 (he took over for previous host Keter Betts, a jazz bassist who died in 2005), told the Associated Press last night that he decided to drop this year’s event after Trump’s name was added to the venue by its Trump-appointed board.\n\n“When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd told The Associated Press. The concert would have included performances from seven jazz musicians.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe addition of Trump’s name to the venue appears to be in violation of a 1964 law that prohibits the addition of names or memorials to anyone other than John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in 1963. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH) filed a lawsuit on Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeking a declaration that the name of the arts institution is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and that a board vote last week to change the name is null and void.\n\n“Because Congress named the center by statute, changing the Kennedy Center’s name requires an act of Congress,” Beatty’s lawsuit stated. “But on December 18 and 19, 2025—in scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic—the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump. This is a flagrant violation of the rule of law, and it flies in the face of our constitutional order. Congress intended the Center to be a living memorial to President Kennedy—and a crown jewel of the arts for all Americans, irrespective of party. Unless and until this Court intervenes, Defendants will continue to defy Congress and thwart the law for improper ends.”\n\nAfter Trump’s name was added to the venue, Roma Daravi, spokeswoman for the center, defended the board’s authority to change the name. “This action is in line with the precedent of the State Department adding President Trump’s name to the Institute of Peace. And the previous Administration renaming military bases.” she said in a statement. (The renaming of the military bases that had Confederate names was authorized by an act of Congress in 2021.)\n\nThe jazz concert is just the latest casualty of Trump’s takeover of the venerable arts institution. Earlier this week, the American College Theatre Festival suspended its 60-year partnership with the Kennedy Center, with Festival officials saying the affiliation is “no longer viable” due to “circumstances and decisions that do not align with our organization’s values.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center has not yet commented on the jazz concert cancellation, with its official website merely confirming that the concert was canceled. The website also indicates that admission to the concert was free of charge.\n\nAmong the artists who have canceled Kennedy Center appearances post-Trump takeover are Issa Rae, Peter Wolf and a planned production of Hamilton, among others.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 16:52:53 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T16:58:33.975186"}

Safdie and his crew faithfully recreated the world of 1950s ping pong players in New York, Tokyo and beyond, then populated that milieu with a cast of memorable supporting characters from movie star Kay Stone, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, to her ruthless businessman husband, played by Mr. Wonderful himself, Kevin O’Leary.\n\nThe details of the parlors and matches are so carefully rendered that it’s no surprise that Safdie is very familiar with that world. In fact, his 2008 film “The Pleasure of Being Robbed” features a sequence set in a Chinatown table tennis parlor.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“The people who excelled at table tennis were often people who didn’t fit anywhere else,” says Safdie in the film’s press materials. “It wasn’t respected, so naturally it attracted weirdos, purists, obsessives.”\n\nIn addition to doing extensive historical research, the crew consulted experts, including Steve Grant, publisher of Table Tennis History magazine, who spoke to Variety about the inspiration for the film.\n\nWas Marty Mauser based on a real person?\n\nMarty Mauser, played by Chalamet, is based on a real table tennis champion of the 1950s, Marty Reisman, who died in 2012. Sports Illustrated called him “the game’s most celebrated hustler.” While the film is only loosely inspired by his story, the character definitely shares similarities with Reisman, Grant explains.\n\n“He was very good at marketing himself,” Grant says, “That was his biggest skill. Of course, he was a very good player.” But like Marty Mauser, who plays pretty loose with the truth, Reisman likely inflated his stories, Grant says. Reisman’s book, “The Money Player,” is a “great book about his career back in the ’50s,” Grant explains. “But don’t take everything in it as the word of truth. He liked to exaggerate things.”\n\nWhen Safdie came across an old copy of “The Money Player,” he sparked to the idea of a story based on Reisman. “When I read that the sport was filling stadiums in the U.K. and throughout Europe, I realized that it was entirely plausible for a kid in 1952 to actually believe he could parlay the game into a life of fame and glory,” Safdie said in the press materials.\n\nHow many of Marty Supreme’s stunts were real?\n\nWhile many of Marty Mauser’s antics stretch credulity, the real Reisman, nicknamed “the needle” for his slight build and fast swing, was known for his showmanship and hustle. He could split a cigarette in half with a ping pong ball from across the net and would play blindfolded or sitting down if the stakes were high enough. As shown in the film, he and a partner did tour the world with the Harlem Globetrotters with a comedy ping pong routine in which they hit balls with frying pans and sneakers.\n\nVariety’s announcement of “The Money Player” option\n\nThe real Reisman pulled off enough wild escapades to fill a whole other movie, according to an extensive Sports Illustrated profile — as he traveled the world, he was smuggling and selling goods, from nylon stockings to fine crystal, and challenging heads of state to high-stakes games. He really did fly on a military transport, as shown in the film, and did briefly work in a shoe store. Reisman told the magazine his book had sold to the movies, and he proposed that Robert De Niro could play him. But although it was optioned after publication, according to a 1974 Variety article, the project never got off the ground.\n\nDid Reisman really lose the World Championship to a Japanese player?\n\nReisman traveled to India, not Japan as in the movie, to compete against Hiroji Satoh. As depicted in the film, he took a hard loss to Satoh, who was using a new sponge rubber-coated type of paddle. But the loss came in round 64, not the final. “The truth was he would have had to win five more matches in 1952 to win the title, and he was not the top favorite,” Grant explains.\n\nWere there other Jewish table tennis champions?\n\n“Fellow Jewish New Yorker Dick Miles won many championships in the 1940s and ’50s, well before Reisman won much of anything,” Grant explains. In fact, Jewish Europeans, especially Hungarians, dominated table tennis in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1950s, Asian and particularly Japanese players began to gain prominence in the sport.\n\nWere any other characters based on real people?\n\nWhile many of the film’s characters feel deeply authentic, most are fictional, with the exception of Koto Endo, played by real-life champion Koto Kawaguchi and based on Reisman’s competitor Satoh. There’s also basketball star George “The Ice Man” Gervin, who plays a character based on Herwald Lawrence, who owned a ping pong parlor that was the first Black-owned business in Times Square.\n\nPlaywright David Mamet has a cameo in the film and he has a historic ping pong connection. Mamet, who was a table tennis hustler himself in his college days, used to frequent Reisman’s table tennis gym on the Upper West Side, along with other notables including Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 17:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T17:27:37.515320"}

I honestly have no idea what’s going on over there.\n\nI do know what’s going on over here though, and I can tell you that, from a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year. Tyranny is booming over here.\n\nYou may have read in your colourful newspapers my country’s President would like to shut me up because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored. The American government made a threat against me and the company I work for, and all of a sudden we were off the air. But then, you know what happened? A Christmas miracle happened. Well, it was September, it was a September miracle. But the holiday does seem to come earlier and earlier every year, doesn’t it?\n\nMillions and millions of people stood up and said: ‘No, this is not acceptable’. People who never watched my show, people who were on record saying they hate my show spoke out, they marched, they did this all to support the right to a free expression of speech and because so many people spoke out, we came back. Our show came back stronger than ever. We won, the President lost and now I’m back on the air every night givin’ the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking. That’s a word, right, I used it properly?\n\nAnd the reason I’m telling you this story is because maybe you’re thinking: ‘Oh a government silencing its critics is something that happens in places like Russia, or North Korea, or LA, not the UK’. Well, that’s what we thought and now we’ve got King Donny the Eighth calling for executions. It happens fast.\n\nYou know it’s funny we Americans are very proud of not having a king. It’s kind of why we left. Earlier this year tens of millions of us marched at protests called No Kings. You had some of those there. And just for the record we have nothing against your king. I mean I don’t know if you know this, but his son lives here. We just – well some of us – just have a problem with the guy who thinks he is our king.\n\nHere in the United States right now we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy. From the free press, to science, to medicine, to judicial independence, to the actual White House itself, we are a right mess. And we know this is also affecting you, and I just wanted to say sorry. And we want you to know or, at least I want you to know, that we’re not all like him. We’re not all like that.\n\nLook I know (from the musical Hamilton) that our countries didn’t start off on the greatest note, but I also know (from seeing Love Actually) that we have a special relationship. So, if I might speak on behalf of my country – which I most certainly do not – our message to you, our friends across the pond this Christmas is: don’t give up on us.

From now on, I’ll have to use the past tense, and that fills me with such profound sadness. But there’s no other choice.”\n\nThe Reiners, aged 78 and 70, were found dead in their Brentwood home on Dec. 14 with knife wounds. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder.\n\nScorsese first got to know Rob Reiner shortly after moving to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, when he started going to get-togethers hosted by George Memmoli and filled with comedians and actors.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Rob and I were both Eastern transplants, in a way,” Scorsese wrote. Reiner came from show business royalty, his parents being the performers Carl and Estelle Reiner. “This was 100 percent New York humor, and it was in the air I breathed.”\n\n“Right away, I loved hanging out with Rob. We had a natural affinity for each other. He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room,” Scorsese wrote. “He had a beautiful sense of uninhibited freedom, fully enjoying the life of the moment, and he had a great barreling laugh. When they honored him at Lincoln Center, Michael McKean did a bit, which was a brilliant parody of solemn official tribute speeches. Before he got to the punchline, Rob laughed so hard you could hear it throughout the auditorium.”\n\nScorsese’s favorite film directed by Reiner is “Misery,” which he described as “a very special film, beautifully acted by Kathy Bates and James Caan.” And he wrote that “This Is Spinal Tap” is “in a class of its own … an immaculate creation.” When Scorsese was casting his 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street,” he “immediately thought of Rob” to play the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort.\n\n“He could improvise with the best, he was a master at comedy, he worked beautifully with Leo and the rest of the guys, and he understood the human predicament of his character: The man loved his son, he was happy with his success, but he knew that he was destined for a fall,” Scorsese wrote of Reiner. “There’s that wonderful moment where Rob watches as Jon Favreau explains to Leo that he can get out relatively unscathed if he just walks away from his company before the S.E.C. has a chance to charge him with violations. The look on Rob’s face, as he realizes that Leo is hesitating and that he ultimately won’t stop, is so eloquent. ‘You got all the money in the world,’ he says. ‘You need everybody else’s money?’ A loving father, mystified by his son.”\n\nScorsese added, “I was moved by the delicacy and openness of his performance when we shot it, moved once again as we brought the scene together in the edit and moved as I watched the finished picture. Now, it breaks my heart to even think of the tenderness of Rob’s performance in this and other scenes.”\n\nThe filmmaker concluded his essay: “What happened to Rob and Michele is an obscenity, an abyss in lived reality. The only thing that will help me to accept it is the passing of time. So, like all of their loved ones and their friends — and these were people with many, many friends — I have to be allowed to imagine them alive and well … and that one day, I’ll be at a dinner or a party and find myself seated next to Rob, and I’ll hear his laugh and see his beatific face and laugh at his stories and relish his natural comic timing, and feel lucky all over again to have him as a friend.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 18:02:33 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T18:40:46.433418"}

It was one of those strange pitches where we’re going, ‘No, no, you guys can’t do this. You can’t.’ And they’re like, ‘We want to do this with you.’”\n\nPremiering on Christmas, this “Anaconda,” also directed by Gormican, is not a reboot, remake or even a continuation of the original. While the ’90s reptilian horror provides a solid springboard for the film, the new “Anaconda” is something different entirely, centering not on a National Geographic crew but rather a group of life-long, middle-aged friends who head to the Amazon to shoot their own version of the original film. Stars Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Steve Zahn and Thandiwe Newton soon find themselves fighting for survival against the world’s largest snake (which is even larger this time around, thanks to CGI). And while it definitely has nods to its predecessor, it was important to Gormican to toe the line carefully.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“These are two stories about taking a boat up the river, right?” said Gormican. “A snake basically slithers on land or in the water.

[But] I didn’t want to play in that sandbox.”\n\nInstead, they upped the comedic ante, creating what Gormican describes as a “buddy movie that becomes an adventure film that becomes an action film that becomes a horror film.” (He cites “City Slickers” and “American Movie” as points of inspiration). “Audiences are just tired of not seeing original stories,” he explained. “It’s been a decade of, ‘Here’s some remakes of stuff that you used to love,’ and there’s a limit to people’s nostalgia.”\n\nThis “Anaconda” is also full of meta elements that poke fun of Hollywood itself. Famously charismatic Rudd plays a struggling actor in Los Angeles, and the rag-tag group runs into a “real” Sony crew filming a reboot of “Anaconda” who joke about Hollywood having “no new ideas.” The characters also stumble upon original “Anaconda” star Ice Cube, who is on the studio’s snake-destroyed set to reprise his role. When they ask how the writers planned to kill the reptile in their movie, he responds they never finished the script.\n\n“It was mirroring exactly what was happening,” said Gormican, who lost two final locations while filming in Australia — the first being a factory that then went on strike, and the second being a boatyard the crew had created, only for it to get destroyed by a cyclone. Parts of the latter set actually made it into the movie as they pivoted to end the film using what was left of it: “We went in and made it look [purposefully] destroyed,” explained Gormican. “And we just said it was a snake.”\n\nAnd while “Anaconda” doesn’t get too sentimental over its source material, it does capitalize on a few familiar faces. In addition to Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez also has a cameo in the film, where the two actors play themselves. “We were always thinking that it would be fun to have the surviving members,” said Gormican, especially once they decided the friends would run into the filming of the reboot. “So we just kept reaching out.” Ultimately, both joined in, giving the film their “stamp of approval.” And, yes, they considered bringing back other “Anaconda” actors, though it ended up not making sense to: “If they died in the original, would they be back at the remake if their character was dead?”\n\nAbove all else, with this new “Anaconda,” Gormican was dedicated to creating a film that felt like fun.\n\n“The thing that I’ve been missing in my cinema-going experience is a movie for everyone, that plays in a massively fun, adventurous way,” said Gormican. “People lament the loss of the communal feeling of being at a comedy together. And I hope that people get a chance to experience that in this film, and maybe ignite something in a younger generation where they go, ‘Oh, shit. That’s actually something we love to do.’”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-25T23:44:48.207219"}

It can be difficult, first, to overcome the expectation that they’re either cash grabs or sops to sentimentality, and secondly, to come up with an original take on seasonal music, even with the best intentions. Should an artist deign to embark on a full-on Christmas music tour, suspicions might be even more aroused. What, other than opportunism, could be the reason for that much devotion to the season?\n\nSo God bless the occasional singer-songwriter like Ben Folds who sees Christmas as a way into writing the kinds of songs he would usually write, not just for the purposes of a new album but a proper concert outing. His recently wrapped Tis the Season tour was a veritable Christmas Star in shining a light on the right path to undertake doing this kind of thing, as was the album of mostly original material that precipitated it, 2024’s archly titled “Sleigher.” Folds brings to the concert state a satisfyingly holistic approach to holiday music, give or take a couple of “ho’s.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nEven before Folds recorded “Sleigher,” there was a body of solid evidence that he was the right man for the task. That was the fact that he’d already written and recorded a number of songs that mention Christmas or the holidays either prominently or incidentally — prior tunes that, combined with the “Sleigher” material, easily added up to a full set, before getting to any non-seasonal numbers thrown in as bonus tracks for the encore. Most notable of these, as any fan would know, is his late ’90s hit “Brick,” a ballad about taking one’s girlfriend to get an abortion on Dec. 26. Once you’ve written that as your first “Christmas song,” you’ve established a fine outer parameter for how far you’re willing to stretch the genre, such as it is.\n\nAt one of two sold-out appearances at L.A.’s new Blue Note Cafe, where he was among the few non-jazz artists booked thus far in the young life of that club, Folds and his combo naturally performed “Brick,” along with a few other pre-existing holiday songs that tended toward that outer edge, like the novelty songs “Bizarre Christmas Incident” and the indelicately titled “Bitch Went Nutz.” But being subversive about Christmas is not actually really his thing, or his current thing, anyway. And the “Sleigher” album, despite its irreverent name, tends more toward the center, with earnest songs that aren’t afraid to at least skim sentiment, if not indulge in it, even if the sentiment is loneliness. In the overall course of the set, Folds was able to play Christmas for comedy, but more often than not came up for something more earnest, all the way to covering Mel Torme and Vince Guaraldi without apology.\n\nRight at the outset, he explained why he came to see the season as a meaningful setting for original songs.\n\n“I like a good rhyme, and that’s why I guess I’ve bothered to write a whole Christmas album, plus a few other songs in my past,” he told the Blue Note audience. “There were Christmas songs and a whole slew of songs that mention it” in his catalog, “and I think the reason is because it is so all-pervasive once a year. It is such a bully of a holiday — it takes over everything. It’s the holiday that’s too big to fail. And it’s the same shit every year. It’s the same colors, the same sights, sounds, songs, everything… same ads… And that’s the gift.”\n\nHe would have to further explain that, and did.\n\n“Because when everything is the same and it just feels like a continuation of yesterday, which was 2024, and the day before that was Christmas 2023, the only thing that’s changed is you. And I think that’s the reason I’ve been interested in the topic. You could be at at dinner at Christmas and realize that only two days in Christmas time ago, there were a couple people that used to be here that are not here anymore. And then you’re sitting and talking to nephews who weren’t even here what seems like a couple days ago, and now they’re bald and telling you about their bankruptcy. It’s crazy. So, by having that as a marker, it makes it a rhyme. That’s what a rhyme is for. It is at the end of a phrase or a couplet to sound the same. Everything seems like it ought to be same, but it’s a little bit different; you actually learned something in the last 10 syllables.”\n\nBen Folds at the Blue Note Major Caldwell IV\n\nWith that, he went into “Christmas Time Rhyme,” which, as he explained, was originally supposed to be the title track of his holiday album last year, before “I thought of ‘Sleigher’ and I thought, ‘Man, I gotta use that. That’s better.'” It’s a lovely song tracing those noble thoughts about cyclical thoughts and time speeding up and slowing down and putting us back down where we were, the same and different. And it also puts that poetry aside to cut to the chase: “Precious moments like these, they mean the world to me\n\n/ Listen, you’re all fuckin’ freaks, but we’re family / So we do what it takes to be in one place, if just for a day.”\n\nAlong with the more familiar cover chestnuts that also peppered his set, Folds introduced his audience to “You Don’t Have to Be a Santa Claus (When Christmas Comes Around),” a fairly obscure oldie dating back at least to 1955, when the Mills Brothers recorded it. (Folds said it was written during the Great Depression.) “I thought it might be relevant these days because it’s about how you might think about helping someone out on other days besides Christmas, and that at the time was a controversial statement, like it is now, to help someone else out.”\n\nCloser to home, he got at what it’s like to be truly solitary at Christmas — or at least other than the companionship of a pet — with his original “Maurice,” written in Nashville in “one of those really everything-looks-the-same sort of suburban neighborhoods that’s not that inspiring. And all the neighbors had the same exact Christmas decorations in their front yard — an inflatable Santa that’s about two stories high and an inflatable reindeer next door; every House down the street almost had the same thing in the front of the yard. Maurice fucking hated the reindeer. He said so many inappropriate things to them in their reindeer language… Our yard was right next to I-40, which comes out here too. And Maurice would dig holes in the snow, and I sort of imagined he was trying to dig a path out.”\n\nThe funnier songs of the past had their own stories. “Bitch Went Nutz” was about a young, conservative lawyer on the rise inviting a liberal barista to be his date at the office Christmas party, only to have her wind up in a screaming political argument with his right-wing colleagues. “Bizarre Christmas Incident” was written as his first misguided attempt at an end-titles theme for “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”; he regaled the Blue Note audience with the tale of how horror-stricken the music supervisor was when he turned it in: “Ben Folds, it’s a fucking kids movie. I’m not showing this to Ron Howard!” He then followed that in concert with the much more appropriate song he turned around in the next 24 hours that successfully made it into the movie, “Lonely Christmas Eve.”\n\nMost plaintive was a song he co-wrote with Nick Hornby, “Picture Window,” about the celebrated novelist and his wife spending New Year’s Eve with their chronically ill son in a London hospital room. The refrain: “You know what hope is? / Hope is a bastard, hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease / Hope comes near you / Kick its backside / Got no place in days like these.” The holiday season doesn’t get any more sobering than that, notwithstanding the Blue Note’s drink minimum.\n\nWhat do you do after that full spectrum of holiday fare than sing “The Christmas Song”? Along with, come the encore, unseasonal chestnuts from his own catalog, like “Philosophy,” from his more keyboard-pounding Ben Folds Era, before circling back to Charlie Brown with “Christmas Time Is Here,” sung by duet partner Lindsey Craft, to send the audience out into the non-chill on a note of buzzed tranquility.\n\nFolds remains one of our most reliable songwriters, so it’s not surprising that his Christmas material would be as solid as the rest — and that he, unlike most of his contemporaries, would recognize that the mass audience’s hunger for seasonal songs is something worth sating. Because, if nothing else, it does represent a twelfth of our lives, give or take. He has a song called “Sleepwalking Through Christmas,” but it’s to his credit he doesn’t sleepwalk through the task of coming up with this stuff. Here’s hoping for “Sleigher 2” and a perennial touring season.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:43:23 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T02:20:43.588076"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.\n\nAfter nearly a decade, Stranger Things fans finally have some answers about the Upside Down and the supernatural forces that have been plaguing Hawkins since Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) disappeared on November 6, 1983.\n\nThe second volume of the series’ final season unveils most of the secrets that creators Matt and Ross Duffer have been keeping from just about everyone since Season 1, including the fact that the Upside Down has actually been a wormhole to another dimension this entire time.\n\n“We’ve known it was a wormhole since Season 1, but it’s one thing to say it, and it’s another to try to figure out how to visualize such an abstract concept,” Ross told Deadline.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe Wormhole\n\nIn the first two of three episodes, Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), Steve (Joe Keery) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) are searching for clues about what could be behind the massive, flesh-like wall they’ve discovered surrounding the Upside Down-version of their town. They find answers inside Hawkins Lab, but not the ones they were expecting.\n\nAt the end of Episode 5, “Shock Jock,” Dustin discovers one of Dr. Brenner’s (Matthew Modine) journals at the same time that Nancy and Jonathan make it to the roof of the lab to find a mysterious presence floating above it. Dustin realizes far too late that neither Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) nor Holly (Nell Fisher) — nor anyone for that matter — are behind the wall, because the wall is actually holding the whole place together. Before he can warn Nancy and Jonathan, the older Wheeler aims her shotgun at the mass on the roof and sends a sweeping shockwave through the Upside Down, ripping a gash in the wall of the wormhole. It’s at that moment that viewers finally get a glimpse of what it looks like from afar.\n\nL to R: Joe Keery as Steve Harrington and Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson in ‘Stranger Things’ 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\n“I think, ultimately, we really wanted it to have that hourglass shape, because we thought that was the simplest way to communicate such a big idea to the audience,” Ross explained. “But to do that, we had to zoom out. I can’t remember how many miles away visual effects figured out that we were by the end in order to see the full shape, but we had to go way out.”\n\n“We’re very far [away],” Matt laughed.\n\nContinued Ross: “Generally, we try to stay within the characters’ perspectives, but that was an instance where we thought to illustrate this best to the audience, we had to leave the characters’ perspectives for a moment, just to show the enormity of this whole thing.”\n\nIt’s thanks to Dustin that viewers, and the rest of the crew in Hawkins, won’t get lost in the theoretical physics of it all. After they make it out of the Upside Down, Dustin draws a diagram on the DJ booth at WSQK to illustrate what they’re up against. He explains that the mass that Nancy shot was exotic matter, and it’s the only thing keeping the wormhole intact.\n\n‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\n“[The Duffers] literally drew that diagram at the season pitch out two years ago, because they understood, even then, that we would need visual aids,” Shawn Levy, who directed Episodes 6 and 7 with the brothers, said. “I’m so grateful that they had Dustin draw that exact same diagram in the show that the Duffers had used to explain the show years before we shot Season 5.”\n\nThe creators don’t credit themselves with devising that explanation though, nor with the flashlight and slinky that Steve uses to help the group understand how they might use the radio tower to get to the alternate dimension that Dustin has named “The Abyss.”\n\n“One of our writers, Paul Dictor, his superpower is the harder sci-fi aspects of the show. He’s read every hard sci-fi book that there is,” Matt said. “As far as [when] it comes to this stuff, he’s smarter than Ross and I are, so he’s playing these things, and Ross and I are basically the Steve in the room going, ‘Huh?’ Illustrations help a lot. So we take a lot of those conversations that we have in the room and the way we help everybody understand it and map it onto the show.”\n\nThe Exotic Matter\n\nSpeaking of the exotic matter, as Nancy and Jonathan make their way toward the roof, they realize the entire building seems to be melting. Funnily enough, the melting lab was born not from any attachment to accuracy of an encounter with the theoretical sciences, but from a desire to put the characters in a life-threatening situation that may force them to have a conversation that they’d long been avoiding.\n\n“All we knew was that we wanted the lab to be melting, and weirdly, actually, that idea came less because we thought it was cool, and more from it kind of all revolved around, or started with, that scene between Nancy and Jonathan. We knew we wanted to put them in a life-or-death situation,” Matt explained.\n\nAfter Nancy shoots the exotic matter, the writhing ball of energy becomes even more ferocious, melting the top of the lab at a more rapid rate. She and Jonathan find themselves trapped inside a room as the roof melts around them, threatening to swallow them whole. It’s at that moment that Jonathan decides to come clean about the engagement ring he’s been carrying around this whole time.\n\nExcept, he doesn’t propose. Instead, he admits that he thinks maybe they aren’t meant to be after all, and he believes Nancy knows that deep down as well.\n\n“One of the references was Almost Famous, just like a way less comedic moment than Almost Famous when they’re on the plane and they’re about to crash, and they all confess to this, because why not? You’re about to die. So we liked that moment. Titanic was a slight reference — they both now are able to fit on the table,” Matt revealed. “So we started from there and reverse engineered what would be a situation that would present that kind of moment for them, and we came up with a melting lab.”\n\nThen comes the work of actually making the lab look like it’s melting, which required intense collaboration between the visual effects department, production designer Chris Trujillo, and art director Sean Brennan.\n\n“It stressed everybody out,” Matt laughs. “Nobody liked the melting lab idea, not because [of] the concept, but no one actually wanted to do it.”\n\nThe final scene does include some computer-generated visual effects, although the Duffers lament “it was intended to be no visual effects.”\n\nThe production had developed a special “goo-like substance” to funnel into that room so that the scene was entirely practical. Unfortunately, when it came time to produce it at such a large scale, things did not pan out as intended, requiring some post-production magic.\n\nSTRANGER THINGS: SEASON 5.

Courtesy of Netflix /Netflix © 2025\n\n“I think they tested it in too small of a batch, because by the time we had — I don’t know how many gallons of it that were needed to flood that room — it was much too thin. I mean, it wasn’t thick at all,” Matt recalled. “It was basically gray water, which was a big problem. So Nat and Charlie just acted it out [and] moved more slowly through it, and then we had ILM, who did a lot of visual effects on the final season, [adjust it]. I don’t know how they did it. They developed some sort of formula to fix it and make everything look thick. Obviously, they did all this incredible liquid simulation, at the end of the day. So it’s a real mix between practical and visual effects. It’s not, maybe, the showiest of our visual effects this season [but it] was one of the ones that blew us away.”\n\nThe Abyss…and Its Connection to Eleven\n\nThe wormhole, Dustin says, connects Hawkins to another dimension that he calls “The Abyss.” This is where be believes all of the monsters — the demogorgons, the Mind Flayer, Vecna — have all been coming from. It’s also why they haven’t been able to find Vecna in any of their crawls over the last two years. He’s not in the Upside Down at all. He’s actually thousands of yards above them, recovering in this alternate dimension, and that is where he’s keeping all those kids, including Holly. Those who have seen The First Shadow may draw connections to one Dimension X.\n\nL-R: Linnea Berthelsen as Kali, Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven, and David Harbour as Jim Hopper in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nVolume 2 does give a glimpse at this other dimension, when Holly briefly escapes Vecna’s clutches and tries to make a run for it. Outside of his lair, the world looks barren and deserted, save for a few glowing red rifts in the ground where the world is connected to the Upside Down.\n\nIt’s certainly satisfying to get the answers about the Upside Down that have evaded audiences for so long, but, in some ways, all of these explanations come with a new set of questions. What is this alternate dimension? Why is Vecna so hellbent on merging it with the human world? Is this where Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) sent him all those years ago?\n\nThe show has been alluding to the fact that the U.S. government’s been locked in some sort of arms race with Russia to access this alternate dimension, likely to use whatever lurks there as weapons of mass destruction. The Vol. 2 episodes also reveal that the government has once again started experimenting on babies in utero to create more supernatural humans like Eleven and Kali, using the latter’s blood. It hasn’t been working, though, which is why they’ve been after Eleven this whole time. They believe that her blood holds the key to creating more kids like her.\n\nL to R: David Harbour as Jim Hopper and Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhile the pieces are starting to fall into place, there are a couple of dots left to connect on this front, which the Duffers promise will happen in the two-hour finale.\n\n“The goal is to tie up the remaining loose ends and answer any questions that remain,” Ross teases. “There are a few specifically big ones…Henry and his backstory, and then Eleven and what all this means for her and Kali.”\n\nThe Stranger Things finale arrives on December 31.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 02:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T02:20:44.276574"}

Volume 2 of the final season gets into the real nitty gritty of what the Upside Down actually is and sets the stage for the final battle with Will (Noah Schnapp), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) etc. vs. Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower).\n\nEven more so than with Volume 1, Stranger Things: The First Shadow heavily connects to Episodes 505, 506 and 507. As Vecna’s whereabouts come into focus, Max (Sadie Sink) and Holly (Nell Fisher) happen upon some traumatic memories in his mindscape and he unveils his grand plan with the 12 children he has kidnapped.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThose needing a refresher of what lore has been established in previous seasons need look no further, because like we did with Volume 1, we will explain the connections building up to these three stacked episodes.\n\nEpisode 5 – “Shock Jock”\n\nL-R: Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair and Priah Ferguson as Erica Sinclair in ‘Stranger Things’ Courtesy of Netflix\n\nAs viewers learned in the epic cliffhanger ending of Episode 504, aptly titled “Sorcerer,” Will has powers, and as Mike explains them through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons, there difference between his abilities and those of Eleven or Vecna. Will being a sorcerer means that his powers are innate, drawn from a higher being (in this case, Vecna himself). He doesn’t have to study or practice much in order to access his abilities, as evidenced by the relative ease with which he tapped into the hive mind. According to D&D, a wizard has to intensely study to gather intelligence and use their powers. Wizards are reliant on preparation, whereas sorcerers can summon their talent at will.\n\nParticles & The Hive Mind\n\nThis connection comes into play when Joyce (Winona Ryder) suggests her son attempt to jack back into the Hive Mind and use Vecna’s powers against him. In order to do this, the Sinclair siblings come up with two different plans, and Lucas provides a good explanation for the way the hive mind is all connected. While popping some popcorn, he posits that the dormant particles within all hive mind participants can be energized or galvanized to make the connection more apparent. As has been key since Season 2, or really Season 1 when you think about it, particles seemingly from the Upside Down have connected Will, demogorgons, The Mind Flayer and more for better or worse. In Season 2 at the end of Episode 4, “Will the Wise,” the Mind Flayer infests Will with its shadowy essence, making him “The Spy.”\n\nLucas theorizes that these particles were also in Max’s step brother Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery), when the Mind Flayer possessed him in Season 3, which is why, when the kids trapped him in the pool sauna and cranked up the heat, it exposed inky black veins all over Billy’s body. Similar veins appeared on young Will’s neck in Season 2 when Joyce, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy (Natalie Dyer) did something similar to Will, exposing his body to intense heat to expel the Mind Flayer from his body.\n\nThe veins appear on the dead Demogorgon’s body when Robin (Maya Hawke), Will, Mike, Lucas and co. shock the body to provide a way for Will to invade Vecna’s mind. As of Volume 1’s release, the gross fleshy tube that attaches to Will and the 12 children’s mouths apparently particalizes them with Mind Flayer molecules.\n\nVecna’s Plan\n\nMeanwhile, in his eerily tranquil mindscape, Henry, posing as Mr. Whatsit, tries to persuade the 12 children he has taken that Max is a monster waiting in the woods. According to Henry, she is under control of the Black Thing, like from A Wrinkle in Time (The IT). He wants them to believe she is doing its bidding and would try to enslave the children, too. Sounds like he is really projecting himself and his intentions onto Max. He tells them, though, that his goal is to bring them “back to the light.”\n\nIn Season 4, we learned that Eleven sent Henry back to Dimension X, which is the desert-like expanse in which he found The Mind Flayer and demogorgons. He had initially been transported their by powerful technology he stumbled on when he was younger, returning with unexplained abilities. This is where The First Shadow comes into play, because that story fleshes out Henry’s childhood and the moments in Rachel, Nevada, when he stumbled upon the technology — we’ll get to this later because the memory itself appears in Episode 6.\n\nDr. Kay’s Motives\n\nLinda Hamilton as Dr. Kay in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5.\n\nBack with Eleven, Kali (Linnea Berthelssen) and Hopper (David Harbour), viewers learn what Kali knew about Henry — everything except that he was still alive. Those who didn’t skip Episode 8, “The Lost Sister,” in Season 2 will remember that Kali’s powers manifest differently than Eleven’s and Henry’s in that she can cast illusions and make the mind see things that aren’t there. She does this while she and El and Hopper get away from the military base in the Upside Down, casting a mirage of herself still connected to that horrific machine she was immobilized in.\n\nKali reveals that she previously tried to escape her confines, and in doing so, she discovered a series of pregnant woman being infused with her blood. She could tell that it was not having its desired effect, though, because the women were sick and dying and asking Kali for help. She realizes Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) was replicating Dr. Brenner’s experiments with blood transfusions in an attempt to create children with super powers. She even cast a vision for Eleven showing Henry hooked up to a pregnant woman, which was “Papa’s program” and how he created children like Kali and Eleven (008 and 011), giving them powers through Henry’s blood. She hints that since her blood wasn’t working, Kay is after Eleven for her blood because she could be more like Henry.\n\nDustin Connects the Dots\n\nDustin, Jonathan, Nancy and Steve (Joe Keery) have taken it upon themselves to investigate the Hawkins Lab in the Upside Down after Dustin determined that to be the center of the flesh-like wall encompassing the town. In the lab, he finds a map exactly like the one he drew to determine the central point, raising some red flags about the origins of the Upside Down.\n\nHe tries to tell Jonathan and Nancy not to disturb what he thought could be a shield generator, similar to the Death Star in Return of the Jedi (1983), but it wasn’t what he thought it was.\n\nWe learn throughout these episodes that the characters have been all wrong about what the Upside Down is and what’s been happening to them since Will disappeared on November 6, 1983. But, some of the most important lore to remember here is actually about Dr. Brenner’s experiments.\n\nSee our Vol. 1 mythological explainer if you need a refresher on Season 4 Episode 7, “The Massacre at Hawkins Lab,” which continues to heavily come into play in Volume 2.\n\nEpisode 6 – “Escape from Camazotz”\n\nL-R: Sadie Sink as Max Mayfield and Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe Duffer brothers teased 506 as an emotional episode, and boy does it deliver while also dispensing truth nuggets that change the perspective of the Stranger Things universe.\n\nDustin Explains The Upside Down\n\nGaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5\n\nAfter he and Steve physically brawl, putting their relationship on the brink of collapse, the pair reunite to try and get to Jonathan and Nancy’s aid after Nancy shoots a suspicious force-field atop the roof of the Hawkins Lab in the Upside Down.\n\nTurns out, The Upside Down is a wormhole that bridges Hawkins and Dimension X, where Henry’s powers originated. After going through Dr. Brenner’s mysterious journal that describes the angry red ball as exotic matter holding the wormhole together, Dustin reveals that everything they’ve thought about the alternate world is wrong and not due to dark magic, but science.\n\nDustin further diagrams all of this for the entire team in Episode 7.\n\nVecna Makes Will Spy One Last Time\n\nIn “Shock Jock,” Will hacks into Vecna and is able to stall him so that Max and Holly can escape after he threatens to kill Max and trap Holly once again. The invasion gives them enough time to escape, but once Vecna regains control, he uses his connection with Will to find Max’s body in the real world and send the demodogs after her.\n\nRemember, Will has been “spying” for Vecna, and for the Mind Flayer, since Season 2. We broke that down in our Volume 1 refresher.\n\nMax, meanwhile, is now out in the desert beyond the caves where she sheltered with Holly. She doesn’t know that it’s Will who has overtaken Vecna, assuming it’s Eleven, since she’s previously witnessed El’s ability to “piggyback” into other people’s minds. Since she and Holly aren’t privy to what’s going on back home, they have no idea that Will has these newfound powers.\n\nMax & Holly Stumble Upon Henry’s Traumatic Memory\n\nOut in the desert, where Holly draws the connection that the shape of the caves mimics the aperture in the spyglass, an M of sorts, she and Max literally almost fall down a mineshaft. M marks the spot for the reason Henry won’t venture into the caves — they witness his memory of stumbling upon the scientist who had defected from a government experiment. This is where Stranger Things: The First Shadow comes into play.\n\nWhen Henry finds the scientist, he’s clutching a briefcase that contains stolen technology from an experiment that accidentally sent a group of men to a place they’ve called Dimension X. We know that Dr. Brenner’s dad was part of this experiment, and it’s basically the entire reason that Brenner has been experimenting on kids — to try to recreate that happy accident and get back to Dimension X.\n\nThe scientist is very paranoid while Henry, dressed in his boy scout uniform, only wants to help the poor man. After the man shoots Henry in the hand, Henry bashes his skull in out of fear for his life. The young boy opens the briefcase that the scientist attempted to guard with his life. Unfortunately, the camera pans away once he opens the briefcase, and we don’t get to see what happens next, but those that know Henry’s backstory can make some educated guesses.\n\nIn Stranger Things: The First Shadow, we learn Dr. Brenner was able to track Henry down because he left his spyglass in those caves. That’s how Brenner got Henry in his clutches, realizing that Henry had gone to Dimension X and returned with a unique blood type, a different personality and new powers. Season 4 reveals that Henry was 001, the first child that led to the MKUltra experiments where Brenner created more children with supernatural powers.\n\nPresumably, all the answers about what happened to Henry in those caves are ahead in the upcoming finale.\n\nAn Emotional Escape\n\nWhen Max and Holly make it into the red hellscape in Vecna’s mind, Max quickly realizes that she and Holly can’t escape together because their bodies are in different places. She gives Holly a rousing pep talk where Holly embraces her little figurine — Holly the Heroic — that Mike gave her. This helps her move past the fear that froze her when the Demogorgon attacked her mom and when Vecna almost killed Max to believe in herself and her power.\n\nMind you, this is happening as demodogs close in on Max, Robin, Vickie (Amybeth McNulty) and an unconscious Max’s body as they hide in a laundry room below Hawkins Memorial Hospital in a scene quite reminiscent of the velociraptors closing in on Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello) in Jurassic Park (1993). Lucas doesn’t want to turn off the radio playing Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” because he believes it’s the only thing guiding Max back to him, but the sound tips off the demodogs as to where they are hiding. The song saved Max in Season 4, Episode 4, “Dear Billy” and she had previously hinted that she could have escaped Vecna’s mindscape earlier if the tape recording hadn’t needed to rewind. But, as we learn in the final moments of Episode 6, it was never about the song, specifically, but the way it provided her an enduring connection to everything that she loved, which is what really gave her the ability to escape.\n\nEpisode 7 – “The Bridge”\n\nL-R: Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson and Joe Keery as Steve Harrington in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5\n\n“The Bridge” sets the team up for a crazy confrontation with Vecna as he aims to merge worlds by drawing The Abyss across the wormhole that is The Upside Down.\n\nHolly Wakes Up in Dimension X\n\nAfter Max wakes up to an emotional welcome from Lucas, Robin and Vickie, we finally learn where Vecna is keeping the 12 children hostage — a skeletal looking fortress in an alternate dimension, where they are attached to fleshy feeding tubes. He hangs in the air connected to similar tubes, seemingly drawing energy from the kids. When Holly comes back into her own body, she rips the tube from her mouth, coughs up those pesky black particles and tries to escape from the fortress. Vecna tracks her down and somehow pulls her back from her free fall towards the Hawkins Lab, where Jonathan and Nancy see her briefly before she’s yanked back into the sky.\n\nKay Fully Admits Her Big Plan\n\nIn a cut to Dr. Kay in The Upside Down lab where she blames Lt. Akers for the kidnapping of the 12 children, Kay screeches that if she had already found “the girl” (meaning Eleven), the demogorgons and other monsters from Dimension X would be in Russia fighting the Soviets, instead of threatening the existence of Americans.\n\nThis line is key, because it ties the whole show back around, particularly shining a light on the Russia plot lines in Season 4, where they were opening a gate in Kamchatka to try and replicate the success the Americans had had in harnessing the mysterious powers and beings lurking in these dark dimensions. This further explains why the Russians first came to Hawkins in Season 3 to try and crack open a closed gate underneath Starcourt Mall.\n\nThe fight for psychic children and access to the Upside Down and Dimension X can be boiled down to an arms race, of sorts. However, there are still a few missing pieces left to be answered on this front in the finale.\n\nDustin Diagrams The Upside Down\n\nBack at WSQK, Dustin explains the Upside Down and its connection to a dimension he’s dubbed “The Abyss.” D&D players like Erica and Mr. Clarke know The Abyss as a realm of chaos and true evil, and that’s what this dimension looks to be.\n\nDustin theorizes that Eleven created the wormhole by making psychic contact with the demogorgon back in Season 1, which did open the gate, or rift, that led to a lot of the creatures coming into Hawkins. As Henry has already explained it vaguely to his prisoners, he wants to merge Dimension X into Hawkins and create a new world.\n\nThe team comes up with a plan to counter this action, and Steve Harrington is at the center of it for once instead of being the one who needs an explanation. Using a flashlight and a Slinky, he suggests they wait for Vecna to draw the worlds closer and let him until the top of the radio tower is poking into the dimension, giving them direct access. Dustin adds one note to the plan – to drop a bomb on the Upside Down as they escape one final time and, hopefully, do away with the whole mess.\n\nWill’s Coming Out\n\nNoah Schnapp as Will Byers in ‘Stranger Things’ Netflix\n\nIn maybe the most heartfelt moment of Season 5 so far, Will braved coming out as gay to not only his close friends but the entire ensemble that has been fighting demons by his side since the day he got taken. This was prompted by a vision Vecna showed Will of a future where his friends worried about him living in a world not friendly to gay men, ultimately pushing his loved ones away as well. Will casted aside the shame so that he was no longer vulnerable to Vecna, who we know preys not just on weakness but specifically on guilt and shame in order to exploit his victims.\n\nWill’s sexuality hadn’t been outright confirmed, but seeds were planted in the earlier seasons when Joyce pointed out the slurs that kids called Will, including queer. Will’s bullies, and even his friends, also often made jokes abut how he didn’t like girls. In Season 3, when Will wanted to play D&D while all his friends would have rather hung out with their respective girlfriends, Mike made a particularly hurtful comment, saying he was sorry Will didn’t like girls.\n\nWill’s acceptance of his own sexuality, as well as his ability to make peace with the fact that Mike will likely not reciprocate those feelings, seems to be key to defeating Vecna in the looming finale.\n\nRELATED: Noah Schnapp Teases ‘Stranger Things’ Conclusion For Will & Mike’s Relationship: “Real, Authentic Representation”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:05:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T02:20:44.564031"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Vol. 2.\n\nThe penultimate episode of Stranger Things 5 offers fans a moment that they’ve been hoping for all season: a reunion between Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink).\n\nAt the very end of Episode 6, “Escape from Camazotz,” Max finally manages to make it out of Henry’s mindscape and wakes up from the coma she’s been in for nearly two years in the basement of the hospital, where Lucas had brought her to save her from the Demo dogs that Vecna had sent to kill her. The two share an emotional and vulnerable moment together as Max finds her way back to reality.\n\n“That moment, it almost felt real, because I wasn’t around her for so long,” McLaughlin told Deadline. Besides a few scenes of Lucas at Max’s bedside, this was the first moment they’d shared on-screen all season.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe scene is one of several tear-jerkers in the second volume of episodes, released on Christmas Day. In addition to a whirlwind of emotional sequences, the back half of the season is finally beginning to provide some answers about the Upside Down and the evils that Hawkins has been facing this whole time.\n\nIn the interview below, McLaughlin discusses working on these three episodes, including filming that scene with Sink and another equally moving one with Noah Schnapp, and what’s to come as the beloved series comes to an end.\n\nSTRANGER THINGS: SEASON 5.

Courtesy of Netflix /Netflix © 2025 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: I hear you’re about to go watch the finale with your castmates. How are you feeling about that?\n\nCALEB MCLAUGHLIN: I have a lot of anxiety and mixed emotions going into it. I think I’ve been, not uneasy, but I’m happy…but then now it’s the last content I will see of the show. So it’s a weird feeling. Not gonna lie, honestly, I’m like, I want to see it, but I wish it was two weeks ago to where I had more time for the anticipation of it all. But now it’s almost two hours into that moment, and it’s crazy.\n\nDEADLINE: Do you think you’ve made peace with the show ending?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I think I’ve definitely made peace with the show ending. I believe all great things come to an end, and to cherish the moment is for it to end. I think the story has done so well throughout the years, and it’s gonna go down in history as a classic, a show that people loved. I’m just happy. I’m happy to be a part of the legacy. So I’m happy to put this in a nice safe as one of the great things that I’ve done and move on to the next.\n\nDEADLINE: There is much to discuss from these episodes, but first I wanted to ask you about working with Sadie again on that emotional scene at the beginning of Episode 7 when Max and Lucas are finally reunited.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I mean, even her being in the coma in Episode 2, I guess she was still there, but last year, we rarely saw her. That moment, it almost felt real, because I wasn’t around her for so long. You miss your friend when you’re on set. You miss the camaraderie you both have. So I think with that, seeing that emotion that I had [access], to the state of mind that I had to be in, was a different emotion from Season 4, when he was losing her. In this moment, it was more of an emotion of relief and joy…it wasn’t sadness, it was happiness. But then also, at the same time, that feeling of loss, because now everything that he was feeling, he can now have this release.\n\nDEADLINE: Yeah, almost like he could finally let some of his emotions go after feeling like he had to be strong for her and for his friends for so long.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, he was able to be there for her when that happened. Like, ‘I never gave up. I never doubted a moment.’ And also, like, even I felt that he was still trying to hold it in [when she woke up], because he didn’t want to be the one crying. He had to be strong for her.\n\nDEADLINE: After Max wakes up and they rescue the rest of the crew from the Upside Down, the back half of Episode 7 features some of the first scenes with the entire cast together like this in quite some time. How did those moments feel to film?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Oh, man, it was hectic. I think every season, we always have that — the beginning, everyone’s around each other, and then we separate to go on our own journeys, and then we come back at the end. Last season, I was kind of not looking forward to those moments, because usually when we go to those moments, we know the show is ending. When you see everyone’s face and you’re having a good time, you start realizing time is going by. You see that the time that you had is no longer going to be there. So it was one of those. It was a lot of fun, because I had a lot of fun last season. It was my favorite time filming, because I got closer to everyone… just because of how big the show’s gotten, just these moments towards the end, is so much bigger than any moment we’ve ever had on the show. So I think that was spectacular.\n\nDEADLINE: Can you tell me a little about filming Noah’s coming out scene? It’s a really emotional scene and one that fans have been anticipating for some time. You all give very emotional and generous performances in that moment.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: Being on the show for so long, and knowing everyone’s had other ups and downs and, just me being a friend, just wanting to be there and knowing I’ll always be there for a friend, I think that scene was a moment that felt genuine. We would be there for Noah. We would be there for anyone in their hard times and their biggest secret moments where they want to be vulnerable. I think it’s important for stories like that to be told, to have those vulnerable moments. I mean, of course, we were acting, but it was important — even when we weren’t shown, we were there off screen, we [were] there behind the camera…So I think that scene was very special. Noah killed it. His performance was amazing. We had to do it a couple of times, and then we did it on another day as well, and he was able to bring it each time. Being able to be there as his friend, on and off screen, supporting him, especially not even just what the scene is, but just a big moment for an actor to tap into that emotion, I think being there for another actor, being there for a friend is always something that — I would want someone to be there for me. So I was just happy to be there in that moment and see him flourish.\n\nDEADLINE: What was your reaction to learning some of the details about the Upside Down and the mythology you all have been building for five seasons?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I think it was a whirlwind. It was a lot of shocking moments. I remember reading it and listening to the Duffers read the script. I was like, ‘Oh, this is good. Oh, yeah. This is how you bring this to a close.’ Sometimes TV shows or movies will create something, they’ll create this world that’s already good, and then make it more [complicated], and then it becomes less meaningful. I think these moments made it more meaningful, and it made it more grounded.\n\nDEADLINE: How was it to watch it and see what it really looked like? Because there’s a lot going on that Lucas doesn’t witness, or that none of the characters do, like the wormhole.\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I didn’t realize that was a thing until I watched it. There’s so much detail in this next volume, and there’s a lot of things you can miss even while reading, because they don’t explain how it is. It’ll be like a simple sentence, like, ‘we zoom out and there’s this wormhole,’ right? But then when you see it, you understand what they’re explaining. It’s a different perspective. I think that’s what was sick.\n\nDEADLINE: What can you tease about the finale?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: It’ll be our biggest yet. There will be a lot of range of emotions, but you’ll be satisfied with the story.\n\nDEADLINE: What are you looking forward to post-Stranger Things?\n\nMCLAUGHLIN: I’m excited for the new journey. I think being in the industry, being on the show for so long, there’s things that you’re like, ‘oh, I need to do this. I need to do that.’ It’s been full circle to where I realized I’m already doing it, and I just need to keep doing it and following my heart and knowing who I am, and I’m excited, because I feel like this is only the beginning in life, in my career…future projects next. Literally right after this press tour, I’m going into another press run for this movie I’m doing called Goat, an animated movie called Goat. So that’s the first movie I’m doing at the top of the year, so that’s a new beginning, and it’s also a wonderful story about a little goat wanting to be the, no pun intended, greatest of all time. Actually, the pun was intended. But yeah, so I’m excited for the future.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 03:45:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T03:48:04.911869"}

After four-and-a-half seasons of questions prompted by “Stranger Things,” in Volume 2 of the show’s fifth and final season, creators Matt and Ross Duffer offered answers aplenty, while also setting up the potentially tragic stakes of the series finale. That deadly new question — whether there’s any world in which Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) can live without her blood being the key ingredient for future weapons of mass destruction — will be answered when the show’s series finale, “The Rightside Up,” which drops on Dec. 31. But for now, let’s enumerate the big pieces of “Stranger Things” mythology we now understand after seeing “Shock Jock,” “Escape From Camazotz” and “The Bridge,” as well as how the show has continued to tie up emotional threads within this tight group of friends who’ve become a large, extended found family. Top of mind is how Will (Noah Schnapp) finally — finally! — comes out to his mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), his brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and his friends, as they all geared up to head into the Upside Down to fight Henry/Vecna/One (Jamie Campbell Bower) for the final battle. In “Sorcerer,” the climactic conclusion of Volume 1, Will harnessed his connection to Vecna, which had been forged when he was kidnapped into the Upside Down on Nov. 6, 1983. Channeling his Eleven-like powers, Will slayed Demogorgons, stopping them in mid-air, and the episode’s final image was him wiping his bloody nose (as Eleven does) from the exertion of it. Noah Schnapp Courtesy of Netflix Will had received those powers directly from Vecna: The first scene of Volume 1 revealed that Vecna plugged him into the hive while he was in the Upside Down. Will can use his powers for good, as we see, but Vecna can also use his connection to Will against him. He’s been creating the tunnels under Hawkins with his mind, using Will as his spy, just as he was in the second season. In Volume 2, Vecna uses Will to spy again to see where Max (Sadie Sink) is — a hospital bed in Hawkins — which puts her in physical danger. Not wanting any secrets to come between him and his friends, Will decides to come out to them, first by saying, “I don’t like girls,” and then going on to say that Vecna showed him a world in which he was alone because of his sexuality. “It just felt so real,” Will says, through tears. “You’ll never lose me,” Joyce tells Will, as Jonathan and then all of Will’s friends say the same, reinforcing their love and support for him before engulfing him in a hug. Other interpersonal storylines resolved in Volume 2 are the ongoing questions of what would happen to Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Jonathan as a couple, and why exactly Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) has been so angry at Steve (Joe Keery). After Nancy shoots what turns out to be the exotic matter that’s holding the Upside Down together, it causes a literal meltdown that threatens to drown them in goo. So, Nancy and Jonathan get real with one another, confessing everything from her hatred of The Clash to the fact that he never applied to Emerson for college (and that she knew). Jonathan takes out the engagement ring he’s been carrying around in a John Coltrane cassette, and says, “Nancy Wheeler, will you not marry me?” They remain, of course, bonded forever – but just as friends from now on. Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer Courtesy of Netflix Speaking of friends, after getting into a physical fight in the basement of the lab, Steve and Dustin separate in an angry snit. But after hearing the ruckus on the upper floors, Steve runs up the stairs to help Nancy, recklessly so. Dustin breaks down, saying he can’t lose Steve after he’s already lost Eddie for trying to be a hero. As Dustin sobs, Steve hugs him, finally understanding why Dustin has been protecting himself from getting hurt again by putting up a hostile front. As for the larger “Stranger Things” mysteries, it’s Dustin who figures out, having found the journals of Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine), that the Upside Down isn’t its own world or own dimension, but instead is a wormhole: a bridge to another world, one that Dustin names “the Abyss.” The Abyss, that red, Mars-like space we’ve seen before, is where Eleven sent Henry when she was a small child in Hawkins Lab after he revealed to her that he wanted her by his side in his plot to change (aka destroy!) the world. It’s where Henry evolved into Vecna, and where, at Brenner’s instruction, Eleven found Henry by using her powers, creating the Upside Down. “When you made remote contact with the Abyss, the bridge formed,” Dustin tells Eleven and the rest of the group as they formulate their plan. “And ever since, Henry and his army of monsters have been using it to cross right back into Hawkins.” The Abyss is also where Vecna retreated after he was nearly defeated in Season 4, Dustin says, to “lick his wounds” — which is why Eleven couldn’t find him. The show also begins to reveal how Henry’s powers came to be before the Creel family moved to Hawkins in the late 1950s. Max and Holly (Nell Fisher) tour Henry’s memories in an effort to get them out of Vecna’s mindscape, which Holly has named Camazotz, using the terminology of her favorite book, “A Wrinkle in Time.” They end up at the bottom of a mine shaft, watching as young Henry comes upon a panicked stranger protecting a silver briefcase — he shoots Henry in the hand so Henry, just a child, beats him to death with a rock. (This development is alluded to in the stage play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” when Brenner, Henry’s keeper after he murdered his parents, mentions that Henry had been found in a cave in Nevada after going missing on his 8th birthday. After that, Brenner says, Henry was different.) Henry opens the case, but we don’t see what happens after that — because Max pulls Holly away. “We will see that briefcase again,” Ross Duffer says. “You’re going to get the answers to those questions in the final episode.” Nell Fisher and Sadie Sink Courtesy of Netflix Henry’s powers (and their transmissibility) are essential to Eleven’s existential dilemma heading into the series finale. Kali/Eight (Linnea Berthelsen) reveals to Eleven she’d been held in a military lab because Dr. Kay was transfusing her blood into pregnant women in the hope that the fetuses would eventually develop her telekinetic powers. That’s how she learned, Kali then tells Eleven, that Brenner had similarly infused the biological mothers of all the kids in Hawkins Lab with Henry’s blood — resulting in Eleven becoming his perfect replica (and the other kids also developing powers). “They will find you,” Kali says. “And they will create more. Like Henry.” Those are the stakes of “The Right Side Up,” the Duffers say. Is Kali correct in saying that she and Eleven should hang back in the Upside Down as it’s destroyed, removing the threat of them ever being used again as weapons? Or is Mike (Finn Wolfhard) right when he says to Eleven that they’re the ones who get to decide how things will end? “You, me, Lucas, Will and Dustin,” Mike tells her. “Because this is our story.”\n\n“How can there be a happy ending here?” Matt Duffer asks rhetorically. “That’s the question going into the finale.”\n\nIn the interview below, the Duffers delve into that question, as well as writing Will’s coming out scene, when they decided what the Upside Down is, Henry’s backstory, how Max can help Eleven in the series finale — and much more.\n\nNoah Schnapp Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWill’s coming out scene! For Volume 1, we talked about how you wanted it to be that as Will “began to accept himself,” he’d be able to achieve the kind of strength he needed to access his powers. Did you always know you wanted Will to have a huge coming out scene with everyone as the final battle approached?\n\nRoss Duffer: Will’s coming out is something we’ve been talking about and wanting to do for a very long time. Originally, it was going to be in Season 4, and we just realized we didn’t have the space to do it properly. And I’m glad we didn’t, because it really gave us time to arc an entire season toward this — toward this one moment. And yes, he is starting to embrace himself, which we see in Volume 1.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBut what he realizes is that there’s still something in there that Vecna exploits — which is that he hasn’t told anyone about this. That ultimately led to the coming out scene. Originally, it was just going to be Joyce in the original draft of the outline. And the scene was not hitting properly. We realized that Joyce is an important part of this, but he really needed to do it in front of everyone.\n\n\n\nHow did you work with Noah Schnapp on that scene, both in the writing of it and on the day of filming it?\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: Ross and I spent longer writing that scene, I think, than certainly any other scene this year — if not ever. We were so concerned about getting it right. There were a lot of things that went into it. I mean, we’re definitely nervous about how it’s going to go over with everyone. But not as nervous as we were handing it over to Noah. Because ultimately, it needed to resonate and be truthful for him. We really were writing it to and for Noah. He wrote us sobbing after he read it. So it really worked and resonated for him, which was great.\n\nOn the day, frankly, there wasn’t really much direction at all. Noah spent a long time — I mean, months — prepping for that scene, that moment. Luckily, that script was done well in advance. I know he did a lot of work himself. It was a lot of pressure on the day, because not only are you performing this scene that you know is the most important scene for you in the season, you’re doing it in front of not just a crew, but basically all his fellow actors. And they were all there for him. The only thing we said was, “How do you want us to start? Where do you want the camera to be?”\n\nAnd most of what’s in there is the first take. It’s just one of those moments you always hope for when you’re working with an actor — he seemed to access something incredibly truthful. It didn’t feel like he was acting. I think Noah completely lost himself in that scene, and that take is what wound up in the show.\n\nWill doesn’t actually say, “I’m gay” — the way he frames his coming out is in different ways. Can you talk about how you wanted him to express himself?\n\nRoss Duffer: For us, it was just trying to make sure that the scene felt unique to both Will and unique for a coming out scene. For us, it was about the fears — because that’s what Vecna does. He preys on the fears, which allows us to explore whether it’s someone like Max, who’s dealing with trauma and depression, or in this case, Will.\n\nThe fear is something that Vecna, what he’s talking about, feels really real and grounded to Will, which is not that everyone’s going to make fun of him or be mean to him. It’s that everyone’s going to slowly withdraw from him. Talking about it like that, and then getting the reassurance from them — once we had that, then the arc of the scene seemed to make sense, and it felt very specific to both something that Vecna would do, but also to Will as a character. That’s when it really clicked, and that’s why it also helped to have everyone there, as opposed to just Joyce.\n\nMatt Duffer: I would just add that another thing that helped click it for us, and why he says, “I don’t like girls.” This came about once we added the other actors, his friends, into the scene: It’s about how they are so similar in every way. He’s talking about everything they share in common, and how little difference there is between them, and at the end of the day, there is no difference. They’re the same people they always were. There’s just one thing that’s different about him. That’s what he’s scared of sharing with them. And that’s why it felt right for him to express it that way.\n\nLinnea Berthelsen and Millie Bobby Brown Courtesy of Netflix\n\nSwitching topics! When, in writing the show, did you decide there were two different things, the Upside Down and the Abyss?\n\nMatt Duffer: That was something that I can say was early on. That was all the way back in Season 1: Netflix just wanted us to explain the mythology to them, because we were very adamant early on, “We don’t want to explain it in the show. We like that there’s mystery, and that there’s a lot that you don’t understand by the end of the season.” They said, “That’s fine, but we would like to know.” I think it was actually a really good exercise — we spent quite a bit of time with our writers figuring out exactly what the Upside Down was. We wrote a 20-page mythology document. It wasn’t called the Abyss at that point; it was called Dimension X, which is a Ninja Turtle reference.\n\nBut yeah, that’s been in there, baked in there, for a while. We’ve been holding those cards back for so long; it was a real relief to actually be able to show our hands here.\n\n\n\nCan you talk about creating the life and death stakes for Eleven going into the series finale? That if she survives, the military will just continue to hunt her down and make more of her from Henry’s blood?\n\nRoss Duffer: This is one of the reasons we want to bring Kali back — there’s really been dual threats throughout the run of “Stranger Things.” There is the supernatural threat, which is represented by Vecna this season. But the military has always posed a threat, from Season 1 on. Even when Brenner is gone, he gets continually replaced by someone else. In this case, in Season 5, by Kay. So we needed Kali to represent maybe a more pessimistic, but perhaps realistic, version, compared to Mike’s worldview of we’re gonna have butterflies and rainbows. And Kali’s going, “How is this going to work? And what is the solution here, that you can live a normal life?” That’s really a huge part of Eleven’s journey this season.\n\nSo did Eleven create the Upside Down? Because this is a debate we’ve been having at Variety since Season 4.\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: Oh! Yes. The answer is yes. Not her fault, I would say!\n\n\n\nIt was Brenner’s fault.\n\nMatt Duffer: She was forced to do that.\n\nWhen did you come up with the idea that Brenner had used Henry’s blood to create more Henrys — with El being the most successful manifestation of that — presumably to be Cold War-era weapons?\n\nMatt Duffer: I think that came about when we were working both on the play and Season 4, if I recall. Because so much of it ties into Henry, into One. Once we started to really explore that, we felt that it was interesting to then use that to explain and delve into where these powers actually originated from.\n\n\n\nIs there a way for Eleven not to have Henry’s blood in her?\n\nMatt Duffer: The idea is no, because we like that this is something that’s in her DNA. It’s unchangeable. There’s no magic antidote that’s going to solve this issue. And we like that, because it just creates a very complicated, messy situation.\n\nIt’s very easy to say, “Hey, we’re going to go fight the bad guy and defeat the evil!” But even if they’re able to do that and survive that, there’s this other, almost even darker, more complicated question on the other side of that.\n\nJoe Keery and Gaten Matarazzo Courtesy of Netflix\n\nHow is it that Steve, of all people, came up with the final plan of what they’re going to do?\n\nRoss Duffer: Well, Steve’s grown up a lot over the years. And particularly this season, he’s been beaten up a little bit by Dustin. He’s a little behind a lot of time; he’s like Donnie in “The Big Lebowski” sometimes, where he’s just a step or two behind. But Steve is a smart guy, and I think he’s shown that over the years. As we were working on that penultimate episode, we thought, “Who better to come up with the final — and arguably the most important plan — they’ve ever had than Steve ‘The Hair’ Harrington?'”\n\nMatt Duffer: And his favorite childhood story was “Jack and the Beanstalk.” That’s the other thing.\n\nIs the Abyss/Dimension X, the other world where Henry is, the place he originally entered as a child?\n\nMatt Duffer: Correct. Yes. I don’t think in the show we ever call it Dimension X — maybe that was in a script, and maybe we’ve referred to that in interviews. But it was never officially Dimension X. So that’s now always the Abyss, just to keep things as confusing as possible.\n\nJamie Campbell Bower Courtesy of Netflix\n\nShawn Levy told my colleague Jenny Maas in a postmortem coming out soon that the answer is no to them being the same thing. He said to ask you guys! He said he doesn’t think the Abyss is Dimension X.\n\nMatt Duffer: I’m gonna have to text him and clarify this for him.\n\nThe man with the briefcase that young Henry meets in that mine shaft — is there more to that story of how Henry got his powers that day that we’re going to see in the series finale?\n\nRoss Duffer: Yes, we will see that briefcase again. You’re going to get the answers to those questions in the final episode.\n\nMatt Duffer: You’ve only seen half of that core memory.\n\nI wanted to ask about other beats you wanted in Volume 2 as you wound the show down. We talked about Will coming out — Nancy and Jonathan figure themselves out, Dustin and Steve make up. Can you just talk about tying up threads and what you felt was essential to do?\n\nRoss Duffer: It was really important for us that all of our characters, as they head into the final battle, have really resolved those tensions or conflicts. That they’re all working on the same page — whether those conflicts are external with others, or internal with themselves. Because in our mind, if the party’s actually going to be able to defeat this great evil, they have to be all working at the best of their ability, and be all on the same page. So it was important just to resolve those tensions and conflicts. There’s one left, really.\n\nMatt Duffer: The Eleven one. The Eleven one is sort of the big outstanding issue that has not been resolved going in finale.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown Courtesy of Netflix\n\nMeaning, can Eleven survive and have the world be safe?\n\nMatt Duffer: Yes, exactly. How can there be a happy ending here? That’s the question going into the finale. Is Mike right, or is Kali right?\n\nCan you talk about how you resolved the Nancy-Jonathan story? Like, like an “I choose me” situation?\n\nMatt Duffer: Yeah, that was probably the scene we spent the second longest on. It’s quite a long scene; it’s complicated, what they’re going through. It’s very messy, because they do love each other very much, but we always felt that at the end of the day, they need to let each other go in order to grow as people and be independent.\n\nBut at the same time, there’s a very real — and I think a lot of people experience this — conflict, in the sense that they have gone through something very unique, and in their case, challenging. And how could anyone else ever understand them the way, say, Jonathan understands Nancy or vice versa, having not gone through this? Can they ever form a connection with someone that is as meaningful as this? But also, how do you grow as a person on your own? You need that independence.\n\nSo that was the idea behind the scene, and what we really wanted to explore. We had been planning to get there for a while, just figuring out how to exactly articulate that was challenging. But we’re really proud of that scene and, and specifically, how good Charlie and Natalia are.\n\nWhat was that goo, and why did it stop dripping, or whatever it was doing?\n\nRoss Duffer: We just wanted to put Jonathan and Nancy in a situation where they thought they were going to die — and, of course, don’t. But the backstory is that when the exotic matter, or dark matter, is disturbed, it disrupts the environment around, in this case, the lab, causing it to melt. But at a certain point — as you see earlier in Episode 5, when Jonathan and Nancy are on the upper levels of the lab — they see that this goo, this melted stuff, has hardened. At a certain point, it does harden. And in this case, we show how long it takes.\n\n\n\nMatt Duffer: You can think of it like the sun — the exotic matter is circular, and then as it dies down over time, the melting slows and stops. The nightmare scenario for Jonathan and Nancy would be end up like those soldiers you saw in the prior episode, where they get trapped.\n\n\n\nYou guys answered so much in 5, 6 and 7, but —\n\nMatt Duffer: The table is set, so to speak, going into the finale. But the big thing is Henry’s backstory specifically, and his connection to the Mind Flayer. So those are the two areas that I think are the most revelatory or impactful as we move into the final episode.\n\nSadie Sink and Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler Courtesy of Netflix\n\nHow useful can Max be, having spent a year and a half in Vecna’s mind?\n\n\n\nRoss Duffer: Pretty useful, because she knows she knows his memories, and that is where Eleven is going — she’s going into his mind, or into “Camazotz,” in order to fight him. So I think if Max hadn’t spent all that time there and hadn’t learned her way around, it would make this final battle nearly impossible.\n\nThe last time we talked, you still had work to do, and you weren’t there yet in terms of feeling like this experience was coming to an end. Where are you now?\n\nRoss Duffer: Well, we don’t have work to do anymore!\n\nMatt Duffer: It’s a weird feeling. We finished last week — or it was yanked away from us last week. I mean, we would be working on it for another year if we could.\n\nIt feels very odd. But on the other hand, we’ve been working on it for three years, and it felt right — the right time to let it go. And we’re just excited for people to finally see it.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 1 spoilers\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:31:56 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T04:38:57.592336"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.\n\nJamie Campbell Bower‘s Vecna only gets more terrifying in Volume 2 of the final season, which sees the monster get another step closer to enacting his plan to merge the human world with another dimension.\n\nAs viewers learn over the course of the three episodes, the Upside Down is a wormhole that has connected Hawkins to this alternate dimension that Dustin dubs “The Abyss,” which they believe is the true home of the mind flayer, the demogorgons, and the rest of the evils that have been haunting them for the past four years — even, it seems, Henry Creel.\n\nThe characters have been completely unable to locate Vecna all season, because, as it turns out, he’s been hiding in this alternate dimension that they were unaware of and can’t access (since it is situated thousands of yards above them). While they’re unraveling this mystery, Vecna is busy trying to keep Holly (Nell Fisher) and Max (Sadie Sink) from escaping his mind prison. The girls realize that, in order to get out, they’ll need to trek their way through Henry’s memories instead of their own, leading to a heartbreaking moment where they witness a very young Henry murder a man he encounters…in a cave. This seems to give insights on why Henry won’t enter the cave that Max and Holly have been hiding in within his mind, though there are still some questions left to be answered in the finale.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWhile Max manages to get out, Holly isn’t so lucky. By the end of the penultimate episode, she’s back in his clutches and Henry begins his process to merge the worlds, teasing one final face off to come in the 2-hour finale.\n\n“[Episode] 8 comes in steaming hot, right off the back of 7. It’s go time. It’s really, really explosive,” Campbell Bower tells Deadline.\n\nIn the interview below, the actor unpacks his descent further into the madness of Henry Creel for Volume 2 of the fifth and final season of Stranger Things.\n\nL-R: Noah Schnapp as Will Byers and Jamie Campbell Bower as Vecna in ‘Stranger Things’ Season 5 Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: Was any of this information we’ve learned about Henry since Season 4 pitched to you when you took the role? How much did you initially know?\n\nJAMIE CAMPBELL BOWER: I don’t think any of it was pitched to me when I joined. I do remember towards the end of filming the Henry portion of Season 4, Matt and Ross, sort of, we had a little aside conversation, and they were like, ‘This has been amazing. We were always going to bring you back as Vecna, but now we feel like we should bring you back more as you.’ and I was just like, ‘Cool. Sounds great. Whatever you guys want.’ So, with regards to the story arc, none of it was pitched to me, and I think it was, from what I’ve heard and read from Matt and Ross, it was something that sort of developed in the in-between time.\n\nDEADLINE: I do really enjoy that we get to see more of Henry this season. And I’m curious how it was for you working with some of these younger kids, especially having to be so cruel to them? What did you gain from that experience? Because they’re giving you so much back emotionally. And I wonder, for you as such a as a more seasoned, older actor, how that was to kind of get to play in that sandbox with them.\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: It was awesome. I mean, there were definitely times where it was terrifying for me. I’ve been vocal about this today and when we were discussing the first chapters as well. The Mr. Whatsit side of things, this is a presentation, and the intention is buried. So when you’re sat opposite a child, burying the intention, children, naturally, can see through the BS and lies. It’s a very terrifying experience at times to be sat there…but it was also a lot of fun too, because the kids were so great. There was so many funny moments where we’d be playing games between takes, and particularly that last scene in Episode 7, where we’re all sat round the table, it was one of the first times where, I mean, you know, obviously, aside from the beginning of five, we were all together, and we had a lovely day. It was just a beautiful, fun experience to play with them. They’re so great and so receptive, and it was a joy to be able to get to know them and work with them. All of them are amazing. I love Jake dearly. I just think he’s the loveliest boy, and I got to know his family too, and he’s just a great kid. I’m so glad that the fan base and the world has taken Derek into their hearts. It was always the thing that I hoped most for him. I was like, ‘He’s so cool. I hope that that happens,’ and it has, and I’m so happy for him.\n\nDEADLINE: You’ve talked about Henry and especially Vecna’s head being a hard place to live in as an actor, and I’m curious how this was for you to get to unpack some of what happened to him as he was a kid? I’m thinking particularly about the scene where we get to see Henry as a young boy kill that scientist in the cave, and that’s a really jarring scene.\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: It is something that I thought about going into Season 4, even, and had qualified between 4 and 5 when I went to go and see the play. So, getting to play those scenes out, I felt at times like a huge release, and it was also really important for me to go into those scenes understanding the trauma and the experience to bring that level of humanity forward. I’ve been describing Henry this season, and the way I approached it as, like, memory retention, but buried far away. So when I get to uncover that, dig that up, it does humanize the experience and the character for me, because there are times where I feel wildly inhuman, monstrous, and I know that sounds obvious, but like truly monstrous. So I took great pleasure in those moments for sure.\n\nDEADLINE: There’s a scene in Episode [5] that I really like where we see in real time Henry kind of transitioned from One to Vecna. How did you think about the subtle differences in the evolution of that character throughout those periods of time to be able to pull off something like that?\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: I mean, I think it was always that thing of, like, the mask failing, it falling away, and where I got to with Henry at the end of Episode 7 of Season 4 was the way in which I wanted to be bringing him back when we saw him again. It was in that emotional space. Having lived in Mr. Whatsit already in Season 5, there is a difference for me between them, subtle though it may be, there is a difference. So yes, there are emotional differences and difficulties, but also physical [ones]. That particular moment, the physicality of that was something that we worked on with, actually, with somebody who works in the video game space, and using things like called nodes, which are like particular moments that you strike and that you’ll come back to. So the shift between Whatsit and Henry was something that we worked on off set prior to shooting it.\n\nI was going through my videos the other day, and I’m there on the stage doing it, trying out different things, trying out how I wanted my head to move and where my arms were going to be. Yes, that is a very short moment, but it is something that we spent a long time on, just to make sure that it was right and that it felt cool. So much of that is about intuition and the work that goes into it beforehand, so that when you get into the space, it’s just like, ‘Oh, this is what naturally these characters would do here.’ It was really fun. It was really cool to do the sort of more shape-shifty bits. In England, we have three exams in your years between, like, 13 and 18, and the middle one is called your AS (Advanced Subsidiary) Levels, and I did dance AS Levels. I got to lean quite heavily into that dance side of my childhood, which was really fun. It was nice to know that that was still in there, and, God, like it hasn’t completely gone.\n\nJamie Campbell Bower as Henry Creel in ‘Stranger Things’ Courtesy of Netflix\n\nDEADLINE: How you view, emotionally, that separation between Henry and Vecna? Is it just a loss of humanity? How do you make that distinction in your head when you’re playing those characters?\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: I mean, it depends on what we’re referring to as a loss of humanity, really. Because, is it the distance from the heart, or is it like monstrous in the sense of monsters? I think Henry was so close, was much closer to innocence, was much closer to the experiences, and then when he was sent to that slippery, veiny demise at the end of [Season] 4, it became about resentment, and at that point, it felt like humanity had gone. It felt like the possibility of love was so far away. I refer to love as that thing that keeps us alive, and so I think Henry, if we look at it this way, like Henry is close to innocence, Whatsit is further removed, and Vecna is just like…it’s impossible — virtually impossible — for there to be anything that feels like love.\n\nDEADLINE: What are you excited for from the finale, and what you ultimately hope people take away from this character that you’ve spent so much time thinking about and playing?\n\nCAMPBELL BOWER: So with regards to what we can expect for the finale, I am genuinely, really excited for Episode 8 to come out. I feel like Episode 7 is — because I obviously know what’s coming in 8, and we do leave on quite, in my opinion, knowing what’s coming, quite a hefty cliffhanger, and 8 comes in steaming hot, right off the back of 7. It’s go time. It’s really, really explosive. I’m really excited for people to see that, because I know how it felt to work on it, too, and that’s really cool. What do I hope people take away from this character? Wow, I’m still in process on that. Like, I’m genuinely still in process on that, because I spent so much time in it, and I don’t know if I can yet see the wood from the trees. I’m not sure. So much of this character is based on the idea of loneliness. So much of this character is based on the idea of salvation. I had to fall in love, and I did fall in love with Henry Creel. I had to want to protect him. I had to want to nurture him and love him, because that’s my duty as the person that’s playing him. I have to understand him, and I don’t know how it feels to be a viewer, yet, watching that from afar, I don’t know. I’d have to give myself another six months to truly be able to absorb that.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T04:38:58.106394"}

This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.\n\nWill Byers (Noah Schnapp) takes a big leap of faith in the penultimate episode of Stranger Things 5.\n\nAfter escaping Vecna’s mind invasion, Will realizes that he’ll continue to be vulnerable to the monster unless he comes clean about a secret he’s been keeping. So, rather than continue to let Vecna pray on his guilt and shame, he takes control of his own destiny. In a moving scene in Episode 7, “The Bridge,” Will comes out as gay in front of all of his friends and family.\n\n“It was so freeing. I mean, there’s been so much build up for this scene for so long. Since, I would argue, episode one of the first season,” Schnapp tells Deadline. “So getting to finally have that moment and just have that dialogue… Will is always speaking through so much of his facial expressions, but to actually verbalize his emotions and express them to everyone was so freeing to finally get to do.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWhile this is the first time that Will has said out loud that he doesn’t like girls, creators Matt and Ross Duffer seemed to be dropping hints regarding his sexuality in earlier seasons. Throughout Season 5, it became much more obvious when Will found out about Robin’s (Maya Hawke) relationship with Vickie (Amybeth McNulty) and began peppering his friend with questions about how she came to terms with her own sexuality.\n\nBut, it isn’t until he’s tortured again by Vecna that he realizes the only way forward is to open up about this part of his identity. In part, Schnapp says, Will refrained from doing so sooner because, even though he’d come to accept his sexuality, he was still grappling with his feelings for his best friend, Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard).\n\nBy the time he comes clean, Schnapp thinks he’s made peace with the fact that Mike is likely not going to reciprocate those feelings — a realization he says felt quite relatable.\n\n“He accepts his own identity by the first volume, and that’s what allows him to unleash these powers,” Schnapp explains. “But then, like he says, it takes him through kind of Volume 2 to really understand that it was never about [Mike], it’s about himself. I mean, I think it was just really well done and really authentic to how the story unfolds. I know I could definitely relate to some of those feelings of being in love with a best friend who’s not in love with you. It feels [like a] realistic representation of being queer and growing up.”\n\nNoah Schnapp as Will Byers and Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler in ‘Stranger Things: Season 5’ Courtesy of Netflix\n\nSchnapp has been very vocal about his thoughts on Will’s sexuality, though it was never explicitly confirmed by series creators Matt and Ross Duffer before now, which has only fueled online discussion as fans began to suspect that it might play a pivotal role in his Season 5 arc. As he pointed out, the series has been alluding to this moment since Season 1, when Will’s friends used to tease him about not liking girls.\n\nNow, creators Matt and Ross Duffer admit the scene is “something we’ve been building to for a long time,” as the latter tells Deadline.\n\n“I think mostly we were nervous, as we just wanted to do right by Noah. Obviously, we’ve been working with him for so long, since he was a little kid, and we knew that this scene, obviously, we’ve talked about it over the years with him,” Ross continued. “We knew it was important, and we all wanted to get it right. There’s not a scene, I don’t think, in the entire series that we spent as long on as we did that coming out scene, just working it and working it until it felt right to us.”\n\nHow did they know when they got it right? Getting the seal of approval from the actor who has been playing the character for a decade and arguably knows him better than anyone.\n\n“The litmus test was giving it to Noah, but then seeing how he responded to it and reacted to it gave us confidence,” Ross added.\n\nSchnapp says that, in some ways, Will’s coming out felt parallel to his own, allowing him to draw from his own experience to access his character’s emotions for that moment and “make it feel so real.” Still, there were some cultural and political differences in the 40-year span between the two boys’ revelations that the actor wanted to ensure were taken seriously as well.\n\n“[It was about] making sure I really understood the environment and the landscape that I’m declaring this in, where the AIDS epidemic was rampant, the Reagan administration wouldn’t even acknowledge that gay was a real word. If you even so much as came out, people thought you were sick and were contagious,” he said.\n\nWill has a genuine concern that he “could be abandoned and lose everything,” Schnapp says, “so just having the stakes in my head that I really wanted to make sure I got right.”\n\n“I just, of course, wanted it to feel as authentic as possible. It’s such an important scene, because it’s going to affect so many real young Wills out there struggling with their own identity, and I wanted it to be perfect for them and do justice to this character, which has been leading up to this for so long. So, yeah, just making it feel as authentic and natural as possible,” he continued.\n\n(L to R) Noah Schnapp as Will Byers, Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler, and Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers Netflix\n\nDuring the scene, Will breaks down as he confesses that Vecna had tried to convince him that his loved ones wouldn’t stand by him if they knew the truth. While he was trapped in Vecna’s mindscape, he says the monster showed him a false reality where he lost several of them to this admission. It wasn’t that they outright rejected him, but according to Vecna’s vision of the future, many began to slowly distance themselves from him once he revealed his full self. He says he hopes that, by telling them the truth, he can prove to himself — and to Vecna — that won’t happen.\n\nWhile trepidatious at first, once Will begins his monologue, the words just start pouring out of him, almost uncontrollably.\n\n“He had [the scene] months in advance, and he just worked it and worked it,” Ross Duffer recalls. “I remember him telling us…he wanted to not even have to think about the words on the day, because it would just allow him to sort of access this part of himself where he’s not thinking about the language of it all, he’s just letting the emotion come through. That’s exactly what we did, and we’re so proud of him [and] what he accomplished on that thing.”\n\nTo his relief, Will is met with unwavering support from everyone in the room. And, when it came time to film the scene, so, too, was Schnapp. To capture both Schnapp’s performance and the reactions of the rest of the cast took an entire 12-hour production day, after which Matt Duffer says the actor “looked like he was about to collapse.”\n\nEven when the camera was firmly on Schnapp, the rest of the cast made sure to be there for every single take. Likewise, Schnapp repeated the lengthy speech several times with the same fervor when the cameras were focused on coverage of everyone else.\n\n“He poured everything into every single take,” Matt said. “I think that brought out these incredible performances in [the cast], and I think they got lost in what he was saying, and it was moving them in a very real way, because Noah was very, very, very emotional that day, and very moving.”\n\nAs a result, says Shawn Levy, who directed the episode with the Duffers, “the thing that makes that scene even more beautiful and memorable is the reactions of the other characters and actors.”\n\nThroughout Will’s speech, the camera cuts repeatedly to Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Robin, who are both beaming with pride at his extraordinary display of vulnerability, and the rest of the teenager’s closest confidantes — all of whom are giving them their undivided attention as he pours his heart out to them.\n\nUsually, “it’s always so loud and chaotic on set, especially when the whole cast is there. There is no silence. Everyone’s messing around. Everyone’s making jokes,” Schnapp says. But, on that day, “you could hear a pin drop.”\n\nStranger Things 5\n\n“They were so respectful and gave me so much space to get into the character, which I really appreciated. I didn’t really get to fully take note of all their reactions, just because there’s so many people in the room, and I’m so emotional,” he continued. “So it really only hit me after, when I watched it, seeing how genuine it felt. And then, of course, when we cut the cameras, Charlie and I started hugging and crying for real. So it definitely hit home.”\n\nWill’s coming out is a big milestone not only in his personal life but also, presumably, in the fight against Vecna. As for how things will pan out in that department, Schnapp is staying quiet for now.\n\n“I guess you’re gonna have to wait and see,” he teased. “I’m excited to to share it with the world.”\n\nThe finale of Stranger Things arrives on December 31.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T04:38:58.435499"}

The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art graduate, who gained recognition [&#8230;]", "content": "Rukmini Vasanth is having a moment. Fresh off Rishab Shetty‘s blockbuster “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” the Indian actor has Yash‘s “Toxic” and a Prashanth Neel film with NTR Jr. on deck, and her approach is clear: women with agency who make decisive choices.\n\nThe Royal Academy of Dramatic Art graduate, who gained recognition for her nuanced work in the critically acclaimed “Sapta Sagaradaache Ello” films (2023) opposite Rakshit Shetty, tells Variety that her performance as Kanakavathi in Rishab Shetty’s mythological prequel was carefully architected from the start.\n\nSet centuries before the events of the 2022 sleeper hit, “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” follows the conflict over sacred forest land, with Vasanth’s character harboring secret ambitions that ultimately drive the narrative. The pivotal nature of her role was established from her first meeting with Shetty and his writing team of Anirudh Mahesh and Shanil Guru, with the character’s carefully concealed motivations and dramatic reveal integral to the film’s structure from the beginning.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“When Sir [Rishab Shetty] called me in for my first narration with him, and he told me upfront that this is all going to hinge on this girl’s sudden twist and the deep-held desire of hers to take over this land that she doesn’t reveal until the last moment,” Vasanth says. “That was very much planned, and that was something that I walked into fully aware of from the first meeting.”\n\nThe actor acknowledges the responsibility was daunting, particularly given the massive success of the first “Kantara” film. However, the prequel’s distinct historical setting and visual identity helped establish different audience expectations.\n\n“From all the material that the film’s team had released, audiences were kind of prepared for the fact that this is a very different world that we’re going into,” she explains. “It’s not the same 1990s Kundapura that we had seen in the previous film. This is a very different world, and I think that leveling of the ground helped me because I didn’t feel as if people were expecting to see a certain kind of character.”\n\nBringing her London drama school training to bear, Vasanth discusses the challenge of calibrating performance style to match the scale of “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” while maintaining emotional authenticity – a marked departure from her breakthrough work in Hemanth M. Rao’s “Sapta Sagaradaache Ello” films, which she describes as prizing silence and spaces within dialogue and interaction.\n\n“One of the beautiful things that I’ve been able to learn over my career is which style and where it belongs,” she says. “In the world of ‘Kantara: Chapter 1,’ some of the more restrained stuff can look too subtle to register because the scale is so large that you need to be able to match that scale.”\n\nVasanth uses a vivid analogy to explain her approach to calibrating performance. “You kind of need to regulate what is needed of you,” she says. “It’s like speaking – in a quiet living room, you can afford to whisper, but if you’re in the tube, you need to shout a little bit.”\n\nRukmini Vasanth – “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1” Hombale Films\n\nThe actor credits her disciplined approach to her background, with a father in the military and a mother who is a dancer. However, she emphasizes that her time at drama school was where she truly internalized the necessity of preparation and consistency.\n\n“The discipline and preparation gives you the ability to show up regardless of what the outside variables may be,” Vasanth says. “You can’t really be too precious about the kinds of environments that you require in order to put out a good performance for a film that deserves that.”\n\nShe describes the challenging production conditions on “Kantara: A Legend – Chapter 1,” with constant rain and limited shooting windows. “You’d have the crew members carrying these giant rigs up and down a hill. So at that point you can’t really be like, it doesn’t feel right to me. You just have to get on with it and do it as well as you possibly can.”\n\nLooking at her filmography, Vasanth has gravitated toward characters who are emotionally decisive, even when constrained by circumstances. She attributes this pattern to what makes for compelling storytelling.\n\n“Characters that make decisions, that may not be the right ones necessarily or the wrong ones, but that make decisions of some kind, and then that pulls the story along – I think I know what to do in those moments,” she says. “It’s just women with some sort of agency doing things.”\n\nVasanth’s upcoming projects include “The Elder One” director Geethu Mohandas’ highly anticipated “Toxic” opposite “K.G.F” star Yash, and a film with “Salaar” and “K.G.F” filmmaker Prashanth Neel featuring “RRR” lead NTR Jr.\n\nOf “Toxic,” she says that it has challenged her in unprecedented ways. “It’s unlike anything that I’ve taken on before, which has equal doses of nerves to see how it unfolds,” she says. “The working style has been really, really fascinating and very different from anything I’ve encountered. The way that Yash Sir and Geethu approach this film, the scripts, the way that we’ve gone about shooting has been an incomparable experience for me.”\n\nAs for working with Neel and NTR Jr., she praises their continued enthusiasm for the craft. “It’s always very lovely when you work with people who come with such a strong body of work, but are very unencumbered by whatever that may have brought. You still see the sense of play and the sense of enjoyment.”\n\nOn the topic of pan-India casting, Vasanth suggests the label is more relevant to the commercial side of cinema than the creative. She points to historical precedents, including actor-director V. Ravichandran’s multi-industry production “Shanti Kranti” (1991).\n\n“I think pan-India films have been happening. They’ve been attempted for a really long time,” she says. “Those are just labels and actors have been working across multiple industries all the time. We’re all very lucky that it’s successful and lucrative also now.”\n\nVasanth is now working across multiple South Indian film industries, with upcoming projects in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu cinema, representing a new generation of actors operating fluidly across linguistic markets.

For the first time in their more-than-a-decade-long history, they would use their uninterrupted alone time to tell each other the truth about how they feel. No more burying their emotions or expressing them in a language the other can’t understand –– no matter how beautiful Ilya’s Russian revelation was in Episode 5.\n\nIt didn’t take long for them to make good on that promise. Ilya teased Shane about maybe marrying his best friend, Svetlana (Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova), or another woman so as not to blow their cover. But then he admitted he had a problem –– none of those women were Shane. Shane, in turn, pulled an all-nighter churning out a plan for them to slowly ease the world into the idea of their relationship, starting with Ilya joining the Ottawa team to be closer to him in Montreal, and then they would co-found a charity to start melting the supposedly frigid animosity between them. It was a long-game plan, but the mere mental gymnastics of trying to set up their future together moved Ilya to tears, and left him coughing up those three words–– “I love you.” Shane immediately reciprocated it with lightning-fast urgency, obliterating one of the last barriers between them.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHudson Williams, Connor Storrie, Dylan Walsh and Christina Chang Courtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\nFrom there, the tenor of their cottage getaway changed, and ultimately felt more romantic than ever. That is, until Shane’s dad, David (Dylan Walsh), walked in on them kissing and fled before his son could explain. Shane had put off telling his parents about being gay or loving his archrival. But now, Shane and Ilya both went to see David and Yuna (Christina Chang) to break the news. It was a tough pill to swallow, but not because they don’t approve of their son. Rather, it completely shatters his hockey-loving parents’ 10-year-plus belief they hated each other. Instead, they finally see two young men, who have been crazy about each other since rookie year (or rather, the summer before!), now sitting at the Hollanders’ dinner table as a couple. Ilya even comforts Shane in a moment of panic by calling him his boyfriend, a simple but monumental step for Hollanov, as the internet has dubbed them.\n\nSeason 1 ends as the boys drive back to their refuge away from the world, staring down a beautiful sunset that hides everything that waits on the other side of their cottage chapter, which will play out in an already-ordered Season 2. That’s a little different from the conclusion of Rachel Reid’s book, on which the series is based, in which they launch their foundation to lay the groundwork for the future. However, series creator/writer/director Jacob Tierney wanted something more romantic for his final shot, just in case the series didn’t become the phenomenon that it has.\n\n“I wanted to leave the viewer with what the book left me with emotionally, which was the warm, fuzzy feeling of them getting to be happy together,” Tierney tells Variety. “I thought of doing something with just a bit of elegance, and there’s a simplicity to the two of them in a car, driving off into the sunset, and not over a cliff. That was all I ever wanted out of this story.”\n\nBelow, Tierney tells Variety about how he pulled the much-anticipated cottage episode together; whether fan-favorite couple Scott (François Arnaud) and Kip (Robbie GK) will play a bigger role in Season 2 — and why he thinks women have gravitated toward this unabashedly queer love story between two men.\n\nThere are some things that happen at the cottage in Rachel Reid’s book that aren’t here in the finale. Shane and Illya playing against each other in Shane’s hockey training facility, and a pretty explosive oral sex scene that could have been an homage to the beginning of “Queer As Folk.” How did you figure out what would make the cut for your version for this chapter for Shane and Ilya?\n\nI wanted to make sure we were still on the same journey with them, and still learning things about them. If we are talking specifically about the sex scenes in the book, they’d eaten ass in Episode 2, so I didn’t really feel like I needed to hit that hard here. I wanted to make sure that we were still watching this change and evolve for them, and the sex that we were seeing this time around was more intimate, playful and sweet. And as evolved as it could be, particularly from the stuff that we were seeing in Episodes 1 and 2. Ultimately, the stuff that mattered to me at the cottage was the stuff that continued the journey of understanding them and their relationship. There was no set agenda. It ended up being the stuff I remember from reading it, if I’m being honest.\n\n5 Courtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\nBy the end of the episode, they have learned to better communicate with each other. Not perfectly, but previously sex was their only means of doing that. Does that mean you envision less sex in Season 2, and more sitting on the couch scrolling their phones and touching toes now that they can use their words more efficiently?\n\nOh, the touching toes! I love that scene. You know, Rachel talks a lot about the promise that I made to her to take her characters seriously. She takes them very seriously in “The Long Game,” and that doesn’t mean there’s no sex. There’s quite a bit of sex in “The Long Game.” But I think it functions differently in the second book, and that’s just what I want to do. The journey of this show, no matter how long it goes on for, will always be centered around the relationship between Shane and Ilya. Sex will always be a big part of it, like it is with any romantic relationship. But it’s really about continuing that progress of what happens after that first blush of love, what happens after you decide you’re in love and how do you sustain it? That’s a very adult question: “We love each other, and now what? Does that mean everything’s easy?” No, it does not. There’s loads of challenges that get thrown Shane and Ilya’s way. Beyond what’s in the books, I really don’t have an agenda besides that I love this couple and I love these characters, and I want to just hang out with them more and watch them grow more and watch them become better for each other.\n\nSince you loved the touching toes scene, was that something you planned ahead of time or was it a choice you and Hudson and Connor made in the moment while filming?\n\nNo, that was planned. What I really wanted to be part of the cottage episode was that, when you’re in a relationship, you’re just doing things like being on your phones at the same time. I want them to live in the real world, and to do those little things that people do when they are in a relationship, because Shane and Ilya are. They can’t always be fucking. God knows, that’s just exhausting! I just wanted to capture little normal couple moments and I don’t think I’m the only one in a relationship who occasionally sits on a couch scrolling on our phones separately and then showing our partner what we are seeing.\n\nIt certainly shows how far they have come since their fleeting hotel meetups. But there is still a little bit of Reid’s book that you don’t cover in the finale. In the book, months later they announce Shane’s big plan to start a foundation together, the first step in chipping away at their rivalry until they can come out as a couple. But your season ends with them riding home from Shane’s parents’ house in the car, just holding hands and laughing. Do you see Season 2 starting with that announcement, or was this your end to the first book?\n\nWell, books are so different from TV and I didn’t know if I was even going to get to make more of these. As much as I care about their charity and what they’re going to do, I don’t know that we need a bunch of exposition at the end of a season of TV like this. I wanted to leave the viewer with what the book left me with emotionally, which was the kind of warm, fuzzy feeling of them getting to be happy together. I thought of doing something with just a bit of elegance, and there’s a simplicity to the two of them in a car, driving off into the sunset, and not over a cliff. That was all I ever wanted out of this story.\n\nPart of the balancing act of the storytelling for me was always that you get this big moment with Scott and Kip in the last episode. It is this massive rom-com public declaration of love, and what I love about Shane and Ilya’s story is that you get another version of that kind of happiness, which is this small moment with the two of them just being allowed to be in love. That was the sweetest ending I could come up with for them, for now.\n\nSpeaking of Scott and Kip, there has been such an enthusiasm for them, maybe more than some people expected. Last week’s episode, which ended on Scott bringing Kip out on the ice to announce their relationship, now shares the top spot on IMDb’s list of the highest-rated episodes of television of all time. Does that encourage you to include more of their story in Season 2, or do you foresee keeping this format of seeing them when they intersect with Shane and Ilya?\n\nThis will continue to be Shane and Ilya’s story, and Scott and Kip will continue to intersect with them on occasion. But just because “Heated Rivalry” is Shane and Ilya’s story doesn’t mean that precludes potentially doing stuff with Scott and Kip outside of that specific show. We optioned all Rachel’s books, and part of the reason we did that was because, obviously, these characters appear throughout all the books. There’s a real richness to a lot of the stories there, and fans will know that Scott and Kip feature very strongly in “Common Goal.” They are all over the place. I don’t know exactly what we’re going to do yet, but there are places we could go with them that I would definitely be excited to explore.\n\nCourtesy of Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max\n\nIn the finale, we get a scene with Shane and his mom, Yuna, after he comes out. This is a bit of a change from the book, where the conversation is entirely between Shane, Ilya, Yuna and David. Why did you give Shane and his mom this separate moment?\n\nYuna is such a crucial character in the story. I know it’s not always on display in this season, but as fans of the books know, Yuna is such a big part of both Shane and Ilya’s lives moving forward. In trying to take this stuff seriously, I wanted to show complicated, interesting adult relationships here, and that includes the parents. It was just really important to me for Shane and Yuna to have a conversation. They needed to have a moment together. They’re obviously very close. They’re obviously very similar, and his mom has very similar blinders that he does. So there’s something really important about reminding people that even though we can hurt each other in these relationships, and they can be difficult, there is love and allyship there as well. Sometimes, it just requires a little conversation.\n\nThe queer community is understandably hooked by this show, but there has also been an intense embrace from female viewers, specifically straight women. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think that’s a very complicated question, and there are a lot of answers to it. Women love these books. These are books written by a woman. These are books largely consumed by women. So I wouldn’t want to speak on behalf of a female audience, but I think that what women are presented in romance is not always something that interests them in that way. I think that women are also, in real life and in culture, endlessly exposed to sexual violence. Seeing things like this, that are depictions ultimately of male vulnerability, can be very refreshing. From what I’ve heard, from the women who have written to me and Rachel and the boys, there’s a safety in seeing a woman being removed from the conversation. So you’re watching something happen between two men, and there is no fear of violence. There is no fear of things turning into stuff that women have to deal with too much in real life, and don’t want to deal with in their fantasies, and ultimately, this is a romantic fantasy. I think it’s also that maybe romance — which is a genre that women love and write and read and are the primary consumers of — just doesn’t get treated with a lot of respect. Nor do the people that make it, or those that adapt it either. So I think that they are responding to, at least I hope, the fact that we came to it pretty fullhearted, and as fans and as people who want to honor this material and want to honor the genre and make it as romantic as we can. That’s certainly what I wanted to do.\n\nEvery week, despite the soaring success of your show, you have had to respond to controversies and people wanting to tear it down. This week, Hudson responded to Deuxmoi’s comments about his personal life, and who he might be dating. But Deuxmoi also said the show has no plot and bad acting. What do you say to opinions like that?\n\nThis show wouldn’t work if any of that were true. I mean, it just wouldn’t. Nobody would give a shit about this if the acting was bad, or if there was no story. I think this is a show that actually requires you to pay attention. If you’re glib and you’re on your phone the whole time, or you’re looking to not pay attention, then God bless, and do whatever you want. But you have to be there in the moment if you want to watch. This is a show where there’s a lot of communication between the lines. It’s a lot about behavior. It’s a lot about watching. And if you don’t have the attention span for it or the interest, then I’m gonna be super honest with you. I could give a fuck what Deuxmoi’s criticism is of the show. I literally don’t even know who these people are. I don’t give a fuck what they think about anything. But I understand that, from what I have read multiple times now, people say this is a show that is not a co-viewing experience. You can’t be on your phone. If you wanna get what it’s doing, you have to pay attention to it. It’s definitely made to hold your attention. And if it doesn’t, then that’s a good criticism too. This is not for everybody, and that is A-OK. But I think at a certain point, the show speaks for itself, and the reaction to it speaks for itself, and there’s no way that these boys would be on the receiving end of the attention that they’re getting if they weren’t good. The papa bear in me does not like comments like this, obviously, because I know how hard they work. I think they’re fucking amazing. But we also live in a time where everybody gets their opinion, then they get to put it out on whatever platform they have, and so I get it. Keep doing your thing, Deuxmoi!\n\nLooking ahead to Season 2, you’ve spoken about how you haven’t started writing yet, but is there anything specific you are most looking forward to adapting from “The Long Game?”\n\nThere’s so many new characters that are going to be really fun to bring in. But I think that next season will end up feeling different because it’s a more focused book. It takes place over a shorter amount of time. There’s more a sense of getting to know that team in Ottawa that Ilya is going to play for and getting to know Hayden and Jackie more. And there’s more Yuna and David. Hopefully what will happen, like with any good second season in general, is that we will get to enrich the stuff you already know and how those threads began, and then pull on them and really get into it. But I’m also really looking forward to seeing Ilya in therapy. It’s probably a really good thing for him. I know that my therapist has been crucial to getting through the past few months.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 06:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T06:40:26.106149"}

His own father derisively called him queer, as his mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) recounts early in Season 1. And while he shared his friends’ affinity for playing Dungeons & Dragons, biking around town and geeking out on the latest pop-culture, fantasy or scientific phenomenon of the show’s 1980s setting, Will disappeared during the very first episode, setting the wide-eyed, bowl-cutted boy apart from the group.\n\nDespite his friends rescuing him from the Upside Down at the end of the first season, Will only grew more distinctive as the series continued. As his friends came of age and found girlfriends, he remained outside the group, not only from his traumatic abduction, but from a more elusive feeling of isolation. In Season 3, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) snaps at Will for not liking girls, which further sparked fan speculation regarding the character’s sexuality.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThose speculations seemed to be confirmed, though never explicitly stated, in Season 4 when Will breaks down trying to profess his feelings toward Mike. However, it’s not until Season 5, Episode 7, “The Bridge,” when Will finally admits to his friends— “I don’t like girls.”\n\nThe emotional monologue rounding out the series’ penultimate episode is a powerful, touching and poignant delivery on Will’s highly anticipated coming out. It pays off on Will’s arc toward self-acceptance and assurance. While the character has spent much of the series as the victim, he takes center stage as a hero in Season 5, revealed to have sorcerer-like supernatural abilities in the season’s fourth episode that concluded Volume 1.\n\nThese triumphant moments also demonstrate Schapp’s growth as an actor over his 10 years playing Will. The coming out monologue is Schnapp’s most emotionally intense and verbose in the series. The performance is further accented by Schapp’s real-world relationship to the topic, having publicly come out as gay in 2023.\n\nVariety spoke with Schnapp to unpack the distinguished scene, how he shaped it with series creators Matt and Ross Duffer and director Shawn Levy and his feelings about closing the book on his decade-plus role in “Stranger Things.”\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nAt what point did you find out that Will was going to come out in Season 5, Episode 7?\n\nYou know that it’s coming. This season, we read the first six episodes together, and I was like “OK, it didn’t happen yet, so it’s going to be in Episode 7 or 8,” which hadn’t been written yet. So then from January of filming on through the year, I kept texting the Duffers, “Is it done? Did you write it? Is it in 7 or 8? How are you gonna write it?” Eventually, they said they had it, and I read it by the end of the year in August or September. And I was just in tears. It was perfect.\n\nDid you get the opportunity to workshop the script with the Duffers or with Shawn Levy, who directed “The Bridge” with the Duffers?\n\nI was worried that I might need to, but honestly, it was perfect. I really had no notes about it.\n\nDo you recall your co-stars’ reactions the first time that you rehearsed the scene, or did a table read? Shawn Levy told us that the reactions on camera were genuine.\n\nHonestly, I was so wrapped up in my emotions and what I was feeling that I kind of blocked out everyone around me. I kind of had to because it was so nerve-racking to know that the entire cast was there watching me. I had Winona next to me, and the boys and Maya [Hawke] around me. It was all a blur. I don’t really remember anyone’s reactions, but watching it back, it was nice to see. It did feel genuine.\n\nHow many takes did you do of the scene?\n\nOh my God, it was endless. It was like a 12-hour day of just that monologue. And we weren’t even done after the 12-hour day. We came back a week later to reshoot certain parts of the scene for another 12 hours. It was like, “Oh my God, how many more times can I do this scene?” But it was also nice because it allowed me to try so many different things. I never felt stuck to anything. I got advice from Maya on how to prepare for it, because there were so many lines, more lines than I’d ever had before.\n\n\n\nMaya speaks like a madman so I asked, “How do you learn all these lines and not think about it in the scene?” She said, “It’s not about how well you know it, it’s how long you’ve known it for, so just prep for months before.” So I’d just go through it morning and night every day for months before shooting, but I wouldn’t prep how to say it or how to feel. It would just be plain saying the lines out loud with no emotion, just to sink it in. But then on the day, I was able to explore the feelings and emotions, and it was fun to have those 12 hours to play and feel. The cast was so gracious. I’ll never forget how supportive they were on that day and how respectful and giving they were to me, because they had to sit there through an entire night just hearing me ramble. They were supporting me on all these angles where they weren’t even caught on camera. They could have gone and sat in Video Village or hung out, but they all sat there in their spots through the whole day. It was really special.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nIn those 12 hours of takes, did you film versions of the scene that are different from what ended up in the final cut?\n\nThere were so many different choices in the different takes. I remember being asked, “Do you want to do your close up first or do you want to do it at the end of the day?” Because that was the most important shot. So I could either start with a wide and kind of explore it and feel out the scene and then go to the close up, or go straight into it. I was really struggling with whether I was ready to bang it out first or get comfortable before it. I decided last minute, “Let’s just start with the close up. I’m ready to go and I just want to do it.” And then it was like one of the first takes of the day, and that was most of the meat of the scene. It was so nice because it hadn’t been exhausted yet. It was real and raw and I’m glad I did it that way.\n\nWas there anything that surprised you in the final cut of the scene and the way it was edited?\n\nLiterally for every scene, I’m like “Oh I didn’t expect that.” You don’t realize the power of editing and how it can change a scene. For this scene, it was nice because there were moments where I tried the first paragraph of the monologue to the boys where it was a lot more sad, and then there were times when I was a lot more happy reliving the memories with them. I’m glad that they edited it the way they did, where it’s nice to see him not just sob through the whole scene, but kind of smile through the memories and give that lighter feel. It makes it hit harder.\n\nIt’s interesting that Will says “I don’t like girls” rather than “I’m gay.” How was that wording decided on? Was there fear about being too explicit, or do you think Will is still sort of figuring out his identity?\n\nYeah, I noticed that and I spoke to the Duffers about it specifically. We have to remember that its the 1980s. When I came out, I didn’t say the word “gay.” It’s hard, and it feels scary to say it. In the ’80s, I can’t imagine how much more pressure there was and how much more there was to lose. When Will is first coming to terms with it in front of his friends, he’s probably scared to use that word, but there’s nothing wrong with it. I think he just felt more comfortable phrasing it that way.\n\nDo you think discovering that he’s a sorcerer has given Will the confidence to embrace what makes him different? How has discovering Will’s newfound power changed your approach to the character?\n\nI think it helps him accept himself, and you totally see it from the beginning of the season. He’s kind of more assertive and self-assured. It’s nice to play that side of him, and not just play someone who’s always walked all over. Even with the coming out scene, having that much dialogue and actually getting to express myself through my words, which this character has never really done until then, was so nice.\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nA lot of those scenes you share with Winona Ryder. What was it like working so closely with her this final season after having played her son for almost a decade?\n\nIt was really special. I was kind of sad in Seasons 3 and 4 that I got separated from her, and I really missed working with her. She’s one of my favorite scene partners and people, and it was so nice to be with her for most of this season. I feel so comfortable around her, and it was hard to say goodbye. I didn’t expect to have such trouble letting go of her on that last day. I didn’t want to let her go, and I realized she really became this motherly figure to me at work during these 10 years.\n\nYou also share a lot of scenes with Maya Hawke this Season. How was collaborating with her?\n\nWe definitely got closer. I’d barely spoken to Maya before then. I mean, I don’t even think we were friends. Now, we spent the whole season together, and she’s part of my little “Stranger Things” family.\n\nLastly, you had the ability to collaborate with younger actors this season. For so long, you and the main ensemble were the youngest people on the show. What was it like to now have new rising actors on set who might have looked up to you?\n\nIt definitely helped me realize, “Wow, we’ve come so far. We’re not kids anymore.” They’re looking to us. You always feel like you don’t know anything and you have so much more to learn, but then it makes you realize that we’ve spent 10 years here, and we do have some experience now. It was nice to get to work with them and they were so cute. They just brought this childlike energy that reminded us that we were still kids too. I was making handshakes with them and I felt like I was 12 years old again. It was so fun.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 2 spoilers\n\n• The Duffer Brothers break down all the Volume 1 spoilers\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 05:55:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T06:40:26.768023"}

Ahead of the highly anticipated Season 1 finale &#8216;The Cottage&#8217;, which is [&#8230;]", "content": "SPOILERS: This post contains details about the Heated Rivalry, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nWith the conclusion of Heated Rivalry‘s rookie season, writer/director/creator Jacob Tierney is taking a breath before hitting the ice again with the wildly popular LGBTQ hockey drama series.\n\nAhead of the highly anticipated Season 1 finale ‘The Cottage’, which is now available to stream on Crave and HBO Max, Tierney teased that despite the satisfying closure of the episode, Season 2 and beyond “will always be centered around” Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov’s (Connor Storrie) love story, with author Rachel Reid’s final book in the series, The Long Game, serving as the basis.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“But we have a whole universe here, and so there’s loads of other things that we’re thinking about and that we’re gonna explore and that we’re gonna start to take more seriously now that we know that there’s an audience for it,” explained Tierney, following the show’s Season 2 renewal. “And that’s pretty exciting, so I’m looking forward to really digging into this world.”\n\nTaking LGBTQ and female audiences by storm with its bold depictions of gay sex and romance, Tierney revealed that his favorite intimate scenes were in the finale.\n\n“What I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it’s one thing to just make smut—which I’m thrilled to be doing. No shame in that game,” he said. “But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. Who cares at a certain point? We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers.”\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nTierney added, “That’s why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it’s both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. And I like those two juxtapositions. That’s when I feel like they’re a real couple, like when you’re giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. That’s what a boyfriend does.”\n\nRead on about the Heated Rivalry, Season 1 finale’s sex scenes, why the show’s depiction of LGBTQ fame appealed to him and what’s ahead for Season 2.\n\nDEADLINE: Are you surprised that the show has taken off on this level, outside of Canada?\n\nJACOB TIERNEY: No, this is exactly what I expected—yes, I’m very surprised. We’re all a bit overwhelmed by the reaction to the show. Obviously, it’s very gratifying and it’s very nice, but it’s certainly not anything you can expect, and then coupled with, plan for anything like that. It’s crazy.\n\nDEADLINE: And it was awesome seeing the fan reaction to the Scott [François Arnaud] and Kip [Robbie GK] kiss in the last episode. It was such a good wrap-up for that episode.\n\nTIERNEY: It was very moving to see all those reactions. It was very, very moving for me.\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’ (Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max)\n\nDEADLINE: And now, all of the gays and the girls are super excited for ‘The Cottage’.\n\nTIERNEY: I’m telling you, no Canadian’s that excited.\n\nDEADLINE: Was the pressure on to bring that part of the book to life? Because I’ve seen a lot of people are really anticipating it.\n\nTIERNEY: I mean, I made the show. I didn’t think anybody was gonna care this much. I’m relieved that I made it the way that I did. I mean, there was pressure for me internally to end the show well. And I think that the thing that I was aware of, though it might not seem that way on the surface, it’s a big swing cause it’s a two-hander essentially. To go from an episode like 5, which is so big and epic, into ‘The Cottage’, which is relatively tiny—I think 38 of the 52 minutes are the two of them alone in a cottage. That’s kind of a big structural and narrative swing to pull off, or to attempt, I suppose. But I just wanted to continue to do right by this relationship, these characters, and to give their journey the kind of last push that I thought it needed to successfully finish the book.\n\nDEADLINE: And I really appreciated the scene with Shane’s parents because coming out was obviously such a big fear for him, and just seeing how perfectly they handled it. Tell me about bringing something that gay kids really need to see to the screen like that.\n\nTIERNEY: Yeah, it’s a big part of the book, so I certainly didn’t invent it whole cloth. But yeah, that stuff is very important, and it’s always been an interesting distinction between Shane and Ilya. And I think it’s quite stark when Ilya—it’s a small line that he says in episode 5, but he says that about his father, “I wish he could have known me.” And I think that’s what he means, and I think that Ilya’s very aware. Part of the reason that he’s kind of gently probing Shane in that episode and being like, “Do they know about you?” And he’s like, “No, about you. Who f*cking cares about me? Do they know you? If they don’t, you’ll regret it at a certain point. You need to take this leap.” And it’s scary as those of us who’ve come out to parents [know], which is most gay kids at this point, or queer people in general. It’s very scary and it’s a big deal, but it’s something that’s pretty important in that journey. And what was important to me throughout the show was to make sure that we had sophisticated and complicated relationships with parents going on here. It was why it was so important for me to keep Skip’s dad in the show, to see somebody be supportive like that, to see somebody whose love cup is endless. And I think that to see Yuna [Shane’s mom, played by Christina Chang] is such an important part of this show, and she’s such an important part moving forward, especially. And I think that in these moments, you see that her and Shane are so similar, and they have very similar limitations, and that it was really important to me for the two of them to have a moment together beyond what was already in the book and what was already in the story. It felt very important to me that these two have—I don’t think it’s a reckoning, but that they have their own moment of intimacy where they can clear things up for one another. Because I think they’re both the kinds of people that build things up in their heads, and when you say things out loud, I think you can kind of take the air out of them, and it suddenly becomes a lot more manageable than whatever you’ve created in your brain. And it helps to have two very, very good actors there to do the heavy lifting for me.\n\nChristina Chang as Yuna and Dylan Walsh as David Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’ Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’ (Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max)\n\nDEADLINE: And one thing that’s really tragic, even though it was such a great finale, just the fact that Shane wants to just keep their relationship a secret until they retire. And it kind of struck me how it’s almost like art imitating life, or vice-versa, with the pressure and speculation that the actors are facing. Was that exploration of fame in the back of your head when you were making this?\n\nTIERNEY: I mean, I’ve been an actor my whole life. I know what that’s like. I’ve known loads of actors in the closet. I’ve known loads of actors who have come out. And I do think that part of the reason that this story appealed to me is because I can relate to it. I can understand that pressure, especially when you come up at a young enough age that you don’t know, that you don’t know what an answer to a question like that would be, but you certainly live in a world where you got a lot of people telling you not to talk about it, and that if you want the things you want, you’ll kind of keep toe-ing a line. And I think that’s also part of what makes the story resonate with so many people is that we’re not pretending we live in a world without homophobia, and we’re not pretending we live in a world where coming out is easy. I think that’s part of the beauty of what Scott does is so brave, and it’s so big, and it does crack something open for other people, but I think what it cracks open for them is just allowing them to know that they are allowed to be together. The rest of it, they can figure out at a later date—and the fans of the book know how this is gonna go—but I think that part of what is interesting and different and unique about Shane and Ilya’s story is that this journey that we’re watching them go on in this first book, in this first season of TV now, is a journey to just understanding that they love each other. And that’s such a hurdle for them. That’s hard enough for them, that to then add in the rest of the world, I think will take a whole other season of television. So, that’s kind of part of the journey that will be explored down the road. But I have a lot of empathy and I have a lot of time for Shane’s journey with that stuff. It’s not easy. It’s hard, and I do think that there’s actors, a lot of professionals, especially people who begin their professional journey at 12 years old. There’s so much baked in, and there’s so much built in around you that you can often lose yourself. I think it’s quite easy to do that, and again, I’ve seen it happen with so many actors that I came up with.\n\nDEADLINE: Speaking of which, I just recently discovered that you were in Are You Afraid of the Dark?, which was such a big part of my childhood.\n\nTIERNEY: I am a campfire kid forever.\n\nDEADLINE: I love that. Were there moments on Heated Rivalry where you had to compromise your vision or the story?\n\nTIERNEY: Sure, there were moments along the way … my execs at Crave were so f*cking amazing about that. There were people along the way. But my execs, they didn’t want it toned down at all.\n\nHudson Williams as Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nDEADLINE: Well, it’s great to see such a fearlessly queer show, especially when GLAAD recently released their study that almost half of LGBTQ characters are disappearing. So, it just feels very needed right now, and I love it.\n\nTIERNEY: We added a bunch, so at least there’s that. It’s not a great time for stuff like that, and I think, unfortunately, the more there’s consolidation among broadcasters and streamers too, it’s not gonna get a lot better, I don’t think. But it is nice to be a part of a show that is doing something like this, that’s reminding people that there’s loads of audiences here and that they can be queer and queer adjacent, our allies, our friends, our families. If this was just gay people watching this show, we wouldn’t be talking about it right now, let’s be real. So, the fact that it’s gotten to this level of conversation in the culture is because there are people that want to watch this, and they don’t care if it’s two men in a love story, or maybe even want that specifically. And then even more so, it’s just such a pleasure to be involved in a show that’s making people happy and that is providing joy. I still read people being like, “I know that this show is gonna end on a cliffhanger.” And I keep wanting to shout it from the rooftops, “It won’t! I don’t want to do that to you, that’s not what we’re doing here.”\n\nDEADLINE: Honestly, I had that thought too, watching it. It’s such a good ending, and then they get in the car. I’m like, “Oh, they’re about to get into a car accident or something. I just know it.”\n\nTIERNEY: You know what’s really funny, is that if I let that footage just run and run and run, because we shot that in the studio, my producing partner Brendan [Brady] will run out in front of that car and get hit by it. So you will see our straight producer dying. Does that help? Is that the secret twist that nobody saw coming?\n\nDEADLINE: That’s the one we want.\n\nTIERNEY: There you go. That’s it.\n\nDEADLINE: Another thing I thought was funny, I’m reading a lot of the social media reactions, and you’ve introduced a lot of viewers to frottage.\n\nTIERNEY: Frottage at the cottage, baby!\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nDEADLINE: Yeah, exactly. So that’s cool, it’s really opening a lot of eyes to queer sex. And I’ve also seen some people talk about how very accurate the sex scenes are to the book, and I’m wondering if you were very committed to maintaining accuracy to those scenes.\n\nTIERNEY: Some of them are super accurate to, or close to the book, and some of them go different ways. But what I would say I was committed to, that Rachel and I are both committed to, was kind of using this sex to tell their story, that this is not separate from their story. The sex isn’t like, “And then they fuck! Let’s put it in a new room or do it on a kitchen counter.” Their sex is the way that they understand each other, and it’s the way that we understand them as a couple. So, what I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it’s one thing to just make smut—which I’m thrilled to be doing. No shame in that game. But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. Who cares at a certain point? We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers. You can go watch sex wherever you want to. So, what would have to keep this interesting, is to watch it evolve and to watch their intimacy change. That’s why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it’s both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. And I like those two juxtapositions. That’s when I feel like they’re a real couple, like when you’re giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. That’s what a boyfriend does. That’s annoying. That’s great. That’s what I want to see.\n\nDEADLINE: Another thing I loved, as great as the sex scenes are, I noticed that episode 5, there’s not as many sex scene.\n\nTIERNEY: There’s none.\n\nDEADLINE: But there’s a lot of more emotional intimacy, and it made it feel so earned and real. Like when Ilya tells Shane “I love you” in Russian.\n\nTIERNEY: I think that’s part of the evolution too, it’s a story. It was really important to me that you have to earn these moments. That’s why episode 3 is where it is, and that’s why 5 ends the way it does. This stuff, it has to imprint on you, and then, you get that those big feelings like that. And I don’t think you get those big feelings that you get in 5 if you haven’t sat through how painful 4 was for them, or the ending of 2, where you’re like, “Oh God, will these two ever f*cking learn to talk to each other?” And then when they do in 5, it’s in two different languages. I think that’s also part of what’s amazing when romance works, that you’re just endlessly watching two people bypass each other. When they hit, you’re like, “No, wait! It’s not that.” And that aching. Yeah, it’s been so fun to see people react to that.\n\nConnor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov and Hudson Williams as Shane Hollander in the ‘Heated Rivalry’, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage’\n\nDEADLINE: Where are you at with Season 2, or are you just kind of letting it ruminate?\n\nTIERNEY: It’s all gonna be underwater. It takes place in the lost city of Atlantis—no, listen, Season 2 will be based around The Long Game. I don’t have details. I have not started writing, so I’m not just trying to be evasive. I genuinely don’t know yet. I’m so lucky to have a whole world of books here to grab things from, to use, to add color, to add context, to add story. I can tell you I’m really excited to get back to writing. I’m excited to get back into this world with them, and I’m looking forward to it. I guess, here’s what I can say too, is that Heated Rivalry will always be centered around Shane and Ilya, this show. But we have a whole universe here, and so there’s loads of other things that we’re thinking about and that we’re gonna explore and that we’re gonna start to take more seriously now that we know that there’s an audience for it. And that’s pretty exciting, so I’m looking forward to really digging into this world.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 06:01:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T06:40:27.655201"}

The organization’s new name, after what the White House claimed was a unanimous vote by the board of trustees, is “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Experts say the renaming of the Kennedy Center is illegal.\n\nBut the Kennedy Center is not the current owner of trumpkennedycenter.org or trumpkennedycenter.com — because back in August, comedy writer Toby Morton registered those two domain names, expecting Trump and his allies to add Trump’s name to the D.C. landmark.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“As soon as Trump began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year, I thought, ‘Yep, that name’s going on the building,’” Morton recently told the Washington Post. “The Kennedy Center has always been a cultural institution meant to outlast any one administration or personality. It’s meant to honor culture, not ego. Once it was treated like personal branding, satire became unavoidable.”\n\nSnapping up domain names and using them to troll politicians has been an active pursuit for Morton, who has “South Park” and “Mad TV” writing credits (and once provided the voice of Scott Tenorman, the half-brother and nemesis of Eric Cartman, on “South Park”). Morton, whose bio on BlueSky says he is a “Creator of Anti-Fascist websites,” hasn’t launched websites on trumpkennedycenter.org or trumpkennedycenter.com at this point. But he pledged that when he does, they will “absolutely reflect the absurdity of the moment. Lots of surprises. Some things are truly hard to parody, though.”\n\nVariety has reached out to the Kennedy Center’s press office for comment.\n\nMorton, in a post on BlueSky this week, marveled at supportive comments from readers responding to the Post story. “I’m so used to hate comments that these from the Washington Post article feel downright refreshing. Also, a few longtime heroes of mine are quietly on board now, which helps. PRO TIP: Maybe don’t mess with an institution like The Kennedy Center? The support is growing. Watch this space.”\n\nPer the Washington Post, Morton operates about 50 political parody sites. Those mtg2026.org, which lampoons Rep.

This actress, still resplendent, emerges onstage and receives a round of applause, a bit of homage from an audience that knew her years before, and is waiting to see what she can do now — how time has changed her. To this point, we’ve seen her deny her ambitions, as well as her lust for the film’s title character: She’s too composed to give herself away. Now, though, the audience cannot see her face as she turns her back on them, but the camera follows her and so we can. She has burst into the gladdest grin, remembering, all at once, what the attention of the crowd felt like.\n\nThe performer is Kay Stone, a fictional mid-century star who’s receded into private life. And the performer playing her is Gwyneth Paltrow, whose very public life has, for years now, not made room for acting. To see Paltrow at work is to be reminded of what a vital and urgent screen presence she is, how alive she manages to be in every moment and how adept she is at showing the way her characters hide that vividity behind shades of cool. It’s also to be aware that perhaps Paltrow needed the time away to conjure a performance quite this majestic.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPaltrow made no secret of her ambivalence about acting after becoming a mother; her business interests, in the form of her Goop suite of media entities and products (kicked off with a newsletter in 2008), have allowed her to more proactively define her brand, and what roles she’s held on to have plainly not been that exciting anyhow. (She practically seems to delight in going viral when, in various on-camera interviews, she can’t remember appearing in various Marvel films.) Many actresses, past 40, find opportunities drying up. As if to pre-empt the question, Paltrow stepped away from the set and found opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThat choice compels us in other ways. Many people who are not inherently interested in wellness culture, or in self-help jargon, or in a woo-woo redefinition of the concept of “divorce” as “conscious uncoupling,” got on board the Goop train, at least as gawkers. I reserve judgment on whether the ideas Goop puts forward are valid. They’re interesting to the onlooker because the figure speaking about them has that Paltrovian assurance and composure.\n\nBut while Paltrow has been making her way in the world of business, something’s been missing on-screen. The passionate anger thrumming under Margot Tenenbaum’s seen-it-all glare in “The Royal Tenenbaums”; the lust for life Viola de Lesseps must tamp down under boy drag in “Shakespeare in Love”; the slowly dawning repulsion Marge Sher- wood struggles to hide in “The Talented Mr. Ripley”: Those weren’t flukes. They were proof of Paltrow’s particular interest in playing with the concept of concealment, of showing us just how hot her blood can run under the hauteur. The defining pre-Goop image of Paltrow in the public imagination is of her facade breaking while accepting an Oscar. Done up in princessy Ralph Lauren, she openly, loudly wept: The passion underlying the pink couture is what she’s shown us in movies too.\n\nThat’s also at work in “Marty Supreme,” and perhaps it’s no wonder the script appealed to Paltrow. By contrast to the frosty but secretly yearning Kay Stone, Timothée Chalamet’s Marty Mauser is all bravado, pushing his career as a table-tennis player forward through his insistence that he is destined for the pantheon. (Marty, too, makes for a metatextual meal for the actor playing him — Chalamet is as un-shy about his ambition for himself as any star currently working.)\n\nTheir pairing is one of opposites: Marty seems, for much of the film, resistant to the idea of an inner life. Life, for him, is meant to be lived aloud. Kay, though, has been seasoned enough by the Hollywood system and life’s disappointments to know just how much of herself to keep in reserve. And so when Paltrow lets loose and shows us the flare of uncontrollable emotion undergirding Kay’s careful control, we who have missed this talent of hers are powerless to do anything but mirror the audience on-screen, and let out a cheer.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T15:27:33.332177"}

Welcome to 2025 at the multiplexes!\n\nIt was a roller-coaster year at cinemas and for the studios tasked with keeping their screens filled. Warner Bros. enjoyed an epic run at the box office, fielding hits as diverse as a vampire flick set in the Jim Crow South (“Sinners”), an old-school star-driven racing drama (“F1: The Movie”) and a sandbox-game-turned-big-screen-smash (“A Minecraft Movie”). Meanwhile Paramount, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars on yet another “Mission: Impossible,” barely released anything that turned a profit.\n\nAnd then there’s Disney, which backed three movies that topped $1 billion (we’re assuming that will be the case with “Avatar: Fire and Ash”) and stands out as the only studio to cross a combined $6 billion globally, but also distributed nearly twice as many big-budget duds (“Elio,” “Snow White” and “Tron: Ares,” to name a few). More troubling, Marvel, once Hollywood’s biggest hitmaker, struggled to regain its mojo. It’s all coming down to next year’s “Avengers: Doomsday” to get the franchise back on course.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOur annual report card includes the five major studios as well as A24, which is nominally an indie, but spent lavishly on “The Smashing Machine” and “Marty Supreme.” But it doesn’t include streamers such as Amazon and Apple, which didn’t release enough movies in cinemas for us to judge their slate. Come on, guys, start spending those Bezos bucks!\n\nAs 2025 draws to a close, it’s time for Hollywood to get its report card. Some of you may not want to hang it on your fridge.\n\nDisney\n\nHighs: “Lilo & Stitch” ($1.03 billion against a $100 million budget), “Zootopia 2” ($1.31 billion against a $150 million budget), “Freakier Friday” ($153 million against a $42 million budget), “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($506 million and counting against a $250 million+ budget)\n\nLows: “Captain America: Brave New World” ($415 million against a $180 million budget), “Snow White” ($205 million against a $250 million budget), “Elio” ($154 million against a $150 million budget) “Tron: Ares” ($142 million against a $180 million budget), “Predator: Badlands” ($181 million against a $105 million budget), “Ella McCay” ($4 million against a $35 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: Disney deserves props for fielding two (and likely three after “Avatar: Fire and Ash” gets through the holiday season) billion-dollar hits, a feat that illuminates the chasm between the studio and its rivals, none of whom had a single film cross $1 billion since 2023. Yet almost nothing else worked for Disney beyond the live-action “Lilo & Stitch” remake, “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar 3.” Marvel continued its lousy streak, producing three consecutive commercial duds in “Captain America: Brave New World,” “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” (Next year’s Sony-produced “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and “Avengers: Doomsday” can’t arrive soon enough.) “Elio” underscored Pixar‘s continued struggle to launch original animation. Meanwhile, “Snow White,” “Tron: Ares” and “Predator: Badlands” proved that some aging properties are better left in the vault. That’s a problem for Disney, which relies almost entirely on recycling what’s worked in the past. Let it be a mantra for Hollywood: Brand recognition doesn’t equal box office dollars.\n\nGrade: B\n\nParamount\n\nHighs: “Smurfs” ($124 million against a $58 million budget), “The Naked Gun” ($102 million against a $42 million budget), “Regretting You” ($90.4 million against a $30 million budget)\n\nLows: “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” ($598 million against a $400 million budget), “Roofman” ($33 million against a $20 million budget), “The Running Man” ($68 million against a $105 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: In its defense, Paramount spent most of the past year stuck in a painful limbo as it waited for government regulators to approve its sale to Skydance. That left studio executives — many of whom correctly deduced they’d be shown the exit as soon as David Ellison’s crew took over — punching the clock. Paramount did write a blank check to Tom Cruise, only to find that he had embarked on one impossible mission too many. It also gambled that Edgar Wright and Glen Powell could crack “The Running Man,” the second adaptation of the Stephen King novel; the first attempt flopped when it hit theaters with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sadly, the pair shouldn’t have bothered lacing up their sneakers. Paramount fielded a few cost-effective hits, like “Smurfs” and “The Naked Gun,” but these are not the kind of modest successes one expects from one of Hollywood’s most storied studios. Will the new management fare better?\n\nGrade: C\n\nSony\n\nHighs: “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” ($664 million against a $20 million budget), “Chainsaw Man” ($153 million), “One of Them Days” ($51 million against a $14 million budget), “Karate Kid: Legend” ($117 million against a 45 million budget), “28 Years Later” ($151 million against a $60 million budget), “I Know What You Did Last Summer” ($64.8 million against an $18 million budget), “Materialists” ($71 million at the international box office)\n\nLows: “Caught Stealing” ($32 million against a $40 million budget), “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” ($20 million against a $45 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: Sony didn’t have any home runs, but it also avoided any strikeouts. It wasn’t a terribly strong year for the studio, to be sure. But we’re grading based on what’s been released and not what could have been. Anime was a massive boon, with Crunchyroll’s “Demon Slayer” and “Chainsaw Man” scoring back-to-back wins while demonstrating a voracious appetite for manga adaptations in the U.S. The studio also kept the theatrical comedy alive with the Keke Palmer and SZA-led “One of Them Days,” and turned A24’s romantic drama “Materialists” into an international hit. Neither “Karate Kid: Legend” nor “I Know What You Did Last Summer” were necessary sequels, but both films scraped together modest grosses. As for “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” the collective wattage of Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell couldn’t overcompensate for terrible reviews and bad buzz. Star power only gets audiences to theaters if the movie is, ya know, good.\n\nGrade: B\n\nUniversal\n\nHighs: “How to Train Your Dragon” ($636 million against a $150 million budget), “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($868 million against a $180 million budget), “Black Phone 2” ($132 million against a $30 million budget), “Wicked: For Good” ($488 million and counting against a $150 million budget), “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” ($206 million against a $36 million budget)\n\nLows: “Wolf Man” ($34 million against a $25 million budget), “Love Hurts” ($17 million against a $18 million budget), “M3GAN 2.0” ($39 million against a $25 million budget), “Him” ($28 million against a $27 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: Sequels and reboots delivered in a big way for Donna Langley and her team. On paper, rebooting “Jurassic World” a mere three years after the last installment in the “when dinosaurs attack” franchise might have seemed like a bad idea. But it turns out people really like watching velociraptors dine out on some pesky humans, especially when Scarlett Johansson is trying to avoid becoming dessert. The studio also scored with follow-ups to “Wicked” and “Five Nights at Freddy’s” that won’t do anywhere near the same business as their predecessors but should turn a tidy profit. There were flops, of course. But failures like “Wolf Man” and “M3GAN 2.0” didn’t cost much to produce. The main issue that Universal faced is that Blumhouse, which made both those films, was uncharacteristically inconsistent. “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” and “Black Phone 2” helped the company get back on track, but it needs to deliver new franchises instead of just servicing old ones.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nHighs: “A Minecraft Movie” ($958 million against a $150 million budget), “Sinners” ($367 million against a $90 million budget), “Final Destination Bloodlines” ($315 million against a $50 million budget), “F1: The Movie” ($631 million against a $250 million+ budget fronted by Apple), “Superman” ($616 million against a $224 million budget), “Weapons” ($268 million a $38 million budget)\n\nLows: “Mickey 17” ($133 million against a $118 million budget), “The Alto Knights” ($10 million against a $50 million budget), “One Battle After Another” ($204 million against a $140 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: It’s the comeback of the year. After a rough end to 2024 (“Joker: Folie à Deux,” anyone?) and a rocky start to 2025 (“Mickey 17” and “The Alto Knights” were pricey bombs), the studio rebounded the old-fashioned way — by banking on bold directors and new ideas at a time when reboots and sequels reign supreme. Seven consecutive releases, from video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie” and Ryan Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners” to the Brad Pitt-led sports drama “F1: The Movie” and Zach Cregger’s genre-bending mystery “Weapons,” opened above $40 million domestically, a first in Hollywood history. Although Paul Thomas Anderson’s comedic adventure “One Battle After Another” isn’t in danger of turning a profit against its hefty $140 million budget, the film surpassed the $200 million mark and achieved a milestone by getting adult audiences to theaters for original fare. Plus, “One Battle” could be valuable beyond the balance sheet as a major Oscar contender. This might be Warner Bros.’ last year as a stand-alone studio. If that’s the case, it went out with a bang.\n\nGrade: A\n\nA24\n\nHighs: “Materialists ($104 million against an $18 million budget), “Bring Her Back” ($39 million against a $10 million budget), “Friendship” ($16.5 million after being acquired for $3 million), “Eternity” ($28 million against a $12 million budget)\n\nLows: “The Smashing Machine” ($21 million against a $50 million budget), “Eddington” ($13 million against a $25 million budget), “The Legend of Ochi” ($4.9 million against a $10 million budget), “Warfare” ($33 million against a $20 million budget), “Death of a Unicorn” ($15 million against a $15 million budget)\n\nTakeaways: The indie studio is trying to play with the big boys by moving beyond its low-budget roots. But it found out the hard way that spending more money doesn’t always result in bigger profits. Benny Safdie’s “The Smashing Machine,” featuring a change-of-pace performance by Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson as a troubled MMA fighter, was too dark for the actor’s fans and failed to earn the critical acclaim it needed to pack in art-house audiences. Oh, and it cost $50 million to produce and millions more to market, making it one of the year’s bigger bombs. The same was true of Ari Aster’s “Eddington,” a political satire set during COVID that discovered that most moviegoers would rather memory-hole the pandemic. A24 did score with “Materialists,” a starry rom-com from Celine Song that became a true mainstream hit. And it has a chance to end things on a high note with “Marty Supreme,” a table-tennis drama starring one-man hype machine Timothée Chalamet. If it scores, A24 deserves some extra credit.\n\nGrade: B-", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T15:45:52.625245"}

But for now, we’ve got a lot of questions.\n\nDuring the Christmas Day release of Volume 2 of “Stranger Things 5,” many key plot points were fleshed, and we received a lot of information heading into the series finale, dropping on Dec. 31. We learned things we never knew — like, that Eleven’s powers come from Henry’s blood, as transfused by Dr. Brenner, and that the Upside Down isn’t its own dimension, but instead is a wormhole connecting our world and Vecna’s, which Dustin has named the Abyss.\n\nAs we process “Shock Jock,” “Escape from Camazotz” and “The Bridge,” the latest “Stranger Things” episodes, we’ve rounded up the biggest burning questions ahead of the finale.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBIG QUESTION: What is the ultimate importance of Nov. 6?\n\nIt’s the night Will Byers went missing in the series premiere in 2016, and it’s the night Vecna wants to enact his plan to use the children he’s kidnapped to bring the Abyss and Earth together — but why on this date? What was the significance in the first place that led Vecna to take Will?\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nAND, why does Vecna want to bring the Abyss and Earth together?\n\nIs he just a nihilist who wants to burn it all down at this point? Or is something else going on?\n\n\n\nSOMETHING WE’D LOVE TO KNOW: How did Hopper, El and Kali get out of the Upside Down?\n\n\n\nThe Upside Down was in chaos, falling apart at the seams, and Nancy, Jonathan, Steve and Dustin were still stuck down there — but Hopper, El and Kali managed to get out off-screen. By the start of Episode 7, Hopper and the girls are back in Hawkins, but we don’t see how they managed to get out amid the chaos after Nancy shot a hole in the exotic matter barrier. What did they do to get back out?\n\nWHILE WE’RE AT IT: What blocked the Demogorgon from getting into the elevator to get Max and Lucas?\n\nThat Demo was coming right at them and when it jumped, something prevented it from getting through. And Karen Wheeler could only do so much in a day to save the kids, so what else was going on there?\n\nBIG QUESTION: What stopped the white goo from spreading in the Upside Down?\n\nNancy and Jonathan were saved from certain death in the Upside Down when the world stopped melting into white goo around them, and hardened enough that they could walk on it. While this happened just in time to keep the two alive — but not their relationship — it’s not clear what caused it all to stop and stabilize, as the Upside Down is still seemingly compromised after Nancy shot through the barrier.\n\nSOMETHING WE’D LOVE TO KNOW: Also, what happened to the ring?\n\nNo, it’s not that important, but it was flung on the floor and ultimately, it was what showed them that everything had hardened so… did someone pick it up?\n\nBIG QUESTION: Who is the man young Henry finds with the briefcase down in that mine shaft in the Nevada desert?\n\nFans who have seen the Broadway play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” will have a leg up on what is going on here, but it’s still largely a mystery. We know Henry had a traumatic experience in the desert as a child, after which he was never the same. “First Shadow” reveals Henry entered an alternate dimension, known as Dimension X, and returned after 12 hours with altered blood, a changed personality and psychokinetic powers. Who is the stranger Henry came across, what was he holding onto — and what exactly happened to Henry to make him into this darker person?\n\nBIG QUESTION: What is the connection between Dimension X, the Abyss and the Upside Down?\n\nWe now know the Upside Down is a wormhole that connects Earth to this other world Vecna inhabits, the Abyss. Vecna was banished to the Abyss at Hawkins Lab by El back when he was Henry/One. Despite their shared mistreatment from Brenner, El refused to join Henry in his plans for world domination and ripped a hole in reality that pushed him through to the Abyss. And Brenner, the other scientists and the military put up the exotic-matter barrier that stabilizes the Upside Down and separates the wormhole that goes between the Abyss and Earth from nothingness. And are the Abyss and Dimension X the same thing?\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nBIG QUESTION: Will Eleven sacrifice herself?\n\nAt the end of Episode 7, Kali told El that, for everyone’s benefit, they should kill themselves after defeating Vecna. It’s a sacrifice, Kali says, the two need to make so that the military cannot use their blood to try to create new kids like them, ending the cycle that began when Brenner gave Henry’s blood to pregnant women to create El, Kali and the other telekinetic kids at Hawkins Lab. But will El actually go through with that?\n\nBIG QUESTION: Will any main characters die in the finale?\n\nIn Episode 5, El got very angry with Hopper for having revealed that he would have tried to fight Vecna alone, and for wearing the suicide vest as a failsafe. But now she’s hiding her own secrets — from Hopper, and from everyone — about Kali’s plan. If Eleven does somehow make it out alive, doesn’t someone have to die, even if Matt Duffer told Variety that the show “is not Game of Thrones'”? (And will it be Hopper, in some incredibly noble way?)\n\nALSO: Is Will going to reveal his feelings to Mike?\n\nWill came out in Episode 7, and was embraced by support and love from his friends and family members. And he seems to accept himself for who he is, and, on Robin’s advice, not to rely on reciprocated feelings from someone to feel validated. But does that mean Will won’t have a more direct conversation with Mike about his crush before the end of the series? And if he does, how will Mike react to it? (Also, not that Mike understood this slight, but was it kind of mean for him to refer to Mike as his Tammy?)\n\nBIG QUESTION: How much will Max be able to get inside Henry’s head?\n\nAfter Max died and was brought back to life in the Season 4 finale, her physical body was in a Hawkins hospital — but her mind was in the Abyss with Henry, in Vecna’s mindspace. As Max makes it clear to Holly, she’s spent the past 18 months exploring that terrain as she successfully hid from him. She knows he’s afraid of the cave, and that he has vulnerabilities. As they gear up for their final battle with Vecna, Max tells Eleven to call upon her so they can use that knowledge against him.\n\nAND FINALLY: Will Nancy and Steve end up together?\n\nLet’s end with some silliness. Now that Nancy and Jonathan have called it quits, does this pave the way for Steve to get his dream of having a bunch of little nuggets with his ex?

The images are what Snyder showed to Warner Bros. executives when he was trying to cast Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman in his new DC Universe, which was kicking off with 2013’s “Man of Steel.”\n\n“Henry Cavill. The original Superman suit. This photo. It was undeniable,” Snyder wrote in one caption, while adding in another: “With the last image I shared, and this one, we showed WB [and] everyone agreed: Henry Cavill was Superman. That’s where the journey began.”\n\nCavill played Superman across three movies in Snyder’s DC Universe: “Man of Steel,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Justice League.” Then things got complicated. After a five-year hiatus that left fans wondering about Cavill’s Superman future, he popped up as the Man of Steel in the post-credits scene of 2022’s “Black Adam.” Cavill’s reappearance coincided with reports that a standalone Superman sequel for him was finally in development with the studio soliciting pitches from writers. The post-credits scene teased the DC Universe would then be heading towards a battle between Cavill’s Superman and Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I am back as Superman,” Cavill wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “Thank you for your support and thank you for your patience. I promise it will be rewarded.”\n\nTwo days later, Cavill spoke publicly for the first time about his Superman return during a live recording of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast at 92NY in New York City and said: “There is such a bright future ahead for the character. I’m so excited to tell a story with an enormously joyful Superman.”\n\nCavill’s return was not long for this world, however. Just a day after the announcement, news broke that James Gunn and Peter Safran were taking over DC Studios and launching a new DC Universe. This would effectively end Snyder’s DC Universe, in which Cavill had been front and center. Gunn said on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast earlier this year that an “unfair” situation was created when his deal to take over DC Studios closed just as Cavill was announcing his return. Gunn had planned on rebooting Superman from the start, which he successfully did this summer with his David Corenswet-starring “Superman.”\n\n“The day our [DC] deal closed, all of a sudden, they were announcing that Henry was back,” Gunn said. “And I’m like, ‘What is going on?’ We know what the plan is. The plan was to come in and do ‘Superman.’ So it was really unfair to him and a total bummer… “That was really unfortunate. So Peter and I [thought] the right thing to do was to sit down with [Cavill] and talk to him. And we sat down and we talked to him. He was an absolute gentleman, a great guy about it. He said, ‘The only thing I ask is that I’m able to reveal it myself as opposed to it coming from you guys.’”\n\nThrough all of the presumable drama, Gunn and Snyder stayed in touch. Gunn revealed on X shortly after taking over DC Studios that he had touched base with Snyder and there were no hard feelings between them. Gunn told Fandango earlier this yea that he even consulted with Snyder when it came to designing the new Superman suit and whether or not to add the red trunks.\n\n“One of the biggest questions was, ‘Were we gonna have trunks, or were we gonna not have trunks?’” Gunn said. “I talked to Zack Snyder, who was like, ‘I tried a billion different versions with the trunks, and at the end of the day, I tried it, but I just couldn’t get there.’ And I was feeling exactly the same way. … Theoretically, I liked the idea of trunks because it’s the Superman I grew up with.”\n\nGunn’s DC Universe continues in summer 2026 with “Supergirl” and then the “Superman” sequel film “Man of Tomorrow.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:23:18 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:25:02.868607"}

In comparison, “Avatar: The Way of Water” made $29 million on Christmas Day in 2022, though the holiday fell on a Sunday, and $90 million over its four-day frame. Even though it’s behind Cameron’s previous film, the sci-fi threequel “Fire and Ash” should have a strong hold through the end of the year to offset its large budget.

Full of shocking twists and turns and gruesome violence, which are par for the course with all of Coben’s works, the show is an entertaining maze from its opening scene until the close. “Run Away” reminds audiences that one secret is typically just the tip of the iceberg; as you begin to dig into it, more mysteries often reveal themselves.\n\n​\n\nSet in the U.K., “Run Away” follows financier Simon Greene (James Nesbitt), whose life appears picturesque on the surface. He’s happily married to his pediatrician wife, Ingrid (Minnie Driver), and he has three lovely children, Paige (Ellie de Lange), Sam (Adrian Greensmith) and Anya (Ellie Henry). Unfortunately, the Greene household is in disarray. Sam and Anya are thriving at university and high school, respectively, but Paige has gone missing. After a troubling start in college and becomin g dependent on drugs, she has now disappeared completely. While Ingrid insists on letting their eldest child hit rock bottom, Simon is driven to bring her home.\n\n​\n\nWith his tenacity and a wealth of financial resources, Simon discovers Paige’s whereabouts after six months of no contact. Unfortunately, the father/daughter reunion turns sour quickly, as Simon violently pummels Paige’s volatile boyfriend, Aaron Corval (Thomas Flynn), in front of a park full of spectators. When Aaron is found slaughtered a short time later, Simon becomes the prime suspect for Detectives Isaac Fagbenle (Alfred Enoch) and Ruby Todd (Amy Gledhill). Desperate to clear his name and find Paige again, Simon joins forces with private investigator Elena Ravenscroft (Ruth Jones), who connects Paige to a separate missing person’s case she has been hired to work on.\n\n​\n\nFans of Coben’s frequent adaptations, including Netflix’s “Fool Me Once,” “Missing You,” and “The Stranger,” know his series are tapestries of riddles, and “Run Away” is no different. The mystery around Paige’s disappearance stands at the center of this story, yet it is only one component of the tale. Shocking revelations, horrifying cruelty and complex lies engulf the narrative itself, even when it leans toward the preposterous. Still, the stellar cast, taut pacing and inventive storylines keep the show engaging, even when it could’ve very well fallen apart.\n\n​\n\nFrom the Greene family to Elena’s personal life and the biases of Inspector Fagbenle, there is a wealth of information embedded in the series. However, what’s most compelling, as is the theme in many of Coben’s works, is how little we really know about our loved ones. As human beings, we all have secrets, things we’ve tried to forget or instances we’re ashamed of. These are fragments of our beings we are scared to confess, for they could alter how others perceive us or how we see ourselves. “Run Away” does an exquisite job at honing in on why we choose to bury traumas and destructive behaviors, both past and present.\n\n​\n\nFascinating and intensely detailed, “Run Away” is an astonishing web involving an array of seemingly unrelated characters and circumstances that all weave themselves together in the end. The show puts a spotlight on the secrets we keep from those we love most, and how, once exposed, those skeletons can alter who we are and how we view our loved ones forever. Amid the vast array of clues that slowly reveal themselves, to shootouts and haunting flashbacks, the show is as expansive as it is intense. Moreover, just as viewers believe they’ve grasped the truth, the plot shifts, moving the narrative into a different direction. In the end, the series reminds us that digging into other people’s lives may bring you answers, but you may not want to face these truths when they come to light.\n\n“Run Away” premieres on Netflix Jan. 1.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:00:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:25:03.986340"}

We even broke news about one of them this year. That got us thinking about buzzy projects down the years that were made but still haven’t seen the light of day.\n\nCheck out our piece below on 18 such projects, all starry features that were largely shot, but sadly haven’t had a release for one reason or another.\n\nA Woman of the Sea\n\nA Woman of the Sea, also known by its working title Sea Gulls, is the unreleased silent film produced in 1926 by Charlie Chaplin. The love story set against the sea was a starring vehicle for his former leading lady Edna Purviance. But it is one of only two lost Chaplin films, having been destroyed by Chaplin himself as a tax write-off, despite six months of filming and an estimated $90,000 spent on production. Filmmaker John Grierson, who reportedly saw some of the film before the negatives were burned, called it “extraordinarily beautiful — but empty.”\n\nThe Deep\n\nOrson Welles worked on this film from 1966-1969 and still harbored hopes it might be completed in the years after that. The drama was to follow a couple’s honeymoon trip aboard a yacht. The production was plagued by financial and technical problems and as work on the film became more sporadic and difficult, Welles is said to have become increasingly withdrawn. The original negative was lost and the film only exists in two work prints. Despite its challenges, lead Jeanne Moreau was among those to look back on the production as “a fantastic experience,” adding that “the only disastrous thing was that later on, the film disappeared.” Another lead actor in the film, Laurence Harvey, died in 1973, effectively ending hopes the project could film its last remaining scenes.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe Day The Clown Cried\n\nJerry Lewis in ‘The Day the Clown Cried’ Everett Collection\n\nThis 1972 Swedish-French drama, directed by and starring Jerry Lewis, was about a circus clown imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. The film has gained notoriety and mystique over the decades both for its controversial premise and because it never saw the light of day. Lewis repeatedly insisted the film would never be released, but later donated an incomplete copy to the Library of Congress in 2015 under orders that it wasn’t to be made available until 2024. A journalist screened the five-hour footage that year but said that the film wasn’t complete. It later emerged that a complete copy had existed but was stolen by an actor in the film.\n\nBig Bug Man\n\nThis unreleased American animated TV film starred Brendan Fraser and Marlon Brando, marking the latter’s last film role. It followed a candy company worker who gains special abilities after being bitten by insects. The hand-drawn film is reported to have cost as much as $20 million. Pic was written by Bob Bendetson, who also wrote episodes of The Simpsons, and was directed Bendetson and Peter Shin. Brando was originally asked to voice a male character, but Brando thought it would be fun to voice the old lady Mrs. Sour instead. Brando reportedly wore a blonde wig, a dress, white gloves, and full makeup while recording the voice. An unwell Brando died shortly after recording his part in the film. It was originally scheduled for release between 2006 and 2008, but never got a release.\n\nHippie Hippie Shake\n\nHippie Hippie Shake is an unreleased UK drama from Working Title chronicling the release of an Australian satirical magazine in 1960s London and the staff’s trial for distributing an obscene issue. Cillian Murphy and Sienna Miller starred in the film, which was repeatedly delayed. In 2007 the film finally began shooting, but by 2009 creative differences led to director Beeban Kidron quitting during post. By 2011, Working Title admitted the film wouldn’t be released.\n\nBlack Water Transit\n\nBlack Water Transit is an unreleased 2009 American crime-drama directed by Tony Kaye of American History X fame. Laurence Fishburne and Karl Urban are among cast of the film set in post-Katrina New Orleans, where a shipping exec finds himself getting more than he bargained for after agreeing to help feds expose a smuggler. The film got bogged down in various complex lawsuits over many years. Along the way, exec producer David Bergstein went to prison for a separate fraud charge.\n\nThe Magic 7\n\nThe Magic 7 is an animated TV film written and directed by Roger Holzberg. The film centers on the adventures of two children and a dragon as they fight the arch-enemies of Earth. The stellar voice cast included John Candy, Michael J Fox, Ted Danson, Ice-T, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore and James Earl Jones. It was slated to air on Earth Day, April 22, 1997, but was postponed. After later plans for a 2005 release, the film was again suspended.\n\nGore\n\nBased on Jay Parini’s biography of Gore Vidal, the 2017-shot film was in post-production when Netflix decided to cancel it following the sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey. It would have been an early prestige Netflix original and came on the heels of the streamer’s hit collaboration with Oscar winner Spacey on House of Cards. But the film was killed in post. There’s speculation online that the largely finished film privately screened for one or two top-ranking Netflix executives at the time.\n\nLeslie Grace as Batgirl Warner Bros Discovery\n\nThe DC Comics adaptation is possibly the highest-profile instance of an unreleased movie. Directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film starred Leslie Grace as Batgirl alongside JK Simmons, Jacob Scipio, Brendan Fraser, Michael Keaton and Ivory Aquino. Joss Whedon was originally attached to write and direct but left a year into work on the movie. El Arbi and Fallah were hired to direct in 2021 when the film was confirmed as an HBO Max original. In summer 2022, DC Films and WBD announced that, while the film had entered post-production, the studio no longer planned to release it as scheduled due to the company’s cost-cutting measures and a refocus on theatrical releases. The shelving of a nearly complete, $90 million film for tax write-off purposes drew widespread condemnation, but it wasn’t the last time a studio pulled such a move.\n\nScoob 2\n\nThis HBO Max mystery-comedy, scheduled for release in 2022, was a prequel to the studio’s 2020 film Scoob!, both based on the Scooby-Doo franchise. Mark Hamill, McKenna Grace and Maya Hawke were among cast but WBD shelved the film citing cost-cutting measures and an intent to refocus on theatrical films over projects made for streaming.\n\nNewborn/Solitary\n\nThis Nate Parker drama, shot back in 2020, follows a man who is released into a newly self-isolating society after years of solitary confinement. David Oyelowo is in the lead role and support comes from Barry Pepper, Olivia Washington and Jimmie Fails. Parker’s career hit major turbulence some years before this movie was shot and the film’s financier Bron has subsequently gone under, making a release even harder. We hear from sources that there may still be hope of a release for this one, however. Watch this space.\n\nThe Way of the Wind\n\n‘The Way of the Wind’\n\nFew films have been shrouded in more mystery over the years than Terrence Malick‘s The Way of the Wind, a perennial entrant on our list of movies that could appear at major festivals. Malick drew a typically stacked cast for his retelling of Jesus’ life including Mark Rylance, Matthias Schoenaerts, Aidan Turner, Ben Kingsley, Joseph Fiennes, Tawfeek Barhom, Matthieu Kassovitz and Douglas Booth. Rylance is said to play Satan and some in the cast play Saints. The film is understood to have shot in 2019. Kassovitz told French media that Malick filmed an average of five hours per day, leading to 3,000 hours of footage by the end of filming. As of 2025, Malick is reportedly still editing, so there’s hope we may still see this one.\n\nAs we revealed, the conspiracy thriller directed by Mark Pellington and starring Bryan Cranston, Lily Gladstone, Jennifer Ehle and others, shot early this year but came to an abrupt halt when the money ran out and cast and crew stopped being paid. Cranston told us he wouldn’t return to set until the crew got their money, but so far, the project remains in limbo.\n\nKung Fury 2\n\nThis martial arts comedy sequel, directed by David Sandberg, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Tyler Burton Smith, features a starry cast of Sandberg, Michael Fassbender, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Alexandra Shipp, Jorma Tacone and David Hasselhoff. Filming took place in 2019 but wok on post stopped in late 2020 due to a lawsuit with investors, and the film’s release was indefinitely delayed. As of December 2025, the film remains incomplete, with legal issues still ongoing.\n\nAll Starr Weekend\n\nThis all-star sports comedy-drama, written and directed by Jamie Foxx, marked his directorial debut. Foxx also acted in the film with Jeremy Piven, Eva Longoria, Robert Downey Jr, Ken Jeong, Gerard Butler, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Szohr and others. The premise is said to be about two truck drivers who get tickets to see their favorite players in the NBA All-Star Game. After many twists and turns, the guys find themselves and their NBA heroes in a precarious life-or-death situation. Filming began in 2016. Foxx previously said he would portray a “white, racist cop” and “managed to convince Robert Downey Jr. to play a Mexican” in the film. The project was originally scheduled for release in 2018 but was delayed multiple times. By 2022, it was shelved.\n\nThe Long Home\n\nJames Franco directed and stars in this indie drama alongside Josh Hutcherson, Tim Blake Nelson, Courtney Love, Ashton Kutcher, Josh Hartnett and Giancarlo Esposito. Filming began in May 2015 and the film went through post, but after an actress on the film accused Franco of inappropriate sexual behavior it has never been released.\n\nThe Mothership\n\nHalle Berry in ‘The Mothership’ YouTube screenshot\n\nThe Mothership, another unreleased Netflix project, is a sci-fi starring Halle Berry, Molly Parker and Omari Hardwick. The synopsis for Matt Charman’s directorial debut reads: “One year after her husband mysteriously vanishes from their rural farm, single mother Sara Morse and her children discover a strange, extraterrestrial object underneath their home, which leads them to embark on a race to find their husband and father.” Filming wrapped in 2021, but by 2024 Netflix announced it no longer planned to release the film due to the lengthy post-production and said it was never completed. Netflix content chief Bela Bajaria would later say of the film’s canceled release: “Everybody just felt like it was the right thing to not do it.”\n\nGolden\n\nMichel Gondry’s musical, shot in 2024, was said to be inspired by Pharrell Williams’ childhood in Virginia Beach, with Williams on board to write original songs for the film. Kelvin Harrison, Halley Bailey, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Janelle Monae and Brian Tyree Henry were among the starry cast of the ambitious project, which was initially slated to be released in the U.S. by Universal in May 2025. In February, it was reported that due to producer disagreements the $20M+ film would be permanently shelved and not offered to other studios for completion and/or distribution.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:15:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:25:04.322481"}

The adorable videos were discovered by rabid “Heated Rivalry” fans shortly after Storrie became an instant star when the first two episodes of the queer hockey romance series premiered on HBO Max just a month ago.\n\n“He was on to something,” Storrie says looking back at his pre-teen self. “He got me here. He was part of it.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhat would 25-year-old Storrie say to his younger self now? “I would say, ‘Cut that damn hair,’” he cracks, before pausing to give it a think. “I would tell him to make more stuff sooner, make more of his own stuff sooner. Just be more diligent about not just being an actor, as in trying to get cast in something and waiting for opportunities. I would be like, ‘Try putting yourself in your own things.’”\n\nStorrie continues, “I love that little guy. I love him. I used to not like him.”\n\nIt wasn’t easy for a kid like him growing up in Odessa, Texas.\n\n“I was this artist, sissy boy in West Texas that didn’t want to play football,” he explains. “I wanted to play pretend and play dress up and disappear into weird worlds and entertain and try to connect with people that way, and that was just not the norm out there.”\n\nThat kid is now one of Hollywood’s hottest young talents.\n\nStorrie stars in “Heated Rivalry” as Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hocky champion having a steamy sex-filled years-long affair with his Canadian counterpart Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams). The show — an adaptation of the “Game Changers” novels — chronicles Rozanov and Hollander’s relationship as it goes from something purely physical to to being a deeply romantic and emotional relationship.\n\nThe sixth and final episode of Season 1 finds Rozanov visiting Hollander at his cottage. They finally admit to each other that they’re in love. But then Hollander unexpectedly comes out to his parents as not only being gay but also in a relationship with his career arch-nemesis as his father walks in on the couple kissing after making an unannounced trip to the cottage.\n\nI spoke to Storrie over Zoom video from his Los Angeles-area home ahead of the season finale.\n\nWere you surprised Ilya was the first to say, “I love you”? He said it in the Russian monologue in Episode 5 but this was different because he says it in English and in person.\n\nYeah, but I think this shows Ilya is in it for the long haul and he’s enthusiastic about that.\n\nHe’s also the first to refer to them as boyfriends.\n\nThat’s the thing about these eastern Europeans. They don’t let you in on it. But once you’re in, you’re in for life.\n\nWhat was it like walking into the cottage for the first time?\n\nThat was the element of the story that I was most excited to get to because it’s really cool the way that Jacob Tierney wrote it. There’s this kind of cool crescendo where it was so fast and rapid — the editing, the writing – with so much energy upfront, and then it kind of lands and we’re just two people in a house for a few days. As an actor, that’s where a lot of the cool acting moments are, where we really get to sit in some of those scenes for a long, long time. It’s kind of the episode where there’s officially a catharsis. People don’t realize because of all the intimate scenes but this story really is about people falling in love at a distance. To finally see that come together, there’s a catharsis.\n\nI think viewers may go into Episode 6 thinking it’s going to be a sex fest because Shane and Ilya will be by themselves. There’s some sex, but the episode is about much more than that.\n\nYou get to kind of breathe. They get to be normal on some level, which is what Jacob talks about when he says the “happy ending.” I think what he’s referring to is being emotionally regulated, emotionally aware enough to look each other in the eyes and be like, “I love you, let’s do this.” And then whatever that looks like afterwards, they’re like, “We’re going to sign up for it. We’re signed up and we’re locked in.”\n\nAnd then you literally ride off into the sunset when Shane and Ilya get in the car and leave Shane’s parents’ house.\n\nWe filmed that twice. I don’t know which take they ended up using, but the first take, because we sit there for three or four minutes — we do the full length of that song, which I fucking love — Hudson and I just kind of rode in silence and just cried during that whole scene. As actors, we were like, “We’re killing. We’re in it. This is real, we’re so in love.” Then the music stops and Jacob comes around and is like, “Alrighty, let’s do one where you guys don’t look like you want to kill yourselves. Let’s start over.” He was like, “Be cute. This happy. This is fun.” We interpreted it in a very dramatic way. But, yeah, we literally get to ride off into the sunset.\n\nI think Shane and his mom’s talk outside is going to resonate so much with people. Every kids wants to hear their parents apologize for something they had or hadn’t done.\n\nThey’re both accepting the truth of the matter, and that lets them actually heal from it, rather than it just being a placate-y kind of thing to each other.\n\nMy friend Ben texted me this morning and said the show has “rewired” his brain and he feels he can now finally be able to pursue a relationship.\n\nWow. It’s all about love, baby and realizing the stuff we internalize from the outside world hurts and it affects us. But at the end of the day, you gotta do your thing — whatever that is.\n\nYou’ve talked about being ostracized in high school when some classmates found those Actorboy222 videos. What would you say to those people now?\n\nI don’t feel any sort of way about it. I don’t really villainize anyone no matter how nasty they get because I fully do believe that people are doing their best. I think that people are hurt. I think everyone is so insecure and sad, and we all have these things that are so tender to us, and I just feel blessed to be to have had a human experience that’s been just rugged enough to give me that perspective, to be like, “I don’t really give a shit what words you use to describe me, or if you try to embarrass me because I’ve embarrassed myself a million fucking times. I don’t give a shit anymore. So bring it on. I don’t feel bad about it because, especially how visible everything is now on the internet, if you’re a nasty person, I think that just makes you look nasty. I don’t need to try and make you look nasty. I just try to hold myself with grace and understanding. If you’re trying to belittle someone, it’s probably because you feel pretty small yourself because I know when I’ve been mean in the past — we’ve all done things — it’s because I felt this big [he pinches a thumb and finger together]. I felt itty bitty.\n\nBefore we go, I have to ask – do you actually like tuna melts?\n\nI don’t think I’ve had a real legit tuna melt. Maybe I had one from Subway once. We didn’t eat the best when I was growing up.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:43:12.172211"}

The guy was much like Marty.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAround the same time, he became obsessed with Gabriel’s 1982 song, which he says he listened to over 1,000 times. “I decided to set the footage to that song, and it just worked. Something was happening there; it felt mythic,” Safdie explains. He adds, “There was a contemporary quality to seeing the anachronistic music paired with the ‘40s or early ‘50s.”\n\nSafdie explains how the new wave-flavored music actually makes sense with the film’s themes. “President Reagan was nostalgically in that first era of postmodernism, actively trying to recall the ‘50s. In the face of defeat from Vietnam, culture was really just starting to redo itself in the vein of the ‘50s. You saw it in style. You saw it in movies. ‘Back to the Future’ is literally going back to the ‘50s. But on a very simple level, what happens when you do that is the past starts to feel like it’s haunting the future, and the future feels like it’s haunting the past.”\n\nAt one point, Safdie had written a version of the film where Marty was shown in the 1980s. It was an alternate ending. Safdie says, “He’s at a Tears for Fears concert with his granddaughter, listening to the lyrics of ‘Everybody Wants to Rule the World,’ and reflecting on his youth.”\n\nThat scene was ultimately removed. But Safdie stayed committed to the 1980s tunes including New Order’s as “propulsive, energetic, and fun” while still exploring the concept of the past and future in conversation.\n\nFor the score, Safdie turned to composer Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never), who scored both “Good Time” and “Uncut Gems.” Lopatin, known for inventing vaporwave — a genre of electronic music from the 2010s that offers a nostalgic, surreal take on 1980s music — was the perfect choice to tie the film’s needle-drop moments together. Lopatin says there was no real differentiation between the game of table tennis that Marty plays and his spirit. “He’s buoyant and energetic, and no one believes in him. There’s an energy to him, a buoyancy and a lightness that is mirrored in the game itself,” he says.\n\nLopatin used fast, percussive strikes to keep the score melodic, incorporating mallet strikes to mirror the ping-pong balls. He notes, “Those mallet sounds are also really prominent in new wave music and synth-pop of the ‘80s.”\n\nLopatin was inspired by the concept of memory and time, as well as that original ending. “The score goes back to, what would it be like to think back on your coming of age in the 1950s while hearing Tears for Fears blasting in your ears, and maybe you’re side by side with your children, but somewhere else in your mind?” The result, in Lopatin’s words, was “an abstraction of that Tears for Fears concert.” He describes it as what happens when the present dissolves, and memory and the present converge. “The score is a kind of abstraction or an undercurrent — a symbolic wave of what was in the script.”\n\nTo align with the songs, which also include New Order’s “The Perfect Kiss,” Lopatin used digital synthesizers from the 1980s, including the Yamaha DX7 from 1983. He also incorporated flutes, saxophones, and string arrangements on top.\n\nHis score became was an expression of Marty’s youth, energy and ambition. If Marty is a builder and a bridge between worlds — past, present, and future — so too is the score and its accompanying songs. Safdie concludes, “I think all those things coming together in sync with one another — the synchronicity — has that additive effect of like, ‘Oh my god, this movie’s teeming with life.’”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:45:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T17:55:50.728184"}

Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Morton said he decided to purchase the domain names after Trump “began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“I thought, Yep, that name’s going on the building,” Morton said in the interview. “The rest followed on schedule.” Morton had previously bought domain names domain names associated with Rep.

But I expected that I would’ve been on the stage too with all the other actors. When Garrett [Morris] and Laraine [Newman] went on the stage there, I was curious as to why I didn’t. No one asked me to. Why was I left aside?”\n\nHe added, “I did bring it up once in a text to Lorne [Michaels] and then took it back. I said, ‘Okay, I take it back, silly.’ But it’s not that silly. Somebody’s made a bad mistake there. I don’t know who it was, but somebody made a mistake. They should’ve had me on that stage.

Maybe shoot something else while she gets used to doing this stuff the way you want it,’” Weaver remembered.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCameron took her advice, she added. Weaver said: “He’s a good guy. I really do think Jim has mellowed.”\n\nThe actor also remembered getting dinner with Cameron after the two wrapped production on “Aliens” and “he hadn’t been like that directing. He was wildly funny, witty. I can understand why that guy couldn’t come out during ‘Aliens,’ because that was a tough shoot, especially for him. Let’s put it this way: I’m glad I wasn’t shooting ‘The Abyss’ with him.”\n\nWeaver is referring to Cameron’s 1989 thriller starring Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The film’s production was fraught, to say the least, with the cast and crew’s health and safety constantly in jeopardy. As recounted by SyFy: “Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on set, and Harris admitted he broke into a fit of sobbing while driving home one day because of the stress. At one point, a lightning storm ripped a hole in the black tarp covering the tank, and since repairing it took too much time and production was already running over, they started shooting at night. Too much exposure to chlorine burned divers’ skin and turned their hair white.”\n\n“We were guinea pigs, in a way,” Harris once told Entertainment Weekly. “Jim wasn’t quite sure how this was all gonna go down… [in the drowning scene I was] screaming at her to come back and wake up, and I was slapping her across the face and I see that they’ve run out of film in the camera — there’s a light on the camera — and nobody had said anything. And Mary Elizabeth stood up and said, ‘We are not animals!” and walked off the set. They were going to let me just keep slapping her around!”\n\nWhatever Cameron was like on past sets did not deter Weaver from reuniting with him on the “Avatar” franchise. She’s starred in all three “Avatar” movies so far. Her co-star Stephen Lang told The Times that “a part of Jim that has leavened and lightened much over the years,” adding: “I think he embarked upon a course of self-improvement, and I don’t say that this is actually necessarily a conscious thing that he did; I just think that he’s kind of geared that way.”\n\n“Marinating, maybe, is a good term, right?” Cameron himself told the publication. “It’s not like I was a screamer all day long. But every once in a while. Everybody’s entitled to a bad day. If you’re not doing the job, then get out of my way.”\n\nCameron’s latest, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” is now playing in theaters nationwide.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:59:36 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T20:28:32.391130"}

At a holiday party Saturday night celebrating the birthdays of Roadside Attractions co-president Erik d&#8217;Arbeloff, who turned 60, and his son Lucas, who turned 21, I had a number of conversations with various industry types and Academy voters in the crowd at Smog Shoppe on [&#8230;]", "content": "A column chronicling conversations and events on the awards circuit.\n\nAt a holiday party Saturday night celebrating the birthdays of Roadside Attractions co-president Erik d’Arbeloff, who turned 60, and his son Lucas, who turned 21, I had a number of conversations with various industry types and Academy voters in the crowd at Smog Shoppe on La Cienega. It is always interesting to see — especially on the cusp of the new rear — just how many have yet to see so many of the Oscar contenders at this late date in the game.\n\nNomination balloting begins on January 12 at 9 a.m. PT and ends January 16 at 5 p.m. PT. Fortunately, they have the two-week holiday break (some key companies shut down for the entire time) so, if so inclined, Oscar voters who are usually last on the trail have a chance to catch up after slews of critics orgs and even President Barack Obama have weighed in on the field.\n\nWB AWARDS\n\nYes there is a dedicated crowd of AMPAS voters who try to keep up and see what’s out there in a timely fashion, yet unless you are One Battle After Another, Sinners, Frankenstein or Avatar: Fire and Ash, or maybe a handful of other titles, an average audience of AMPAS members and their guests on a decent turnout might be around 200 in the 1000-seat Samuel Goldwyn Theatre, where official Academy screenings are held. On a recent weekend, about 90 turned out for the prime Sunday show of Gus Van Sant’s Dead Man’s Wire, a little more than half that for Lucy Liu’s terrific performance in the indie drama Rosemead the next Saturday — and that was with Q&As with many of the principals involved. Of course the Academy has a digital screening room now — like most voting groups — so it is harder to lure voters out of their homes unless it is very high profile and a “must see” on a large movie screen (the Academy’s is the best in town). Other screening opportunities that come with Q&As receptions and food at places like Ross House, Soho House, The London Hotel and other favored venues draw their fair share, so it is not for lack of opportunity to see these films.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nNetflix\n\nIn a good move, AMPAS tweaked voting rules last season to assure that those casting ballots have actually seen the films nominated. Again, that is only after nominations for the final ballot in all categories. “You do not need to save movie stubs, tickets or receipts,” the academy wrote in its Octeber 30, 2024 email to its voting members. “This is an honor system.”\n\nSo how it works is members who watch on the Academy’s official steaming site will be automatically verified. For films that members watch somewhere else, they must indicate it by marking “watched” next to the film’s name on the service or app. Thus the Academy is able to notify members what films they still need to watch before voting. Of course, who is to say some don’t just begin a movie on the service and leave the room? I don’t believe that happened widely and this is a good step forward, but it is only after nominations, not deciding what gets nominated, a much wider swatch of films that can be daunting for any diligent member.\n\nIncreasingly though, it feels like the Academy, and to be fair many other groups including critics, zero in on a handful of movies and vote down the ballot, even with requirements to see everything. The triumph of Anora seemed like that kind of case, an indie movie more widely seen than you might imagine in the Academy (and that might have been due to the new requirements for viewing every nominee) and getting checked off on the ballot in just about every category it was in. It’s a distinct advantage for those movies that can break through at the last minute and not be on members’ “Oh yeah, I have to see that one” or “I should see that, just haven’t had time yet.” lists. So hopefully in the next two and a half weeks voters will find the time to see more films pre-nomination balloting, though I am getting the feeling this might be one of those years where the ultimate winners seem more predictable, at least in conversations I have been having.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio in ‘One Battle After Another’ Warner Bros./Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n“So is it already a done deal, we know what’s winning?” one veteran producer and Oscar voter asked me as I stood at the bar at the Roadside party. And yes, I immediately knew he was talking about One Battle After Another, the Warner Bros title that is not also a description of its current status as a studio for sale. I moderated the official AMPAS screening back in September to what is quite unusual: a turn-away crowd at the Goldwyn and a massive standing ovation for Paul Thomas Anderson in addition to enthusiastic receptions for its cast members, so its success and popularity in the industry is not surprising. Anderson is overdue and the movie is one that filmmakers love.\n\nI am sure the producer was also referring to the endless drumbeat of early wins on the critics awards circuit for the movie; it won at the Gothams, the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles and New York film critics, and has racked up numerous other Best Picture prizes wherever it seems to go. Usually, critics groups aren’t so aligned with industry sentiment, but that appears to be the trajectory here. With a leading nine Golden Globes nominations and 14 more at Critics Choice, it is in as strong a position as you can possibly be at this point in the game. But being a front-runner this early is treacherous: The aforementioned Anora didn’t establish itself as the one to beat until February, when it won at the delayed Critics Choice ceremony and then back to back the next night at the DGAs and PGAs. Without question the most important voices are yet to be heard from, and won’t be until after the New Year with all the guilds, BAFTA and then finally the Academy. Many a front-runner has been tripped up on the way to Oscar Sunday, so always beware.\n\n‘Sinners’ Warner Bros.\n\nWhat could stop it in its tracks? Start with another Warner Bros title, Sinners, which is also not a name the WBD board uses to describe the Ellisons. While One Battle has 14 CCA nominations, Sinners leads everyone with 17 and was named in every single category it was eligible for on the Oscar shortlists. Could that film change the momentum game and surprise, especially for a movie released in the unfriendly Oscar month of April? Will Warners find itself split with love for both Anderson and Sinners director Ryan Coogler? These are the questions I am asking. If there is a split, will it be to the benefit of Guillermo del Toro’s Netflix hit Frankenstein? Wouldn’t that be a touch of irony considering all that is going on in town these days. Del Toro is enormously beloved and the movie is a marvel of the kind of craft Oscar has always loved, or at least used to love.\n\n‘Hamnet’ Agata Grzybowska/Focus Features\n\nThen there is Focus Features’ Hamnet, a gut-wrenching wallop from Oscar winner Chloe Zhao (Nomadland). This isn’t just some indie movie. Its producers are Amblin’, Steven Spielberg and Sam Mendes, okay? They have a lot of power and persuasion in Hollywood, and this film does what overall you want every film to do, to leave you with a shot to the heart and an emotional ending like no other. That counts for a lot, and you could tell right from the first screening in Telluride that it landed. Focus has never won the Best Picture Oscar (neither has Netflix), and Universal is likely to be lending its heft to its campaign too, but remember they also have their own Wicked: For Good , hoping it finds its mojo in the Best Picture race this year or is relegated again ulitmately to just crafts recognition. It’s impressive showing on the Oscar shortlists with a co-leading 8 is promising. Yest it is always hard for Part 2’s to prevail, but don’t tell that to The Godfather Part II or Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.\n\nTimothée Chalamet in ‘ Marty Supreme A24\n\nAnd what of A24’s Christmas juggernaut, Marty Supreme which already seems a shoe-in for marketing movie of the year thanks to its star Timothee Chalamet who also seems in line for the top marketing job at A24 in his spare time. Critically and perhaps boxoffice-wise (it came in a surprising second to Avatar: Fire And Ash on Christmas day) it is poised to be a spoiler since it also set records for limited release last weekend. Can the Chalamet express go all the way to the Dolby station?\n\nThen there is the question of the ever-growing international vote in the Academy, the swing voters who really can make a difference and this year there are some prime contenders with Sentimental Value, It Was Just An Accident, Sirat, The Secret Agent all coming out of Cannes and gunning next for Oscar. This year can especially be telling in terms of the power of the international vote where purely America-centric movies like One Battle and Sinners may find a tougher audience – or not. Great filmmaking is great filmmaking no matter what part of the world it is showing us.\n\nSo thinking about it my response to that producer I told you about might be not so fast. Stay tuned.\n\nOSCAR’S COMEBACK OF THE MONTH – DECEMBER\n\nIf One Battle After Another has been the presumed leader of the Oscar race since its September debut, Warner Bros took a distinctly different campaign strategy with their other juggernaut, Sinners which debuted way back in April, a release date where it is easy to be forgotten by the time the actual season rolls around and Fall releases, even Summer releases in some cases (we’re talking about YOU Oppenheimer and Barbie), take precedent in the race for Hollywood’s most prestigious honor. Basically Warners held back its relaunch until November when star Michael B. Jordan was available after wrapping shooting on The Thomas Crown Affair in Europe, and especially this month when it seemed Sinners was everywhere on the FYC circuit, with numerous stars hosting FYC events aimed at regaining the attention of Oscar voters, and other groups. It certainly seems to have worked as the film led the aforementioned Oscar shortlists with 8, as well as the aforementioned Critics Choice Awards with a near-record 17 (final voting is now open through Jan 2 at CCA and through Jan 3 for Golden Globes while SAG announced nominations Jan 7), both indicating the enthusiastic backing it has in crafts and below the line categories, something very important within the Academy as it indicates strong across the board support among the overall membership, not just the marquee acting, writing and directing categories. Sinners could very well lead all comers when Oscar nominations are announced on January 22.\n\nAmong those hosting Sinners events were Spike Jonze, Christopher Nolan, Lupita Nyong’o, Questlove, Viola Davis, Austin Butler, Kenneth Branagh, Destin Daniel Cretton, Idris Elba, Ben Stiller, Denzel Washington, and Barry Jenkins.\n\nDenzel Washington (R) moderates ‘Sinners’ with co-star Delroy Lindo at Harmony Gold Theatre.

He meets an injured man protecting a briefcase holding something valuable enough to shoot Henry in the hand to try to protect it.\n\nNoah Schnapp as Will Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThere was Will’s (Noah Schnapp) emotional coming out scene, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy’s (Natalia Dyer) cathartic breakup scene, Max’s (Sadie Sink) epic return to the world of the living and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and so much more.\n\nHere to break it all down for Variety — and tease where things will go in the “Stranger Things” series finale — is executive producer Shawn Levy, who directed Episode 6 and co-directed Episode 7 alongside the Duffer brothers.\n\nWe now know Eleven is the most successful of Brenner’s experiments because she tolerated the blood transfusion from Henry the best. And this means that even if the team kills Vecna, this cycle is not over, because the military wants to use El to make more kids like her. Kali tells El they should kill themselves to end it. Can you talk about creating those life and death stakes for Eleven going into the series finale?\n\nWell, first of all, that was incredibly concisely summarized.\n\nThank you.\n\nI hope that if anyone ever asks me to summarize the plot revelations of Volume 2, I can just remember your words, because they were incredibly succinct. I mean, to your point, these are profound existential questions being asked in Volume 2. And this deep questioning of, what is sacrifice? What is a worthy sacrifice? And how do you put the needs of the many in front of the needs of oneself? These are age-old existential questions, and I am really excited for fans to see our show wrestle with them.\n\nWe hopefully do it in ways that are emotional and still entertaining. But when you have characters like Holly and El questioning profound life and death values, like the ones they wrestle with in Volume 2, those scenes need to be handled with care. They need to be written with nuance, and they then need to be performed and directed with sensitivity to the weight of the issues being grappled with.\n\nSadie Sink as Max Mayfield in Season 4 of “Stranger Things.” Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhat did you want to show with the scene where Max and Holly (Nell Fisher) say goodbye in Vecna’s mind in Episode 6? How did you work through what real-world Max would look like, and what she could feasibly do to help now that she’s back?\n\nThe end of Episode 6, that was a really memorable day because I was given the privilege of directing a scene that required both actresses to deliver big time and with tremendous emotional weight. The writing was excellent. The actors, Nell and Sadie, stepped up so impressively, but it had this added layer of meaning for Sadie and I, because Episode 6 of Season 5 is in some ways an echo of our “Dear Billy” episode [Episode 4, Season 4] that Sadie and I are sort of connected for life in from Season 4. A similar red void, a similar epic run using both real speed and slow motion, and set against, no coincidence here, a new orchestration of “Running Up That Hill.”\n\nIt’s certainly a sequence that I’ll cherish forever, because it served as a bookend to “Dear Billy” in many ways, and it allowed Sadie and I to revisit that sequence from the end of “Dear Billy” that we will carry with us forever. Because even if we wanted to leave it behind, audiences around the world remind us of that sequence pretty much every day of our lives. So the design of this abstract red void with these extraordinary, odd, otherworldly structures, but with a glimpse of the world that is on the other side, the aspirational yearning that Max has carried with her is manifested. And when she looks through that cloudy portal and sees herself with Lucas next to her, still holding vigil, it was such an emotion premise for a scene, and I think it’s clear that it resonated emotionally for Sadie and all of us who were part of that sequence.\n\nOne day I’ll never forget filming Season 5 was that first scene after Max comes back to life when she is on that table in that laundry room. And it took, like, one take for her and Caleb to deliver some of their most beautiful work in any season. Many of us were teary as we watched these beautiful actors do such great work. I think that Max’s superpower, having returned to life, to the world, is that, as I think we say in the show, she’s been on the other side. She has, in some ways, mapped the target, and can therefore be an essential ally in strategizing how we go at that target, how we go after Vecna.\n\nNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers Courtesy of Netflix\n\nCan you talk about the choice to have Nancy and Jonathan’s relationship, which was built on a deep trauma bond, end by them having a new deeply traumatic shared experience that caused them to be honest?\n\nI love that the Duffers and the writers named the fact on camera, in character, they named the fact that the Nancy-Jonathan connection has been rooted in shared trauma. So I like that there’s an awareness, not only in the writing of the show, but in the characters. And we always knew that this was going to be the watershed “Jancy” scene that was almost a decade in the making, and it’s a long scene. It’s incredibly rich in its writing, and it’s acting, and Natalia and Charlie prepared for months for that scene. And I think in acknowledging the shared trauma in their history, Jonathan and Nancy are able to be honest about their past and clear-eyed in assessing their present and would-be future.\n\nWhat’s it like to direct the revelations about what Vecna actually going to do, turn the world into the Upside Down? Is Vecna just a nihilist?\n\nWell, for one thing, I would say that for those of us, and anyone who has seen “The First Shadow” on stage, that “Stranger Things” play fills in a lot of blanks about Henry Creel’s backstory. And for me personally, knowing that I was going to be directing Jamie as Henry/One/Vecna in our final season, the stage play gave me a much deeper empathy for Vecna, and it gave me an understanding of the wounds he carries, where they came from, and how formative they were in his youth.\n\nSo yes, current day Vecna seems to be just straight up nihilistic, but the world has hurt him so much that now he just wants to hurt it back.\n\nDirecting Noah Schnapp in Will’s coming out scene in Episode 7, did you have any specific discussions about preferences in what Will would do and how others would react — even subtle details?\n\nCertainly that’s a question worth asking the Duffers. So Matt, Ross and I all chatted and worked with Noah well in advance of shooting that scene. And I personally ran through the scene with Noah and talked through it and the evolution of Will’s sharing in it. Bear in mind that Noah, quite famously and quite publicly, brings personal experience to that scene. So we came with a lot of instincts about how to approach it. And between Matt and Ross and I, and with the benefit of exceptional writing by the Duffers, it was about calibrating the feeling and calibrating how emotional Will gets at what stage of the scene.\n\nAnd as far as all of the listeners, all of those reaction shots that for me personally, as just a viewer, those are what really break me. Those cutaways to Jonathan to Robin to Max to Mike, those are just authentic reactions of Noah’s castmates and friends as their buddy gave a powerhouse performance in an all-timer of a scene. What you see on screen is what went down on that set, and it’s just authentic and honest and required very little prep or discussion.\n\nMatt Duffer, Ted Sarandos, Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy and Bela Bajaria attend “Stranger Things” Season 5 World Premiere at TCL Chinese 6 Theatres on November 6, 2025 in Hollywood, California. Courtesy of Getty Images for Netflix\n\nWhat was your final day on set like?\n\nLike for everyone, the last day was an emotional day. The two moments I will personally never forget are the very small, intimate read through of the final episode. It was literally the cast and maybe a half-dozen other people that were allowed in that room. I was lucky enough to be one of them — because I’ve walked the long road over a decade with the show — that day. And the way those actors, and particularly those young actors, came undone emotionally as we read it, is something so beautiful. I’ll never forget it.\n\nAnd then on my very last day, I went to the Wheeler basement, and it was empty. No one was shooting there, and I sat on those stairs, and I sat on that couch, and I just steeped myself in 10 years of memories, 10 years of this challenge, and above all, 10 years of this privilege of being a part of this show as both an executive producer and frequent director. It’s changed me forever, and I sat there in the quiet of that iconic basement feeling very grateful.\n\nThe man with briefcase that Henry meets in that mine shaft in the Nevada desert. What’s in that briefcase, Shawn? Is there more to the Henry/Dimension X story of how Henry got his powers that day in the desert than was shown in “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” that’s coming in the finale?\n\nYes. Hard, yes. Emphatic, “yes,” he said, as he nodded his head vigorously.\n\nIs the Abyss, the other world where Henry is — which is connected to Earth via the Upside Down/wormhole — also Dimension X, the place he originally entered when he first got his powers in the desert as a child?\n\nThat is a really great question you should ask the Duffers. And you can tell them that I believe I am correct in saying, no. It’s the Abyss, and I believe the Abyss is not Dimension X. Ask the Duffers, and I can’t wait to read your article, so I can finally understand the answer.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nInside\n\nthe Upside Down\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers\n\n• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers\n\n• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale\n\n• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2\n\n• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1\n\n• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1\n\n• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5\n\n• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers\n\n• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)\n\n• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’\n\n• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5\n\n• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:30:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T20:46:19.622584"}

I wasn’t sure how I would feel… whether it would be something very emotionally connective because I put the Man of Steel suit back on.

According [&#8230;]", "content": "Tyler Perry has been sued over allegations of sexual assault brought by a new accuser, an actor who appeared in the 2016 movie “Boo! A Madea Halloween.”\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mario Rodriguez alleges that Perry assaulted him on multiple occasions over several years at Perry’s Los Angeles home. According to the complaint, Perry allegedly made unwanted sexual advances toward Rodriguez, including a 2018 incident in which Perry “tightly hugged” him and “grabbed his penis.”\n\nRodriguez, who played “Frat Guy #10” in Perry’s “Boo! A Madea Halloween,” is suing for sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He is also bringing a claim against Lionsgate, distributor of “Boo! A Madea Halloween,” for allegedly ignoring Perry’s actions. Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe complaint describes an incident that allegedly occurred in Perry’s home screening room a few months after they met in 2015. “Mr. Perry then put his hand on Mr. Rodriguez’s leg and began rubbing his inner thigh right next to his penis. Mr. Perry told Mr. Rodriguez ‘It’s ok,’ while he continued to rub his thigh.”\n\nRodriguez alleges that the two broke off contact in 2019 but that Perry would periodically reach out to him after that. The complaint states that Rodriguez was motivated to bring his claim against Perry after reading reports about Derek Dixon’s lawsuit earlier this year.\n\nIn response to Rodriguez’s suit, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Perry, said in a statement shared with Variety, “Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab.”\n\nSpiro was referring to another lawsuit against Perry filed in June. Dixon, an actor who appeared on Perry’s BET series “The Oval,” accused the filmmaker of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nDixon, who appeared in 85 episodes of the drama show, alleged that while staying at the entertainment mogul’s guesthouse in June 2021, Perry grabbed his buttocks while intoxicated. The lawsuit also cited alleged text messages in which Perry is said to have made repeated sexual comments and advances over several years. Dixon is seeking at least $260 million in punitive damages.\n\nJonathan Delshad, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represents Rodriguez and Dixon, pointed to numerous text messages allegedly exchanged between Rodriguez and Perry that bolster his client’s claims.\n\n“Mr. Rodriguez is looking forward to his day in court and holding Mr. Perry accountable for his actions. We do hope a jury awards enough money to make Perry regret his actions,” Delshad said. “Unfortunately, statements like those made by Perry’s attorneys do nothing but enable Mr. Perry to continue to victimize people like Mr. Rodriguez. My client looks forward to a jury’s determination of what happened.”\n\n“Mr. Rodriguez realized that Mr. Perry was continuing to use his power and influence to sexually assault hopeful actors and, with the voice of others, decided that it was time to tell his story, to obtain justice, and to finally stop Mr. Perry,” the new complaint states. “When Perry became aware that Rodriguez was going to file this action, Perry once again reached out to Rodriguez by text, telling Rodriguez that Perry did so much to help Rodriguez and was that Perry was feeling betrayed by Rodriguez.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:05:57 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T22:25:42.100213"}

The Oscar-winning director has been vocal on the “Fire and Ash” press tour that the future of the “Avatar” franchise depends on the third movie being a financial success. Cameron is prepared to end the series if it’s not.\n\n“I don’t know if the saga goes beyond this point. I hope it does,” Cameron told EW. “But, you know, we prove that business case every time we go out… “If we don’t get to make 4 and 5, for whatever reason, I’ll hold a press conference and I’ll tell you what we were gonna do. How’s that?”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCameron said his other option is to novelize his scripts for “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5,” adding: “There’s so much culture and backstory and lateral detail in these characters that’s been worked out. I’d love to do something that’s at that level of granular detail.”\n\nDuring an interview with Variety, Cameron said “we’re getting ahead of ourselves” when asked about “Avatar 3” because “we’ve got to make some money with this one. Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business case yet again. The world has changed. We all know the stats, where theatrical is. It’s been a bad year. It’s starting to perk up a little bit with a couple of recent releases: ‘Wicked: For Good’ has done well, and ‘Zootopia 2’ is doing well. So, we’ll see.”\n\nIt appears Cameron might not need to hold a press tour to reveal the final two “Avatar” movies because “Fire and Ash” is performing quite well at the box office. The movie crossed the $500 million mark at the worldwide box office after one week in theaters and is expected to have strong holds into the new year. The previous two “Avatar” movies both cleared the $2 billion mark worldwide.\n\nJon Landau, the franchise’s late producer, let it slip to Gizmodo in 2022 that “Avatar 5” brings the Na’vi characters to earth, adding: “And we go to it to open people’s eyes, open Neytiri’s eyes, to what exists on Earth.”\n\nCameron has left it up in the air whether or not he will direct the next two “Avatar” movies himself. He told Empire in 2022 that helming the franchise is “all-consuming” and he might want to “pass the baton” to another director starting with “Avatar 4.” But he recently said before “Fire and Ash’s” release that “there’s no reason not to” direct the next sequel himself.\n\n“I’m healthy, I’m good to go. I’m not going to rule it out,” Cameron added. “I mean, I’ve got to make it in a vigorous way, to handle the kind of volume and energy of the work for another six or seven years. You know what I mean?

But what really sold star Hudson Williams on the series was the quiet yet heavy scene in the Season 1 finale that shows Shane’s mother (Christina Chang) asking her son for forgiveness for not allowing him to feel safe enough to come out to her sooner as gay.\n\n“That scene was the scene that ruined me the most when I read the script,” Williams tells me. “It was the scene that I was like, ‘If I don’t get to play Shane Hollander.’ It’s also a scene that’s not in the book, but to me it is the quintessential wrap-up scene to that arc for him and his mom. Period.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFor those who may not already know, “Heated Rivalry” is Jacob Tierney’s six-episode adaptation of Rachel Reid’s queer hockey romance novel series “Game Changers.” The show, acquired for U.S. distribution by HBO Max from Canadian streamer Crave, follows Shane Hollander and Ilya Rosanov (Connor Storrie), two superstar hockey players who fall in love as they navigate a secret years-long affair. The show has been greenlit for a second season.\n\nThe mother-and-son scene filmed over two days. “The first time we couldn’t get through it because it started raining,” Hudson recalls. “And then we came back the next day to shoot it, Jacob goes, ‘I rewrote it.’ So Christina and I are in the little makeup room of this little cottage, memorizing the scene, and it was so beautiful. It made so much sense. It stands on the right side of what I think a parent should be because there are outdated notions. There are old school ways of parenting that maybe we can leave in the past…As someone who thinks of raising their kids in the future and wanting to be a father, this is the environment you have to foster.”\n\nWe truly don’t know until we see her accept him if she is going to accept him or reject him. Will she be like, “You’ve just ruined your career?” But in the end, she’s talking about how this could be good for endorsement deals.\n\nShane gets a release to a degree, but I’m not sure it’s a full one. I think there’s still a degree to Shane where it’s like, a part of me wanted a bigger release. I remember leaving and going, “I wish I could pour myself into it and completely get vulnerable.” As an actor, that’s never really been that hard for me. I was retroactively trying to figure out why am I not fully able to get this. But then, I was like, “Oh, it’s Shane who isn’t able to get that fully.” It’s a little bit of a release he gets but even still, he’s avoiding her a little bit. He can’t look her in the eyes and feel completely like he’s lived to all the standards of what he thinks this unwritten idea of what a man is between them.\n\nI love that Ilya was the first to say, “I love you.” He said it in the Russian monologue, but that doesn’t count for Shane because he didn’t know what Ilya was saying.\n\nThe motherfucker beat me.\n\nWere you surprised he said it first?\n\nYeah, but even though Shane doesn’t say it first, he says all these things that are, if they’re not love, what the fuck are they? You know, “Let’s start a foundation.” He’s staying up in the middle of the night plotting their way. When Ilya says, “You think that far ahead, Hollander?” “I do about this.” Hollander is not a planner. He’s a diligent worker. He’s someone who is routine — dial in, show up in the game today, show up in practice right now. Forget in five years. Be the best hockey player now. It’s out of character to let this game plan run so far ahead. But it is because he loves Ilya so dearly. So I think he, even though he didn’t say it first, he made that cottage a home for Ilya to be able to say it.\n\nI thought the cottage was going to be, excuse my French, a fuck fest. But this was more about the emotional journey and being a couple.\n\nJacob Tierney recently said it — it’s boyfriend.\n\nBut then there’s the blowjob scene. That was comedy.\n\nThat was improv.\n\nWhat?\n\nYeah, to a degree. Connor and I were kind of goofing off in the makeup trailer, which was a cottage that was a two-minute drive away from that cottage, getting ready. I was preparing my monologue the whole morning. I’m prepping it, working it. Then Connor, being the great scene partner he is, he was like, “I’ll be here doing this.” Then he did something and we were hitting each other, goofing off. Then he’s hitting me, hitting me and he did this slap. I was filming myself on my phone doing this. I was like, “Do that again.” I couldn’t hold in my laughter because it was so brilliant. It’s so funny, and it makes sense for where they’re at in the story. I remember showing that to the intimacy coordinator. She was cackling. She’s like, “You have to do that.” Then Jacob was like, “Go for it. Go crazy.” The first take was the first time I broke broke because Connor is taking all the liberties. I am shoving him. I’m slapping him back. I’m putting the phone away to get in the gasps and moans. I’m so happy with how that scene turned out.\n\nShane and Ilya are finally comfortable with each other enough for that. They’ve let their guards down.\n\nI heard Jacob say earlier today, “That’s boyfriends.” You don’t get the blow job on the phone from your fuck buddy or your friends with benefits. You get that when you’re in a relationship. In Episodes 1 and 2, it’s lust — it’s charged and fast. But now we have humor and levity within the sex.\n\nWhat was it like filming in the cottage for the first time?\n\nIt’s when sentiment of the show really matched the sentiment of where we are in filming. That was the last two days of shooting. The last scene we shot was Ilya talking about his mom when he’s on my lap. I remember the first time we walked through there, I was like, “Damn right, Mr. Real Estate! This is a pretty nice cottage.” That was finally where Shane can be as boring as he wants and as fun as he wants. He gets to be everything. They have those two weeks.\n\nAnd then you literally ride off into the sunset.\n\nIt’s still bittersweet. A lot of people have said that’s a very happy ending, but I’m like, “This isn’t a straight story.” This is not the happy ending because they’re still in the closet. They’re not coming out to Reebok, they’re not coming out to anyone. They got caught. It looks more like forgiveness than pride. That’s where they’re at. Forgiveness implies there’s something that was wrongfully done.\n\nThere’s shame around being caught. Just the word “caught” implies something to be ashamed about.\n\nAnd they were just kissing. They’re not fucking butt naked on the countertop.\n\nDo you have any plans to leave the internet?\n\nI have been periodically leaving the internet. I touch into the internet. I try to stay gone, but very luckily, it’s been pretty warm. The hateful comments are easy to disregard to a degree because they’re coming from such vile places of bias or they’re just obnoxious. It’s closer to trolling than it is criticism.\n\nAlso, “Heated Rivalry” is not reality. It’s like a good rom-com where we get to fantasize about love and romance.\n\nIt’s optimistic.\n\nIt’s OK to be optimistic. So many people just want to be negative.\n\nEven queer storytellers sometimes want to double down on pessimism. I think the reason why our show is doing so well is it doesn’t want to reinforce the worst fears.\n\nDo you like tuna melts?\n\nI do, but I don’t eat carbs or cheese. But as a treat, I’ll take a tuna melt with a nice brioche.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited and condensed.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://variety.com/feed/", "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:47:24 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-26T22:58:02.825037"}

With 2025 expected to file between $8.8 billion-$8.9 billion, essentially, it’s the difference of one tentpole not working, so, take your pick: Paramount‘s Running Man, Disney’s Tron: Ares and/or Elio.\n\nThat miss aside, the domestic box office post-Covid has a good thing going on with the third $8.5B+ year in a row. How long then can the entertainment industry keep theatrical moviegoing alive in the face of the potential gloom and doom from Netflix‘s anticipated swallow-up of Warner Bros? The pandemic and the 2023 strikes dashed all hopes of box office rebuilding to a $10B-$11B annual business. Give thanks for what we have: the second-best year at the B.O. post Covid after 2023’s record $9B.\n\nSome studio execs, counting the approximate 12-month regulatory period for Netflix to wed Warners, believe that the theatrical business has three years left of great juice before ticket sales head for a downturn — that is if Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos collapses the exclusive theatrical window to 17-days.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThat’s the worst-case scenario, not a calculated forecast by Ernst & Young.\n\nAnd true, when it comes to David Ellison‘s bid for Warner Bros, it ain’t over, till it’s over; the Paramount CEO unwilling to go quietly into that night. A Warner Bros combo with the Melrose Ave. lot is a whole other set of agita. Still, there’s a small sense of ease with Ellison as he’s known to be a champion for theatrical; he’s even made the lofty promise to keep two major studio slates afloat at 30 movies a year.\n\nThe bigger paranoia for the future of moviegoing lies with a Netflix-Warner Bros dystopian future, particularly since the latter has accepted the former’s bid officially.\n\nHowever, at this point in time, there’s a mixed bag of theories out there in regards to Netflix’s long-term impact on theatrical.\n\nYes, yes, Sarandos has been on a press tour of late, exclaiming that he’s pro-theatrical (despite whatever he’s said in the past), that he’ll respect the terms of Warner Bros theatrical commitments for the slate he inherits (figuring it’s from 2027 or 2028 onward). Netflix and Warner Bros, aside from HBO Max, arguably complement each other: Netflix gets access to a global theatrical distribution network that they’ve never had before, a whole other line of cash.\n\nFor some of the executive sources, who asked to speak anonymously to us, Netflix’s $83 billion pending purchase of Warner Bros was symbolic in a bad way: A price that high indicates that the streamer is out to decimate the theatrical business.\n\nWhy spend all that money, Netflix, when you can license content at a fraction of the cost?\n\nThe belief by cynics is that Netflix wants to be a streaming service. The end. Anyone who is watching a movie in a theater, isn’t at home watching Netflix. How does the streamer even begin to wrap its heads around a downstream ancillary model of international TV windows? Will they, gulp, embrace the cottage industry that is PVOD? But that’s so old fashioned by Los Gatos tech standards. Their desire for a 17-day theatrical window is a farm-to-table model that gets big screen fare on the service ASAP.\n\nHowever, shorter windows leads to the failure of more movies (particularly original and indie titles), which leads to cinemas closing and rising average ticket prices which some say are already too high (EntTelligence reports average ticket price was $13.29 for 2025, premium large format ticket was $17.65).\n\nOther major studio production bosses have a Zen mindset and that’s one studio alone can’t unilaterally crush the theatrical window. But isn’t there a drip factor? Aren’t moviegoing patterns already changing post-Covid? The programmatic reason to attend the cinemas has eroded greatly. Exhibit A: All those dark, upscale, sophisticated movies that failed in the fall. One of the reasons blamed are that shorter windows post pandemic have influenced older adult moviegoers to skip cinemas and wait for titles at home.\n\n(L-R) Netflix-co-CEO Ted Sarandos, WBD Ceo David Zaslav & Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters\n\nNow there’s a faction who gives Sarandos the benefit of the doubt, that he’s not completely the grim reaper of theatrical.\n\nSays who? Myriad Warner Bros insiders who heard him and co-CEO Greg Peters speak on Dec. 17 on the Burbank, CA lot. They say he’s excited about theatrical and the WB asset, and he relayed that passion. Don’t bet against him.\n\nAlso, those giving confidence to Sarandos, are his former exec colleagues who’ve relocated to other motion picture-streamers. They say he’ll size Warner’s theatrical business up, notice its worth properly, be open minded, and not destory it. Not to mention, movies that played in cinemas constantly rank in Netflix’s top 10, and are the drivers of subscriptions and views. Currently, Sony has a pay-one U.S. window with Netflix that’s up for renewal next year.\n\n“If Netflix wanted to kill theatrical, they could have just bought the top three exhibitors for close to $20 billion, which is significantly less than Warner Bros” says one cinema partner who is optimistic about a future with the streamer.\n\nThe next test how Netflix handles theatrical is with Greta Gerwig’s $200M Narnia movie which is on a 28-day exclusive window in global Imax auditoriums. Does the movie go wide? That hasn’t been announced yet. Netflix just bungled the handling of Rian Johnson’s Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery which didn’t play the top three circuits -AMC, Regal and Cinemark- due to a shortened window. As such, the movie made $4M in its first five days versus the $15M+ first week that the previous Netflix-released Knives Out franchise title, Glass Onion, posted (Netflix’s defense is that they kept all their awards prestige titles, i.e. Frankenstein, Jay Kelly, A House of Dynamite on a 17-day theatrical window).\n\nA stat for Netflix to keep in mind: Of the 760 million who attended movies this year in North America per EntTelligence, 21% of them went to see a Warner Bros movie (compare this to Disney, the No. 1 studio, which repped 25% of 2025 annual admissions. Universal pulled in 18.5% of admissions, with Paramount at 6.4%, Sony at 6.3%, Lionsgate at 3.7% and A24 at 2.4%). There’s several billion-dollar plus potential tentpole movies in the mix for next year, i.e. Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, Star Wars: Mandalorian and Grogu, Super Mario Bros Galaxy, Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Some event pics are even fearlessly facing off against each other next Christmas, i.e. Dune: Part III (which will keep Imax screens, and not move) against Avengers: Doomsday. Ya don’t get to $1 billion in 17 days like Zootopia 2 unless people are aware they can’t watch the movie in 17 days (successful Disney movies have an exclusive theatrical window to SVOD that’s typically 100-plus days). After one of the best Christmas holidays at the B.O. post Covid at $68M, and with a mid-budgeted movie like Marty Supreme heading to a $25M-$30M 4-day start, along with a 3D spectacle like James Cameron’s Avatar: Fire and Ash (already past a half billion worldwide), it’s clear the audience still crave the theatrical experience. Audiences delivered Netflix their first No. 1 grossing movie in KPop Demon Hunters Singalong back in August with $19M. The Stranger Things series finale in theaters over New Year’s Eve and Day is buzzed to have sold out myriad auditoriums.\n\nBut after the Warner Bros merger honeymoon is over, two-to-three years from now, if Netflix attempts to take the industry to a 17-day theatrical window, who will stop them? Will exhibition truly back-stop them? Or will they cave in out of financial desperation like they did when they played KPop Demon Hunters after the movie already streamed on Netflix for about a month? Would they reject playing Matt Reeves’ The Batman 2 on a 17-day window? Or play it, because it’s Batman? The movie is currently dated for an Oct. 1, 2027 release. Will the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences protect the theatrical window by insisting that all movies yearning to qualify for the Oscars play at least 30 days exclusively in cinemas? Highly unlikely as Netflix is already a $5M-$10M donor to the Academy Museum. Will the talent reps rise up like they did against former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar’s popcorn project and speak truth to power? And anti-trust federal regulators? Hello, Bueller, are you there?\n\nNo doubt, it will take a village to keep the legacy studio model and the theatrical business alive.\n\nObserves one film financier about the streamer vs. theatrical hostility: “A casino is a great business, yes, for the owners of the casino. It’s bad for everyone else. Everyone who goes through it is a loser, and it’s bad for the town where the casino exists. It’s bad for culture at large. Likewise, a streaming service is a great business for the owner of an SVOD service. Stable cash, no risk to your content. But is it a great business for culture? No.”", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:42:33 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T02:14:52.172833"}

It’s safe to say, love is in the air. So is horror and the paranormal.\n\nWhose House? Ron’s House\n\nMercedes Ron is a Wattpad star writer, so much so that Prime Video has created a ‘House Of Ron’ brand for all of the upcoming film and series interpretations of her novels. Ron’s Culpables series has defined the modern era of Wattpad adaptations, and in Culpa Mia (My Fault), Culpa Tuya (Your Fault) and Culpa Nuestra (Our Fault) have delivered Prime a hit franchise.\n\nIvory & Ebony Wrapped\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nTwo Enfrentados movies are coming, based on Ron’s two-book series. Marfíl (Ivory) and Ébano (Ebony) are made by Pokeepsie Films, which produced the Culpables trilogy and they tell us they are taking things up a level with the new movies. Ester Expósito (Élite) plays Marfil, the daughter of a Spanish tycoon whose NYC lifestyle is shaken after she is kidnapped and then released. Hugo Diego García (The Substance) is Sebastian, who is recruited as her bodyguard. The two movies were filmed back-to-back and shooting took place in Spain and New York.\n\nBoulevard Of Forbidden Romance\n\nThe first three of Flor M. Salvador’s ‘Boulevard’ series have racked up over 140M reads on Wattpad, and a fourth instalment is on the way. Hopes are high for the movie adaptations, with Sony Pictures and Webtoon making the features. The first movie, Boulevard, is in production in Spain with a screenplay from the pen of YA author Javier Ruescas. The books trace the forbidden romance between high school students Halsey Weigel and Luke Howland. She knows she should stay away from Luke, but is inexplicably drawn to him, seeing beyond the damaged exterior that everyone else is quick to judge.\n\nRunning Hot: Chasing Red\n\nChasing Red is filming in AlUla, Saudi Arabia, and is another much-anticipated Wattpad movie adaptation. Based on Isabelle Ronin’s novel, the plot turns on a straight-A student, Veronica, who refuses to be college heartthrob Caleb’s latest conquest…despite the undeniable chemistry between them. Circumstances see Veronica end up under Caleb’s roof, and secrets unravel in the slow-burn romance. Madelaine Petsch (The Strangers) and Gavin Casalegno (The Summer I Turned Pretty) have signed on as the leads. Mackenzie Munro directs from Lauren Schacher’s screenplay. Stampede Ventures produces alongside Wattpad Webtoon Studios.\n\nThree’s A Charm: Third Shift Society\n\nFlipping the script from webnovel to webcomic, and romance to paranormal, is Third Shift Society. Another one from Wattpad Webtoon Studios, Rehab Entertainment and the Jim Henson Company are also on board the adaptation of Meredith Moriarty’s title. It is being worked up as a supernatural series with Ray Utarnachitt (DC’s Legends of Tomorrow) on writing detail. The story follows Ellie whose world is upended when she meets paranormal detective Ichabod, who may hold answers to her psychic powers. The pair investigate paranormal mysteries involving ghosts, vampires, witches, demons, and more.\n\nSomething’s Wrong In Stagtown\n\nAnother webcomic adaptation in the works is Stagtown, with Benjamin Brewer, Lead VFX Artist on Everything Everywhere All at Once, writing and directing, and Margot Robbie’s Lucky Chap Entertainment and Wattpad Webtoon Studios producing. Comic artist Punko created ‘Stagtown’, and Brewer will bring it to life as a live-action movie. The webcomic follows Frankie, Jeremy, and Felix as they discover something is terribly wrong in the town of Stagtown and attempt to escape the horrors that the residents ignore.\n\nFrom The Heart: Love Me Love Me\n\nJune White moves to Italy for a fresh start after her brother’s death. At her new elite school, she is drawn to James, a dangerous bully involved in clandestine MMA fights, but then begins dating his best friend, Will. That’s the set-up for Love Me Love Me, an Italian YA movie, based on the first novel in the four-book series from Stefania S, and which has notched 23M-plus views. Prime Video has talked up the global appeal of the picture, which starts streaming in early 2026.\n\nDrive Get Into Gear\n\nTamara Lush has been one of Wattpad’s most popular writers for some time and has finally landed her first feature adaptation with her 2022 Wattpad original, Drive. The story follows a young female race-car mechanic who pretends to be engaged to the most scandalous racing star in the scene – officially for his reputation, but secretly to get her own chance behind the wheel. Soon the lie threatens to destroy everything, including what has long since become more than just a game. Amazon has teamed with Bavaria Fiction to adapt the webnovel, which Karsten Guenther is producing, Chris Silber and Malina Nwabuonwor wrote the screenplay, and Sergej Moya is directing. The film is set for a 2026 release.\n\nBad Boy’s Girl On The Starting Grid\n\nSpanish filmmaker Marçal Forés began shooting his latest feature, Bad Boy’s Girl, in early December. The film is adapted from the hugely popular Wattpad novel series of the same name, written by Blair Holde. The movie is a co-production between Italy and Spain with Lotus Production and Diamond Films España on board. The story follows Tessa O’Connell, who has only two goals for senior year: to keep her head down, and to get over the heartbreak of seeing her longtime crush date her ex-best friend.", "language": "en", "category": "entertainment", "source": "https://deadline.com/feed/", "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 00:01:00 +0000", "fetched_at": "2025-12-27T02:14:52.999574"}
